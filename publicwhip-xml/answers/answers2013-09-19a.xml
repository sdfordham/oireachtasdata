The first inspection report, along with recent  inspection reports into fostering services have indicated the pressures faced by social work staff and need for ongoing training, support and supervision.</p><p>  In 2012, of the part of the ongoing reform programme, HSE Children and Family Services established a national structure to manage the work of Workforce Development. This has provided, for the first time, a common national approach to ensuring consistency and quality assurance.</p><p>  As part of this systematic training needs analysis has being undertaken and a National Training Plan has been prepared. In accordance with this a prioritised programme of standardised training courses and complementary training modules is now being provided nationwide. Further specific courses have also been introduced to support the implementation of the Staff Supervision Policy 2013.</p><p>  Social workers are also assisted in their work by team leaders, principal social workers and other levels of management. There is also a range of guidance available to social workers, most recently the very comprehensive HSE Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook.</p><p>  An induction process involving full briefing and introduction of new staff under the supervision of line management has been introduced within the HSE. As well as the ongoing filling of replacement posts some 270 additional social worker posts have been filled as part of the implementation plan in response to the recommendations of the Ryan Report. </p><p>  In addition, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, 2005 provided for the establishment of a Social Workers Registration Board, which was appointed in 2010.  One of the functions of the Board is to set and enforce standards of education and training for the purposes of registration. These standards were developed in consultation with relevant stake-holders including employers, professional bodies, education and public representatives. </p><p>The Act makes provision for:</p><p>- the approval of education and training programmes</p><p>- the monitoring of continuing suitability of education and training programmes.</p><p>  The object of the Social Work Registration Board is to protect the public by fostering high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among social work registrants. The registration requirements will include a Continual Professional Development element and my officials will continue to liaise with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council (CORU), regarding emerging needs and priorities in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-19a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013091900047#WRA00700"><p>Considerable progress has been made to restrict the use of corporal punishment in Ireland. Corporal punishment in schools is banned, and regulations for creches, foster care and residential settings address the use of appropriate discipline. Corporal punishment in the home, while not specifically outlawed, is governed by the provisions of section 246 of the Children Act, 2001. Section 246 makes it an offence to assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's health or seriously affect his or her wellbeing. A limited defence of reasonable chastisement exists in common law for parents and persons acting in loco parentis, but successful high profile prosecutions have been taken by the State under section 246 where parents are deemed to have used excessive or unreasonable force in disciplining children. </p><p>  My Department is reviewing the complex policy, legal and constitutional issues involved and is also currently engaged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office to respond formally to the European Committee of Social Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE) in respect of matters raised through the committee around the banning of corporal punishment in all settings. The Government has been invited to make a submission to the Committee on the merit of the complaint and it is my intention to do so. In responding, the submission will allude to the significant progress which continues to be made in relation to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protect the rights of children, including the proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children&rsquo;s rights, the enactment of a suite of relevant DCYA and Justice legislation, and progress in relation to fundamental reform of the child protection services, the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, and drafting legislation in relation to putting Children First on a statutory basis. I will be keeping my Cabinet colleagues fully updated in this matter and will be discussing with them the full range of policy options available.</p><p>  There is a balance to be found between supporting parents in effective parenting, in particular, in use of non-violent forms of discipline, and the use of criminal law to impose criminal sanctions on parents who do not adhere to best practice in parenting. It is important to note that the general development of norms within Ireland and positive support and encouragement to parents has brought about a situation where physical punishment is increasingly avoided.  </p><p>  Recent research from the longitudinal study of children in Ireland shows that the great majority of parents do not use smacking as a form of discipline. The most frequently used method of discipline was &quot;discussing / explaining why the behaviour was wrong and this discipline strategy was used by almost ninety percent of mothers (88%).  Less than one percent (0.5%) of mothers reporting smacking their children &quot;regularly or always&quot;. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-19a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013091900047#WRA01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 163 together.</p><p>  I have the utmost concern for the position that the prospective adopters who were close to finalising adoptions from Russia now find themselves in following the recent changes to the Russian adoption process. I have received a large volume of representations on behalf of the applicants involved and I and my officials have actively been trying to assist those affected. </p><p>Following queries I initiated through diplomatic channels the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation has confirmed to the Irish Embassy that new legislation came into force on 3rd July 2013 which requires a child to be on the national adoption database for twelve months before that child is deemed eligible for intercountry adoption and may be placed on an international adoption database. The previous period was eight months. I understand the purpose of the amendment is to extend the period during which possibilities for domestic adoption are considered.</p><p>The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place. During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows applicants with a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt who had commenced the adoption process at the time of the commencement of the Act to continue with that adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country. Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must complete the process by the 31st October 2013. The issue that has arisen is that the changes introduced by the Russian authorities mean that a small number of Irish applicants will not be able to conclude their adoption of a Russian child by the 31<sup>st</sup> October 2013.  </p><p>In an effort to assist I have been using diplomatic channels to seek solutions for the applicants involved. These diplomatic channels have been used to fully outline the difficult situation these applicants have been put in following the change in Russian procedures and to explore possible solutions. The Irish Ambassador to Russia met with the Deputy Foreign Minister Titov in Moscow on 10th September 2013 and outlined the position and noted our desire for a degree of flexibility in relation to the implementation of the changes recently introduced, which has affected a small number of Irish applicants who were at an advanced stage in the adoption process. </p><p>I have also recently met with the Embassy Attach&eacute; from the Russian Embassy to Dublin who was representing the Russian Ambassador to highlight the current difficulties the sudden change in Russian legislation has created. This meeting was positive and the Attach&eacute; indicated that officials from the Ministry of Education in Moscow are aware of the issues and are examining them closely.   </p><p>Amongst the representations I have received is a proposal to amend the Adoption Act, 2010 to address this situation. As the Act is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Adoption Act, 2010 must be carefully examined.  Issues also arise in confining any such amendment to the cases immediately affected by the recent changes in Russia.  Nevertheless, these legislative issues are receiving consideration by my Department in parallel with the ongoing engagement with the Russian authorities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-09-19a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013091900047#WRA01175"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 29 and 38 together. </p><p>  The current free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education - ECCE programme - was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children before commencing primary school.  Almost every pre-school service in the State (more than 4,300) is participating with over 68,000 children, or 94% of the eligible age cohort, availing of free pre-school programme in the 2012/2013 school year.   </p><p>  In line with the Programme for Government, I succeeded in maintaining the universality of the free pre-school year, including securing an additional funding requirement of &euro;9.8m in 2012 to address increased demand due to an increase in births since 2009.</p><p>  The programme includes a number of additional provisions which take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.  In addition, to improve the services available to children with special needs, my Department is working with the Office of Disability and Mental Health in the Department of Health, to examine how supports to facilitate the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream pre-school settings can be improved.</p><p>  As I have outlined in response to an earlier question, My Department and I, along with key stakeholders including the HSE, are currently progressing an 8-point Pre-School Quality Agenda. The action being implement are designed to ensure the highest standards of care for children in pre-school and to ensure that parents and practitioners can have confidence in the regulation of the sector. I further believe that this Agenda must be implemented; and higher standard of quality ensured, in order to provide the key building blocks for any further extensive of universal childcare provision, including any proposal to introduce a second free pre-school year, which as I have indicated on numerous occasions is my ultimate objective.</p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early year&rsquo;s interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. I this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes as well as proving significantly beneficial to children with special needs. In addition a second pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and likely generate 4,000-5,000 new positions, albeit mostly part-time. The benefits of introducing a second year were further referred to in the OECD reports on Ireland published last week.</p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, with the additional cost broadly in line with the cost of the current one year provision, which is &euro;175 million.  This funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating.  However I would hope that this proposal is one which Government could continue to work towards as our public finances recover.</p><p>  Finally, I have this week received the Report and recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group which I established to advice my Department and I on the preparation of Ireland first-ever Early Years Strategy. Longer term objectives for early years care and education, including extension of universal early years provision, supports for children with specific needs and ongoing improvements in quality will be further addressed in this Strategy.</p></reply>

The Special Action Group on Obesity is chaired by the Department of Health and comprises key stake-holders, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It is recognised that alone, no single initiative will reverse the growing trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference. For this reason the Special Action Group is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as:</p><p>- Calorie posting in restaurants</p><p>- Healthy Eating Guidelines, including the Food Pyramid</p><p>- Marketing of  Food and Drink to Children</p><p>- Development of treatment guidelines</p><p>  The Department of Health has, with my full support, worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland towards a new Children's Code up to 18 years, which will restrict marketing of high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drink up to 7pm.</p><p>  The Department of Health and HSE have developed Treatment Guidelines which help inform primary care staff of the steps to be taken with regard to managing obesity. Both 'adult' and 'child' guidelines have been agreed with health care professionals and are now available.</p><p>  Within my Department, support was given for Local Authorities to run the annual National Recreation Week which this year had preventing obesity and overweight as one of its themes.</p><p>  In October and November a new media campaign will run which aims to give parents practical tips on preventing children becoming overweight and obese. This will be the start of a three year campaign which is a joint initiative between SafeFood, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  In conclusion my Department is prioritising support for the Department of Health in leading Ireland's effort to address the global epidemic of obesity which has been identified by the World Health Organisation.</p></reply>

This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to six years.  In addition, my Department has been actively driving a  comprehensive<b></b>Pre-School Quality Agenda. </p><p>  I have outlined to the Dail on several occasions, and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, eight key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  These are:</p><p>- Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5.</p><p>- Improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum.</p><p>- Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards.</p><p>- Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services.</p><p>- Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.</p><p>- Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible.</p><p>- Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.</p><p>- Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.</p><p>  Starting in September 2014, it is my intention to introduce new qualification requirements for the sector.  The qualification requirement for Pre-School Leaders will be increased to Level 6 requirement in childcare/early education.  In addition, all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be made subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  These requirements will apply to new services from September 2014 and to existing services from September 2015.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.  </p><p>Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991.  Inspections are carried out under the regulations by the Pre-School Inspectorate, to monitor compliance and ensure the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.     As I have outlined in recent weeks, a number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system, including the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.</p><p>In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department has also reviewed the penalties currently in place for breach of regulations with a view to increasing their range and severity.  I will be bringing draft legislative amendments in relation to this to Government very shortly and I expect these to be brought before the Houses during the current session.  Since July of this year, existing inspection reports are being published on-line by the Pre-School Inspectorate and all new inspection reports will also be published on-line on their completion.  </p><p>  A registration system has been introduced on an administrative basis for new pre-school services and is expected to be placed on a statutory basis in 2014.  This allows the Pre-School Inspectorate to determine whether a service is compliant in terms of suitability and service design before it will be permitted to operate.  This  is a further welcome development in the wider programme of work to secure and support the quality of pre school services.</p></reply>

There is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and childcare in the earliest years.  Investment in early childhood care and education benefits not only the individual child but also the future development of the wider economy.  I am also aware of the important economic contribution that childcare services provide through direct employment of staff in service delivery and through support for labour participation on the part of working parents. </p><p>The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low or relatively modest incomes. For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and qualifying income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.   Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with middle incomes may also benefit from subvention.  </p><p>The CETS<b></b>programme provides &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services in both the community and commercial sectors for qualifying trainees and students.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.</p><p>The ECCE programme provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  </p><p>In the Budget for 2013, I announced, along with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, an After-school Childcare Programme with provision of &euro;14 million in a full year.  This programme will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that some 6,000 quality after-school care places are provided to support children's development when the initiative is fully completed.</p><p>In 2013 the total expenditure by my Department on the childcare support programmes is expected to be in the region of &euro;260 million.  I believe that the investment made in childcare supports is an investment in our country's future prosperity.  I have, despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure, provided sufficient funding to ensure that the programmes are maintained, and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in excess of 100,000 children throughout the country are being supported by the programmes administered by my Department this year. </p></reply>

The Act was written against the backdrop of the of the Hague Convention and a commitment to improving standards outlined in the Convention. The Hague principles of subsidiarity, support for birth families, free and informed consent for birth parents, and international adoption as a resource for the permanent care of children, are a means for improving standards in intercountry adoption and mitigating against some of the risks inherent in intercountry adoption. </p><p>There are two existing legislative commitments in the Adoption Area.  The first is to provide, in a more effective and appropriate way, for the adoption of children o f marriage. The <i>Adoption (Amendment) Bill</i> were made published Children's Referendum and will be introduced as soon as  proceedings and processes relevant to the Referendum are concluded. </p><p>The second piece of adoption legislation which is being prepared is the  <i>Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.   </i>These issues are currently being examined within my Department and within the Office of the Attorney General. It is  my intention is to bring the Heads of Bill before Government at the earliest possible date to seek approval to refer this legislation to the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee for discussion.  </p><p>The Adoption Act 2010 has been in operation for nearly three years now.  Since taking office I have made improvements to the operation of the scheme, without the need to amend legislation following consultation with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Health Service Executive. In particular I have streamlined the assessment process for those seeking to transfer from declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which are due to expire before the 31st of October 2013. Furthermore I have moved to address the issue of the sustainability, and funding, of accredited bodies. In this matter interim funding has been provided to specific bodies and I am seeking agreement from these agencies on a pathway to securing a sustainable model for accredited bodies in the future. </p><p>Since the implementation of the Act, as is often the case with complex legislation, issues have arisen in relation to the operation of the Act.   There are  also more general policy questions around the nature of our adoption regime, with for example some seeing the development of options for an open adoption regime domestically as worthy of consideration. In the circumstances I think it is timely to consider a review of adoption.  Given the range and complexity of the issues this will require scoping and preliminary examination after which decisions will be made on the extent and time scale for the review. I do not know at this stage if proposals for legislative change will emerge from this review or the nature of such proposals.  Based upon the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption the issue of further legislative development will certainly be considered.    This review will inform future operational and legislative considerations regarding the Adoption Act 2010. </p></reply>

That Act was replaced most recently by the Adoption Act 2010 which also established the Adoption Authority of Ireland. All adoptions in Ireland since 1952 have been underpined by a legislative basis. </p><p>  While my Department's remit in this area relates to adoptions carried out under the relevant legislation I am aware that there have been concerns about informal adoptions or illegal registrations some of which are associated with some mother and baby homes. The issue in Ireland of illegal adoptions very much relates to illegal registrations, i.e. children who were given at birth to other individuals who registered these children as their own and who are now unable to access personal records and information.  I have met with individuals who have found themselves in these circumstance and I acknowledge and empathise with the dilemma that these individuals are addressing. </p><p>  Efforts have been made by the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the HSE, within their legal remit,  to facilitate the investigations that these individuals are undertaking in endeavouring to establish medical and/or identifying information about themselves.  </p><p>In consultation with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Health Service Executive, my Department is examining legislative and administrative options in relation to accessing records which may exist. I am also examining provisions in this regard in the forthcoming Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.   I have recently received further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in regard to complex legal and constitutional issues which have arisen during the course of drafting the Heads of Bill. These issues are currently under consideration in my Department. </p><p>  Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, which had responsibility for Bessboro, Co Cork, Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co Tipperary and Castlepollard, Co Westmeath. I am advised by the HSE that there has been very significant demand to access these files and consequently the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork has not been able to respond as quickly as would have been hoped. In parallel with facilitating such access, work by the HSE on the organising and storage of these files has taken place and planning is underway for reorganising the approach to dealing with information requests to improve access. </p><p>  I have no plans to initiate a public inquiry into the specific issue raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The areas I have identified are:</p><p>- Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5</p><p>- Improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum </p><p>- Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards</p><p>- Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services </p><p>- Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust</p><p>- Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible</p><p>- Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance</p><p>- Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.</p><p>My Department and I are working on a comprehensive Pre-School Quality Agenda. This includes the introduction of   National Quality Standards, which will be implemented later this year. These Standards contain a section on Organisation and Management which includes the following criteria:</p><p>- All  staff commence induction training in relation to all the policies and procedures of the service during their first week of employment</p><p>- Each staff member receives regular supervision and support in relation to all areas of their work</p><p>- The on-going training needs of staff are identified, addressed and provided for on a regular basis.</p><p>  I have highlighted in previous replies to D&aacute;il questions the responsibilities that the Child Care Regulations impose on pre-school managers in ensuring that suitable and competent staff are employed and that they are effectively supervised and monitored in order to ensure that the highest quality of care is provided to children attending the service.    The introduction of a more robust inspection regime will enforce the requirement for providers to place quality at the centre of the services they provide. </p><p>  Pre-school services are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006 as provided in the Child Care Act 1991. Under the Regulations the Health Service Executive has responsibility for the inspection of services and the enforcement of the regulations. Inspection is carried out to monitor compliance with the Regulations thereby ensuring the health, safety and welfare of children and the promotion of their development.   </p><p>A number of steps are being taken to improve the current inspection system.  These include the introduction of National Quality Standards for pre-school services later this year as part of the inspection process.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.    My Department is also undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-school) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution. </p><p>  I can confirm that, in the case of the three pre-school services featured in RTE's Primetime programme of 28 May 2013, complaints management and inspection review visits have taken place in each case.  In relation to the publication of pre-school service inspection reports, the HSE has begun the process of publishing retrospective reports on-line, and this process will continue over the coming weeks and months.  All new inspection reports from 1st July will be published on-line on completion.  The publication of these reports is being hosted by Pobal, and the reports are available on the Pobal website.</p><p>A new registration system has been introduced this month and new services wishing to open will be required to register with the HSE.  The HSE will determine whether the childcare service is compliant in terms of suitability and service design <i>before</i>   the service will be permitted to operate.  Following commencement of the service, actual care and welfare practices will be inspected.</p></reply>

Where there is no relative or person known to the child to provide relative care, the HSE where possible, will place a child in foster care.  For young people that are unable to live at home or in an alternative family environment residential care may be considered suitable.  Residential care can be in a home run by the HSE or by a voluntary or private company. </p><p>There are approximately 140 Children's Residential Centres in operation. These centres are typically found in domestic homes in housing estates, on the outskirts of towns and villages. The centres typically have between 3 to 6 children. These children are usually in their teens. Children living in the centres attend at local schools and take part in local sporting and community activities. Staff work a shift system and young people are allocated a key-worker. </p><p>The HSE has advised me that no HSE Social Care Worker staff hours have been reduced due to cuts in funding.</p><p>All children's residential centres are inspected against National Standards for Children's Residential Centres developed by the Department of Health. The HSE inspect and register children's residential centres run by the private and voluntary sectors.

This involves the introduction of new national standards against which all services will be inspected.  This will bring about greater consistency and transparency in the inspection process.  All new reports completed by inspectors are now being published on-line, providing open access to the public to inspection findings.  In addition, my Department is working with the HSE pre-school inspection service to clearly distinguish very serious breaches of Regulations from those that are more minor.  I have also undertaken to strengthen existing legislation to allow the HSE to more robustly pursue providers who do not meet inspection requirements.</p><p>  Finally, the staff of the HSE's pre-school inspection service will transfer to the new Child and Family Agency which will be established shortly.

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012. A number of submissions were received as part of the Committee's consultation process. Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First. Since then my Department and I have carried out international research and held further consultations with experts and key stakeholders, including other relevant Departments and statutory agencies, to discuss and review the complex matters arising and the development of the final Bill.</p><p>  It is also essential that the related and relevant legislation is compatible with and will complement the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Act.</p><p>  Revised Heads and General Scheme of the Children First Bill and drafting of this legislation by parliamentary counsel has been approved by Government. The proposed Children First Bill will place obligations on professionals working with children to report suspected child protection concerns, to share information and to engage in inter-agency and multi-disciplinary working and that organisations working with children will have safe practices and policies in place.</p><p>  It is my intention that establishments which provide pre-school services or school age services within the meaning of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 will be subject of the legislation.</p></reply>

This will be an important new development as, at present, staff working in childcare services other than under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, are not subject to any requirement in respect of qualifications.</p><p>  The ECCE programme introduced the first-ever requirement for minimum qualifications for staff working in the childcare sector.  The current requirement under the programme is that the pre-school leader delivering the pre-school provision must hold a qualification in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.</p><p>  The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.</p><p>  There is considerable international evidence that increasing the qualifications of staff working with children increases the quality of services.  It is essential, therefore, that all staff have qualifications on a formal recognised basis.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.</p></reply>

Unallocated cases are often cases where a child has just come into care and is awaiting allocation of a social worker or where a child is in a very stable fostering placement, provided perhaps, by a relative. Maternity leave, sick leave and movement of staff within the service can result in a case being unallocated for a short period of time.</p><p>  Cases that are unallocated are closely monitored, supported and case managed by the duty social work team under the supervision of the principal social worker. Cases are subject to ongoing review and, where appropriate, the level and nature of the support being provided will change depending on the needs of the child.</p></reply>

All are located on the same campus at Oberstown, near Lusk, Co. Dublin. These schools currently accommodate girls under 18 years of age on admission and boys under 17 years on admission whose detention is ordered by the Courts on remand or on conviction for criminal offences.  The Deputy will be aware that a construction project is to commence shortly in Oberstown to expand the capacity of the campus, to enable responsibility for detention of all young people under 18 years of age to be assigned to Oberstown in 2014.</p><p>  There has been a substantial increase in demand for male bed spaces on the Oberstown campus in 2013 compared to 2012.  This has been primarily but not exclusively driven by an increase in the number of boys aged 16 years old on admission detained in Oberstown.  As a result, there is a shortage of male bed spaces available in Oberstown at present.  While the trend in court outcomes for children requires further research, I am conscious that a number of measures are required to address the short term difficulties that have arisen in this area.</p><p>  Firstly, by agreement with staff, an independent review of the campus roster for care staff is to get under way shortly which will include the issues of the number of staff absences resulting from sickness, assaults and injuries, adequacy of staffing levels as well as the implementation of the Haddington Road Agreement.  This process will commence before the end of September and will be completed as soon as possible.</p><p>  My Department has also identified an ongoing trend of children exiting the HSE secure residential system and being remanded in custody to the Oberstown campus.  Both the Irish Youth Justice Service and HSE Child and Family Services are to further analyse this trend to establish if in certain cases the needs of the children concerned would be more appropriately addressed by way of community based services.</p><p>  I have authorised a reorganisation of staffing and services on the campus which will result in 4 additional male bed places in Oberstown Boys School before the end of this month, subject to legal advice.  This will include moving the location of Oberstown Girls School from its current location to a unit currently occupied by Oberstown Boys School, reducing the number of bed spaces for girls from 8 to 6 and increasing the number of male detention spaces in Oberstown Boys School from 20 to 24.</p><p>  My Department is also progressing plans for recruitment of staff to enable the reopening of an 8 bed unit for males in Trinity House School which is currently not available for use due to staffing issues.  A tender is to issue shortly for a pilot project to bring in between 10 &ndash; 20 residential care worker staff on an agency basis.  The intention is to run this project for a test period of up to 6 months, starting in October.  In addition, the first batch of new care staff due to arrive in early 2014 as part of the expansion of the campus for 17 year old males are, in the first instance, to be assigned to the existing children detention schools in order to ensure the required cover to open all detention beds that are currently certified for use.</p><p>  I have previously provided information in relation to absconds which took place from Oberstown Boys School in June of this year. The 3 boys in question were subsequently apprehended by the Gardai and returned to Oberstown.  I am advised that there has been a full review of security by the Director of Oberstown Boys School to prevent a recurrence of this incident.  While it can never be guaranteed that such incidents will be prevented, I am aware that there is a long history of a high level of security in Oberstown as well as excellent co-operation and communication with the local community.  The issue of security will remain an ongoing matter for review by the Board of management and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  I also note that there will be enhanced security on the campus as a result of the Oberstown capital project, which will include a new cordon barrier and fence as well as an expansion in CCTV coverage on the campus.</p></reply>

In so far as the HSE provides domestic violence services to victims, responsibility currently falls within the remit of the Department of Health and the HSE.  Children, as individuals, do not require the services of domestic violence shelters; they accompany the parent who requires these on occasion. Unaccompanied children make use of alternative services, under the Child Care Act 1991, and would not be placed in a domestic violence shelter.  The issue of domestic violence and associated services are included in the Bill providing for the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) given the close relationship between domestic violence and child protection issues. In this regard, the task force report on the establishment of the CFA noted the need for a robust co-ordinating mechanism to continue the appropriate multi-organisational approach.</p><p>  Ireland has no law or statute at present which specifically permits corporal punishment in the home setting.  However, Section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides very clear legal deterrents to the use of excessive physical discipline within the home setting or otherwise, as follows:</p><p>Section   <i>246.--(1) 'It shall be an offence for any person who has the custody, charge or care of a child wilfully to assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose the child, or cause or procure or allow the child to be assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, abandoned or exposed, in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's health or seriously to affect his or her well-being.'</i></p><p>In relation to corporal punishment within the home, a limited defence of <i>'reasonable chastisement'</i>   exists in common law, but successful high profile prosecutions have been taken by the State under section 246 where parents are deemed to have used excessive or unreasonable force in disciplining children.</p><p>  My Department is currently engaged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office to respond formally to the European Committee of Social Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE) in respect of matters raised through the committee around the banning of corporal punishment in all settings.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have certain functions and responsibilities for the Ombudsman for Children's Office under the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002. This primarily relates to governance matters, most notably the funding of the Ombudsman for Children's Office through the Vote of my Department.</p><p>  The Ombudsman for Children performs a very valuable ongoing role in advancing the rights and welfare of children in Ireland since her appointment to that role in 2003. In addition to her complaints and investigation functions, the Ombudsman for Children makes valuable ongoing contributions to Oireachtas Committees, provides advices to Government on legislation, policy and practices and raises public awareness of issues impacting on the lives of children and families.  I am also aware that the Ombudsman for Children's Office is constantly engaging with all relevant Government Departments about children's rights through their complaints and investigations, legislative, participation and education functions.</p><p>  I am in agreement with Ms. Logan that the absence of clearer protection for children's rights in the Constitution has had an adverse effect on children across a wide range of areas and that the State could do more to support Children's Rights.  The recent referendum on the rights of children is clear testament to the fact that this Government is committed to putting the rights and welfare of children at the centre of our policy considerations and delivery of services in Ireland. </p><p>  At the recent 13th European Regional Conference of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect held in Dublin, the Taoiseach gave his personal commitment to righting the wrongs of our past including our child protection failings and I echo the sentiments expressed by him.  As Minster for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for implementing this challenging agenda. </p><p>  As the first Government Department dedicated to children and young people, my Department has already brought a considerable focus to areas such as children in detention, in the care system or at risk of homelessness.  In addition I believe that the forthcoming establishment of the Child and Family Agency will bring a dedicated focus to child protection, family support and other key children's services for the first time in the history of the State and promote a focus on the rights of children, particularly vulnerable children in its work with other agencies.</p><p>  This will be further strengthened, in law, with the enactment in the coming months of Ireland's Children First Bill which will introduce a statutory requirement for inter-agency working and sharing-of-information which I am confident will help the further the advancement of children's right's in Ireland.</p></reply>

This Bill will provide for the amendment of Parts 9 and 10 of the Children Act 2001 on the basis of the Heads and General Scheme of the Bill which were then published.  The Bill is currently being drafted.  It is intended that the Bill will be introduced to the Houses during this session.</p><p>  The primary objective of the proposed Children Amendment Bill is to provide a statutory basis for the amalgamation of the three children detention schools.  This will complement and reinforce the initiatives to date to create a &ldquo;single campus&rdquo; ethos and maximise the use of shared services between all 3 existing children detention schools.</p><p>  A number of technical amendments will also be made to certain provisions to improve their workability and address lacunae which have been identified in practice in consultation with the office of the Attorney General.</p><p>  There are currently 3 children detention schools in the State: Trinity House, Oberstown Boys and Oberstown Girls schools. All are located on the same campus at Oberstown, near Lusk, Co. Dublin. These schools currently accommodate girls under 18 years of age and boys under 17 whose detention is ordered by the Courts on remand or on conviction for criminal offences.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, reforms have been underway towards integrated delivery of services across the three children detention schools with a view to the more efficient use of resources including the centralisation of services, common policies across the three schools and more efficient use of accommodation. The Board of Management, chaired by Mr. Joe Horan and school management are currently implementing a new cross-campus roster.</p><p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) has recently conducted a recruitment competition for the position of campus manager and it is intended that the successful candidate will, in due course, become the Director of the amalgamated campus.</p></reply>

The HSE anticipate that this will bring special care capacity from 17 in 2013 to 35 by 2016. Capital funding of &euro;26.4m for these additional places has been secured and it is confirmed that the planning for each of the projects in  this sector are at an advanced stage.</p></reply>

These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drug Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, the European Youth in Action Programme (administered by L&eacute;argas &ndash; the Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce &ndash; the President&rsquo;s Award.  In 2013 &euro;53.498m (including &euro;1.75m capital) has been made available for these schemes and services for young people.</p><p>  My Department, along with all Government departments, has been required to achieve significant savings on schemes and services in line with the reductions set out in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE). The savings required under the CRE in 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on the 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services. My Department will try to ensure that in the determination process for the 2014 allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, will be protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding. </p><p>  My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. In order to ensure that the maximum use is made of the available resources, my Department has afforded flexibility to youth services/grant administering agencies to reconfigure the funding allocations made by my Department on the basis of their knowledge of the local needs in their area subject always to the approval of the Department. It is the intention of my Department to continue to facilitate this flexibility going forward to 2014.</p><p>  There is no doubt that the current budgetary situation is challenging for many organisations. Officials of my Department have met with representatives of all the national organisations that are funded under the Youth Service Grant Scheme to share information and to hear from the organisations about the impact of the reductions in funding on the services that they provide. I have met with  , and continue to meet with, many youth projects and organisations from around the country to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times. </p></reply>

Corporal punishment in schools is banned, and regulations for creches, foster care and residential settings address the use of appropriate discipline. Corporal punishment in the home, while not specifically outlawed, is governed by the provisions of section 246 of the Children Act, 2001. Section 246 makes it an offence to assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's health or seriously affect his or her wellbeing. A limited defence of reasonable chastisement exists in common law for parents and persons acting in loco parentis, but successful high profile prosecutions have been taken by the State under section 246 where parents are deemed to have used excessive or unreasonable force in disciplining children. </p><p>  My Department is reviewing the complex policy, legal and constitutional issues involved and is also currently engaged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office to respond formally to the European Committee of Social Rights of the Council of Europe (CoE) in respect of matters raised through the committee around the banning of corporal punishment in all settings. The Government has been invited to make a submission to the Committee on the merit of the complaint and it is my intention to do so. In responding, the submission will allude to the significant progress which continues to be made in relation to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protect the rights of children, including the proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children&rsquo;s rights, the enactment of a suite of relevant DCYA and Justice legislation, and progress in relation to fundamental reform of the child protection services, the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, and drafting legislation in relation to putting Children First on a statutory basis. I will be keeping my Cabinet colleagues fully updated in this matter and will be discussing with them the full range of policy options available.</p><p>  There is a balance to be found between supporting parents in effective parenting, in particular, in use of non-violent forms of discipline, and the use of criminal law to impose criminal sanctions on parents who do not adhere to best practice in parenting. It is important to note that the general development of norms within Ireland and positive support and encouragement to parents has brought about a situation where physical punishment is increasingly avoided.  </p><p>  Recent research from the longitudinal study of children in Ireland shows that the great majority of parents do not use smacking as a form of discipline. The most frequently used method of discipline was &quot;discussing / explaining why the behaviour was wrong and this discipline strategy was used by almost ninety percent of mothers (88%).  Less than one percent (0.5%) of mothers reporting smacking their children &quot;regularly or always&quot;.</p></reply>

The service is operating in a climate of increased demand particularly in the area of child neglect.  Since 2006 the number of referrals of child protection and welfare reports has almost doubled from 21,000 in 2006 to 40,000 in 2012.  The increase in 2012 was almost 10,000 above the 2011 level.</p><p>  The latest HSE employment census indicates that the number of whole-time equivalent (WTE) social workers employed in the HSE Children and Families service area was 1,397 at the end of June 2013. The census numbers reflect the outcome of a process of re-classification of social workers within the HSE into individual care groups, including Children and Families, to support the process of establishing the new Child and Family Agency. </p><p>  Child Welfare and Protection services have also been faced with particular challenges over recent months arising from a high number of vacancies due to maternity leave and to a lesser degree sick leave.  In response to these pressures a   new panel of professionally qualified social workers was established  in June 2013 to allow for the filling of vacancies in social work teams. A total of 112 vacant social worker posts have been approved for filling from this panel with the position being kept under constant review.</p></reply>

Section 56 of the Northern Ireland Act1998 required the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, with the approval of the Assembly, to make arrangements for obtaining the views of the Civic Forum.The Forum was set up in October 2000 and was suspended along with the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2002. Following the restoration of devolved powers in May 2007, the then First Minister and deputy First Minister considered the position of the Civic Forum in the re-established devolved arrangements and commissioned a review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of its structure, operation and membership. In April 2013 the NI Assembly voted in favour of an SDLP motion to re-establish the Civic Forum.   In my ongoing contacts with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive including in the context of the North South Ministerial Council, I have pressed for the re-establishment of the Civic Forum as a valuable and, as yet, unimplemented provision of the Good Friday Agreement.     I welcome the recent invitation which Richard Haass, independent chair of the all-party talks, has given to community groups and to representatives of wider civil society to contribute ideas to the talks process.</p><p>  In my address to the British Irish Association on 7 September, 2013, I pointed out that Northern Ireland was currently facing many difficult issues and that it was neither sensible nor realistic to expect the political system to shoulder these on its own.  I have previously put on the record of the D&aacute;il that I support the establishment of a Civic Forum which would provide for a broad range of voices on community relations and stimulate informed public debate in relation to key societal challenges.    </p><p>  I will be hosting a Reconciliation Networking Forum event in Dublin Castle on 16 October 2013 for people who are involved in community, peace-building, public policy or reconciliation work, to discuss what civil society, including the community sector, can and should do to meet the reconciliation challenges ahead.   This is in line with the view of the Government that a strong and resilient civic society can play an important role in building a more reconciled and prosperous Northern Ireland.      </p></reply>

While the Northern Ireland administration will therefore propose the agenda on this occasion, it is likely that discussions will touch on financial, economic and EU matters and that Ministers from North and South will together take the opportunity to review  the work undertaken in the areas of North South cooperation, including by the North-South implementation bodies,  since the preceding plenary meeting  on  5 July 2013.

The meeting benefitted from the presence of US Secretary of State Kerry, who has played a critical and energetic role in bringing these talks into being and in shepherding them forward, and who briefed us on progress so far. The details of those discussions are, rightly, being kept confidential. But Secretary Kerry advised us that the parties were engaging seriously, had progressed beyond other recent efforts, and that he still envisaged a comparatively short and concentrated process, lasting less than a year.</p><p>  On the EU side my colleagues and I, for our part, committed to doing all we can to support the process.</p></reply>

This relief will apply to purchases made on or after 1st July 2013.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the operation of the scheme, that repayments under the scheme may be made to licensed road haulage and bus operators. Bus operators established in the State must hold either an international road passenger operator&rsquo;s licence or a national road passenger operator&rsquo;s licence issued under the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006. Bus operators established in another EU Member State must hold an equivalent licence recognised under EU law. Similarly, road haulage operators in the State must hold either an international road haulage operator&rsquo;s licence or a national road haulage operator&rsquo;s licence, issued under the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006. Road haulage operators established in another EU Member State must hold an equivalent licence recognised under EU law.</p><p>All claimants must hold a current tax clearance certificate or, in the case of a claimant based in other EU Member State, a statement from the tax authority of that Member State that the claimant is tax compliant in that Member State.  The amount of the repayment will vary in accordance with the average price at which auto-diesel is available for purchase during a repayment period. This will be calculated in accordance with a sliding scale, whereby the maximum amount repayable will be 7.5 cent per litre (when that price is &euro;1.54 per litre or over), and Nil when the price is at or below &euro;1.23 per litre, as set out in the table below.</p><p><b>Amount Repayable</b>   (per litre)</p><p><table><tr><th>Price (VAT Incl)</th><th>Price (VAT Excl)</th><th>Repayment<br />(cent per litre)</th></tr><tr><td>1.54</td><td>1.25</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>1.50</td><td>1.22</td><td>6.6</td></tr><tr><td>1.45</td><td>1.18</td><td>5.4</td></tr><tr><td>1.40</td><td>1.14</td><td>4.2</td></tr><tr><td>1.35</td><td>1.10</td><td>3.</td></tr><tr><td>1.30</td><td>1.06</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>1.27</td><td>1.03</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>1.23</td><td>1.00</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p><p>For this calculation, the average price of auto-diesel will be determined in accordance with data provided by the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>The auto-diesel must be purchased for use in the transport operator&rsquo;s qualifying vehicles in the course of business transport activities. It must, in the case of road haulage, be used in a road haulage vehicle with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. For passenger transport, the vehicle concerned must be classified as an M2 or M3 vehicle under the EU &ldquo;type approval&rdquo; Directive 2007/46/EC. This includes buses, and minibuses with seating for a minimum of nine passengers.</p><p>The auto-diesel must be purchased in the State by the qualifying road transport operator, either in bulk or by means of a fuel card approved for that purpose by Revenue. Bulk purchases may be made only from a mineral oil trader in the State where that mineral oil trader holds a current auto-fuel trader&rsquo;s licence. Where the diesel is purchased and delivered from a trader in another Member State, that delivery must be made, documented and recorded in accordance with the requirements of excise law.</p><p>Before any claim is made in respect of diesel purchased by means of a fuel card, that fuel card must be approved by Revenue and included in the data provided at the time of registration with Revenue under the scheme by the qualifying road transport operator. A fuel card will be approved where the fuel card provider, or another entity acting for or in cooperation with the fuel card provider, undertakes to provide the information required by Revenue, about purchases and customer information associated with their cards, and continues to satisfy that undertaking.</p><p>The scheme will operate on the basis of electronic registration and claims, using the Revenue&rsquo;s Online System (ROS). Qualifying road transport operators will be required to register on-line with Revenue before any claim for repayment is submitted. The Revenue Online System (ROS) is currently being developed for that purpose, with a view to accepting registrations and claims under the scheme before the end of the year. Claims may be made in respect of diesel purchased during a three-month repayment period (beginning on the first day of January, April, July and October).</p><p>Revenue has briefed representatives of coach operators of the scheme requirements and is available to provide further briefing as the need arises. Comprehensive guidance on the rebate scheme is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The Commissioners further advise that it is not possible to state the precise amount of LPT which is expected to be collected for 2013 or 2014 for County Kerry.  A numbers of factors could affect the outcome, including the continuation of the strong level of voluntary compliance that was achieved in 2013, the impact of Revenue's national compliance programme to follow up with those liable persons who have failed to meet their LPT obligations for 2013, and the level of deferrals of LPT staying constant.  </p><p>  However, since the LPT charge for 2013 was for a half year, a reasonable estimate at this stage is that the amount of LPT expected from County Kerry in 2014 would be double the published figures for 2013.

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector. The measure was estimated to cost &euro;120 million in 2011, &euro;350 million in 2012, &euro;350 million in 2013, and &euro;60 million in 2014.  As the rate was introduced for a defined period, failure to revert the 9% rate to 13.5% would give rise to an annual Budget shortfall of &euro;350m from 2014.   With regard to the economic impact on the tourism sector due to the introduction of the 9% VAT rate, the most recent data available from the CSO of economic growth broken down by sector relates to the year 2009 so I am unable to provide analysis in relation to 2011.   Expenditure by overseas travellers to Ireland recorded an increase of 0.6% in 2012 compared with 2011. In addition, Q1 2013 recorded an increase in expenditure of 12% compared with the same period last year.   There is a clear impact in terms of employment in the accommodation and food service sector which has increased by over 13% between the period Q2 2011 to Q2 2013 &ndash; an increase of 15,000 jobs in the sector.  In terms of numbers of trips to Ireland, for the period May to July, the number of trips increased by 7.6% on the same period last year, while for the period January to July, the number of trips to Ireland increased by 6.0%.</p><p>  In line with best international practice the 9% VAT rate was introduced as a temporary measure and is due to expire at end December 2013, at which point it will revert to 13.5%. Retaining the 9% rate would be very costly to the Exchequer and would require an increase in taxation or reduction in expenditure elsewhere.

Specifically, Article 73 of the Directive provides that the taxable amount shall include everything which constitutes consideration obtained or to be obtained by the supplier, in return for the supply. Irish VAT legislation must comply with the EU VAT Directive and therefore there is no scope to reduce the taxable amount to which VAT applies in the circumstances described by the Deputy.   Where the vendor of a refurbished property makes a taxable sale of the property, the VAT on input costs incurred in the refurbishment of the property is deductible.  Where the vendor makes an exempt sale of the property, no input VAT is deductible and no VAT liability arises.  The rules that govern whether a property sale is taxable or exempt are contained in Section 94 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 and are described in the VAT on Property and Construction section on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

The tax is an excise duty and, as with most other excise duties, the liability arises at the earliest point in the supply chain following importation or manufacture in the State. Suppliers, whether importers or manufacturers, become liable for the tax at the time they make the first supply of the solid fuel to traders, or directly to the public, and are obliged to make a return and pay the solid fuel carbon tax to Revenue within one month of the end of each two-month accounting period. This arrangement reduces the number of traders obliged to make returns and accordingly, limits the overall administrative burden of the tax on the fuel trade and on Revenue.   Northern Ireland based suppliers of solid fuels who are selling direct to households in the State, are obliged to register as suppliers with Revenue for solid fuel carbon tax purposes and comply with the same regulatory requirements as suppliers based in the State. Where a Northern Ireland based supplier sells solid fuel to a supplier based in the State, the State-based supplier is liable for the tax when he/she supplies the solid fuel to his/her customers.</p><p>  All supplies of solid fuels must comply with the Air Pollution Act, (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 326 of 2012), made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. These regulations specify the standards for coal placed on the market and the obligations on suppliers in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State, including registration with the Environmental Protection Agency and compliance with fuel quality and packaging standards. These Regulations are enforced by the Local Authorities.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the present arrangements for collecting the solid fuel carbon tax are reasonable and I have no plans to change them.</p></reply>

It is the duty of the board to provide, or cause to be provided an education for all students attending the school.  In September 2009 my Department issued circulars 59/2009 and 60/2009.  These circulars provide a framework for schools to manage underperformance and conduct cases.  The new school self-evaluation system requires principals and teachers to identify what they are doing well and what needs to improve.  Also, there is a well-established system of external inspection covering all schools.  The Inspectorate's evaluations are based on classroom observations of teaching and a strong focus on learner outcomes.</p><p>  Further guidance to parents on progressing a concern in relation their child's school is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i></p><p>The Deputy may be aware of my commitment to the creation of a parents' charter, to strengthen the relationships between parents and schools and to set out the rights of parents.

Qualifications Recognition aims to provide fair recognition for foreign qualifications through the implementation of LRC guidelines and best practices. Criteria used to assess comparability include the following where applicable and in no particular order: - Status of the awarding body in the country of origin- Access requirements- Progression opportunities- Purpose for which assessment is sought-Level on national Qualifications Framework- Referencing to over-arching Qualifications Frameworks - Learning outcomes- Credits/Volume of learning Since 2008, Qualifications Recognition has been presented with 14 applications for recognition of Doctoral Degrees (Ph.

The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

This rate cut will be worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.</p></reply>

It was also agreed that a review of 22 projects should be carried out.  Following completion of that review in January 2012, a total of 43 projects had been cancelled, while 50 were maintained, to be managed in the same way as other regionally based offices and Departments.  It was agreed that one project - the Defence Forces in the Curragh -  should proceed, on a cost effective basis, as soon as budgetary resources permit.  </p><p>  Up to the date of the cancellation of the programme, about a third of the target numbers -  over 3,400 -  were decentralised.  While the decentralised offices account for less than 10% of serving civil service staff, taken together with the pre-existing regional and district offices of Departments the proportion of civil servants working outside Dublin is now just over 50%. </p><p>  Given the need to focus on programmes and projects that will best support economic recovery, as well as the ongoing necessity to achieve significant expenditure savings and efficiencies, there are no plans at the present time to introduce a further programme of decentralisation.</p></reply>

This compares to employees in respect of whom a combined 14.75% rate, under full-rate PRSI Class A, is paid giving entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits including jobseeker's benefit.</p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit may claim means tested jobseeker's allowance. Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services. Typically over 80% of jobseeker's allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years. </p><p>  Previously self-employed persons in receipt of jobseeker's allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p><p>  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p><p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status. Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through F&Aacute;S training, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course. Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p><p>  Additionally it may be noted that the primary purpose of social insurance credits is to secure the social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay social insurance, such as during periods of unemployment or illness. The class at which a contributor last paid determines entitlement to credited contributions and, while credits are not available to a person who has only self-employed contributions, persons who cease to be covered by compulsory social insurance, may opt to protect their existing long-term social insurance pension entitlements by becoming insured on a voluntary basis and paying voluntary contributions.</p></reply>

The Pensions Board supervises the regulation of individual schemes in accordance with the Pensions Act.  </p><p>  In general terms, I can advise that funded defined benefit pension schemes are required to satisfy the Funding Standard as set out in the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  This is a wind up standard which means that a funded defined benefit pension scheme is required to maintain sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme in the event of the wind up of the scheme. Where a scheme fails to satisfy the Funding Standard, the scheme is required to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board setting out how it is proposed to restore scheme funding.  </p><p>  I amended the Pensions Act in 2012 to require defined benefit pension schemes to hold additional funding in the form of a risk reserve in order to provide stronger protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. This requirement will apply in a gradual way from 2016.  I also amended the Pensions Act this year to provide the Pensions Board with the power to wind up a pension scheme. This power can only be exercised where a scheme is underfunded and the trustees and the employer are not in a position to adopt a funding proposal or where the trustees of a scheme fail to comply with a direction from the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits. </p><p>  My objectives with regard to regulation are to ensure that measures are in place to protect the pension rights of scheme beneficiaries.</p></reply>

The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord. </p><p>  I do not intend to introduce any legislative measures in this respect. The fact that approximately 82,500 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation. In terms of policy direction, the Government has approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) including the transfer of responsibility for rent supplement recipients with an established housing need from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities. Officials in this Department are working closely with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to assist with the necessary work required to initiate HAP. </p></reply>

The scheme enables an eligible jobseeker in receipt of a social welfare payment to continue to receive income support while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  In line with the BTEA&rsquo;s objectives, a person holding a level 7 degree can apply and be approved for a level 8 add-on year (honours bachelor degree) provided that it relates to the same discipline.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  Self-employed workers may also access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>  On 6 September 2013 I published the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare Group's report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons so as to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. </p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work because of a long-term illness or incapacity through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  This is in line with the estimated level of contributions needed to provide access for the self-employed to Invalidity Pension contained in the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund. </p><p>  In the course of the Group's deliberations, the Group identified a range of issues associated with the subject of social insurance for the self-employed that should be addressed and have made a number of recommendations in this regard.  These include, among others, the means assessment for self-employed income in terms of accessing jobseeker's allowance payments, credited PRSI contributions, self-employed access to activation and training schemes and the role that information campaigns might play in addressing information deficits, particularly with regard to entitlements to jobseeker's allowance.</p><p>  The question as to whether the present arrangements regarding social insurance for the self-employed are appropriate has increased in prominence over recent years.  I welcome the Group's finding that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  The recommendation concerning long-term sickness or injuries is an important contribution to the policy debate regarding the range of benefits the self-employed might access through their social insurance contributions.  In this regard, the 2010 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published last year, determined that the self-employed are obtaining better value for the level of their current social insurance contributions than employees (the Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%).  This finding was noted by the Advisory Group in its recommendations.  Consequently, the recommendations of the Advisory Group require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the 2010 Actuarial Review relating to the level of contributions levied on Class S contributors and the current shortfall in this regard.</p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will now carefully reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

The means test for State pension (non-contributory) assesses the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse or partner.  Where the State pension (non-contributory) is higher than the State pension (contributory), the higher of the determined pension entitlement may be awarded.  A claimant may wish to apply to transfer from the State pension (contributory) to the higher rate of (non-contributory) pension if this is the case.  Where claimants wish to apply for both pensions, the Department will award the higher pension.</p><p>  In terms of fairness, my Department provides a safety net for those who do not qualify for schemes as a result of their contribution history.  The non-contributory state pensions falls into this category and it has to be borne in mind that this pension is a means-tested payment and differs substantially in qualifying conditions from the contributory pension, which is based on the number of social insurance contributions made and is linked to the person's employment  record.</p></reply>

The local government funding model will change considerably in 2014.  Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.</p><p>  The general issue of local government sector funding in 2014 will be decided in the context of Budget 2014.  In advance of the Budget it is not possible to comment in detail on the funding situation of the sector as a whole, or on the 2014 position of specific local authorities, such as Kerry County Council.  The setting of commercial rates in 2014 is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move, from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.  The approach used to allocate the 20% of Local Property Tax revenue available for equalisation will depend on factors such as overall yield and yields at individual local authority level.  The priority will be to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p><p>  Placing the local government sector on a more sustainable financial footing is an important objective of the changes to the funding of local authorities.  I am satisfied that the changes which are currently underway will deliver a model of funding which is sustainable in the broadest sense into the long-term.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in the internal operations of LDCs and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of each company, as the employer, to manage.</p><p>  The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the &lsquo;harder to reach&rsquo; in the most disadvantaged areas and communities.  The funding provided under the LCDP may, however, be used towards statutory redundancy costs in certain circumstances.  Also, my Department has made a separate Technical Assistance Budget available on two previous occasions, in 2009 and 2011, to fund statutory redundancy costs arising within the LCDP.</p><p>  In the context of the RDP each LDC is permitted to spend 20% of its total Programme expenditure on administration and overhead costs including any employment related overheads.</p><p>  The Government recognises that like all other sectors, the Community and Voluntary Sector has faced financial constraints in recent years, with implications, inter alia, around the capacity of the sector to pay redundancy payments. Discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are on-going on the nature of an appropriate response.</p><p>  I believe that the recommendations on alignment between Local Government and local development made by an expert Steering Group represent a balanced way forward and they recognise the key strengths of LDCs, which will continue to be utilised in partnership with Local Government, to bring greater strategic coherence to the broad range of local and community development supports at local level, for the benefit of our citizens and communities.</p><p>  Future co-ordination arrangements between Local Government and LDCs are under consideration by an Alignment Working Group, which includes representatives of the Irish Local Development Network as well as the City and County Managers Association and Pobal.   </p></reply>

It does not seek to remove powers in relation to planning or housing from local authorities.  The Action Programme includes a new system of municipal governance at sub-county level. Elected members will perform certain reserved functions at district level without duplication of decision-making at county level, while other decisions will be taken by members at council level.</p><p>  The division of functions between county and district levels will be decided by what is relevant to each level. Local matters will be dealt with at district level while those of wider strategic application will be dealt with at county level. Any matter that is to be decided within the municipal district jurisdiction will be dealt with on a fully devolved basis and will not be submitted to county level for approval, subject to certain requirements in relation to consistency.</p><p>  The provision for decisions to be taken at the appropriate level of governance within the county will enhance rather than diminish accountability between the local authority and the general public.</p></reply>

Belgium, France and Germany also participated in this joint return operation.</p><p>  In enforcing the law in this respect, Ireland is no different to other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory. Ireland, like other EU member states, uses deportation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as the policy of last resort.  The process leading to a deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders. It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.</p><p>  Deportations take place within the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and after each case has been fully considered with regard to the eleven considerations contained in Section 3 (6) of that Act and Section 5 Prohibition of refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996.  The safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.<font color="#000080"> </font> My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries, including the DRC.</p><p>  Each asylum application received from a citizen of the DRC is considered on the basis of the facts, individual circumstances and merits of the case presented and a final decision is reached following a comprehensive examination and investigation of these facts, merits and circumstances taking full account of the political and human rights conditions prevailing in DRC and the latest reports of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.</p><p>  The enforcement of a Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. In general, removals are either carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return.  Alternatively, chartered flights organised through the EU FRONTEX network are often led by another EU State and this determines the timing of specific operations including to the DRC.</p></reply>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for subsidiary protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p><p>  In the event that the application for subsidiary protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a final decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that as the person concerned has no current right of residency in the State, he would not be in a position to meet the lawful residency criteria applicable to persons applying to my Department for a Certificate of Naturalisation.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have no ownership, planning or operational role in relation to the organisation. </p><p>  I have been made aware of a case brought by the Dairy Council of Northern Ireland against the NDC with the European Commission DG for Competition.  It is true to say that the NDC is engaged in promoting its members' products under the packaging mark &#8220;<i>Farmed in the Republic of Ireland&#8221;.</i>    If that is the activity at the centre of the case, I can confirm that the marketing campaign is not supported by public funds, has not been adopted in any way by the State and is not ascribable to my Department.  In fact, those activities are supported by voluntary milk levies collected from the NDC's member dairy co-ops.  I understand such marketing campaigns, funded entirely by the private sector, are not uncommon in other Member States.  </p><p>  With regard to competition, I have strong views on the importance of protecting the Single Market in the EU and I oppose any anti-competitive practices that might adversely affect free trade.  The Irish Agri-Food sector is export orientated and we should be cognisant of the importance of overseas markets as an outlet for our produce.  I am not aware of any complaints to the Irish Competition Authority in relation to the activities of the NDC.  In any event, any such complaint would be objectively examined by that body in its role as competent authority in the competition area.  My Department would not have a role in any such examination, though it would, of course, provide any assistance sought and co-operate fully with the Authority if required.   </p></reply>

The applicant employs a forestry company to do the establishment work and, as with any service provided, he/she must pay the company for the work completed. The plantation owner may pay the contractor directly or he/she may sign a mandate that requests my Department to redirect the grant(s) to the forestry company. It must be noted that the mandate is an agreement between the owner and the forestry company and my Department is not party to it; the mandate is merely an instruction to my Department to pay the owner&rsquo;s grant on their behalf to the contractor.</p><p>  An afforestation contract is between the applicant and my Department, and the contractor is not party to that contract. Therefore, any money paid and/or to be recouped under an afforestation contract is a matter between my Department and the applicant.  Any contract that exists between a forestry company and a plantation owner is a matter between those parties and any matter arising under such a contract, such as for example planting fewer trees than there should be, is a matter for the owner and the forester to resolve.  On this basis, if my Department must recoup an overpayment, the recoupment is sought from the scheme applicant who benefited from the payment and the resultant asset.</p></reply>

The reports show that in 2012, the HSE received 19,044 referrals of child abuse and 21,143 referrals of child welfare concerns.</p><p>  I have been advised by the HSE that there are a variety of measures in place to ensure the safety of children in State care.  Firstly, a thorough assessment of their needs is carried out prior to being taken into care or, in the case of an emergency, shortly after being taken into care.  Children are then placed with carers who have being thoroughly assessed and meet the strict criteria as set down by the HSE.  Once a child is placed the placement is closely monitored by the child's allocated social worker, and child is visited in the foster home or residential unit. </p><p>  Staff in residential units receive ongoing supervision and training to ensure that they understand their role as carers and ensure the safety of children in their care. Foster carers also receive support from a link social worker and are provided with training.  The Regulations provide that care plans for children in care are reviewed every six months for the first two years and then annually thereafter unless there is a change in circumstance when a special review may take place.</p><p>  Absconsions and missing in care episodes can occur from time to time.  The HSE has a joint protocol with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage such incidents, which was revised in 2012.  Senior HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na meet on a regular basis to monitor the number of missing children.  </p><p>  Any allegations of concern or complaint by a child against carers or others are dealt with in line with Children First, National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011.  Assessments are carried out in relation to their ongoing safety and they are moved to alternative placement where necessary.  </p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority monitors the HSE to ensure compliance with the Child Care Regulations 1995 the National Standards for Foster care and the National Standards for Residential Care, all of which clearly set out the role for the state in relation to the care, protection and the safeguarding of children in care. HIQA has undertaken over 500 inspections of residential care centres since 2000 and 27 foster care inspections.  Similarly, the HSE Inspection and Monitoring service also inspects and monitors the private foster and residential care  providers to ensure compliance with the Regulations and the National Standards.  As of May 2013 there was 6441 children in care, 91% had an allocated social worker.  80% approximately of foster carers as of June 2013 had an allocated link worker</p></reply>

Our Programme for Government commits that &ldquo;we will encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students.&rdquo;	</p><p>  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, to which my Department contributed, is being led by the Department of Education and Skills. These actions require collaborative work with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and ensure a safer childhood. New anti-bullying procedures have now been published by my colleague Minister Quinn which place a requirement on all recognised schools to record, investigate and address incidences of bullying in a structured manner. The procedures specifically include incidences of cyberbullying, both in and out of the school context or the posting of hurtful messages, images or statements on social media sites, within the definition of bullying.</p><p>  The new procedures highlight the need for parents and young people to understand how to use modern technologies safely; they must recognise the risks associated with the cyber world and know how to protect themselves in school, at home and in their communities. This includes raising awareness of  available tools within social media platforms such as privacy settings, how to block other users and the use of the complaints mechanisms provided.</p><p>  The www.webwise.ie site provides valuable information and advice for parents and teachers about the risks involved and how to protect children against cyber bullying. It is important to encourage anyone who is subjected to bullying to contact the Garda&iacute; and Health Service Executive as appropriate to report the matter.</p><p>  On the question of an alert system, the Deputy may be aware of the Safer Internet Ireland Project, which is coordinated by the Office for Internet Safety under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality. This EU supported project provides awareness, hotline and helpline functions and activities in Ireland. The website Hotline.ie is supported and funded by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland to provide a means for individuals to easily report incidences of illegal activity on the internet. </p><p>  The recent report by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications entitled &ldquo;Addressing the Growth of Social Media and Tackling Cyberbullying  &rdquo; is very helpful to our collective efforts to address these issues. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is leading the Government's consideration of this wide ranging report. This report includes a series of recommendations in response to the growing concerns over cyberbullying and its impact on young people. In light of the scale and the transnational nature of social media platforms and the web-based industry in general, the Oireachtas Committee recognised the requirement for collective EU-wide responses. The European Commission Strategy for a Better Internet for Children (2012) will play a key role in this regard. </p><p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and to advance measures to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector. There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people. </p><p>   The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services. In 2014 the savings required in the youth budget under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure amount to &euro;2.976m which entails a 5% cut across most schemes and programmes and a 10% cut on the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which the national youth organisations are funded.  Funding of &euro;1.035m under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme has not been reduced for the past two years.  Some 1,600 volunteer-led youth clubs and groups are funded under this scheme.</p><p>  I have met, and will continue to meet, with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of the savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and to see how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available in order to continue to support the provision of quality youth services to young people. Officials of my Department have also met with representatives of all the national organisations that are funded under the Youth Service Grant Scheme to share information and to hear from the organisations about the impact of the reductions in funding on the services that they provide.</p><p>  In addition, in order to maximise the use of the available resources,  my Department has afforded flexibility to the organisations/grant administering agencies to reconfigure the funding allocations made by the Department based on their knowledge of local needs in their areas of responsibility, subject to the approval of my Department.  It is intended to extend this facility into 2014 in order to ensure the continued provision of quality youth services to young people in these challenging times.</p></reply>

My Department occasionally receives calls from individuals concerned about the safety and wellbeing of a child. In all such cases my officials provide whatever assistance is required to allow such an individual make a proper referral to the statutory authorities. Such assistance can often include my officials contacting the HSE directly on behalf of a correspondent. </p><p>  In the case of missing children, these cases should always be notified to the Gardai in the first instance. In addition, the 116000 Missing Children Hotline is an EU - wide initiative designed to provide a single point of contact across the European Union for missing children and their families. In Ireland the service is operated by the ISPCC.  Funding for the operation of the line in Ireland is being provided by my Department and the EU, through its Daphne funding stream. The funding received from both the EU Daphne fund and from DCYA includes the establishment costs, national promotion and advertisement of the service. The Missing Children Hotline has been operating on a limited hours pilot basis in Ireland since December 2012 and on a  full-time 24/7 basis since end April, 2013. The service was officially launched on 5 June last. </p><p>  My Department is also taking a lead role in Children First implementation issues. An Interdepartmental Group has been established to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure consistency of approach. The group also provides a forum for sectors to raise and discuss overarching policy issues around Children First and reporting. I would emphasise however that this is not a mechanism for reporting, or dealing with, individual cases. </p></reply>

Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU, together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the HSE, has developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset.  This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie. For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan. The SDU and the NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p><p>  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.

There have been a number of developments in this area in recent years including the new Nutley Wing (opened summer 2012) at St Vincent's University Hospital (SVUH); a new purpose-built dedicated Ambulatory Outpatient facility at Beaumont for patients with Cystic Fibrosis; the provision of specialist adult and paediatric centres at a number of hospitals and screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis. </p><p>  In relation to Cork University Hospital I am informed that the hospital is both an Adult and a Paediatric centre for patients with CF. Currently the Adult centre caters for approximately 160 adults and the Paediatric centre approximately 90 children with CF. The CUH Centre is the second largest centre in the country for patients with CF catering for the clinical needs of almost 25% of the entire CF population in Ireland. </p><p><b>Outpatient facilities</b></p><p>  In October 2011 a Cystic Fibrosis outpatient facility was opened which provides dedicated facilities which are state of the art.  This day care unit has the following facilities:</p><p>- Reception 7 waiting area</p><p>- Patient review rooms x 5</p><p>- Patient Gym</p><p>- Patient Facilities</p><p>- Staff Facilities </p><p>- Multidisciplinary team meeting room</p><p><b><i>In-patient Facilities</i></b></p><p>  The CUH Executive Management Board is committed to developing an Adult CF unit which will be incorporated into a new Respiratory ward.  The unit is to be provided in the main ward block of CUH.  CUH is in a unique position to progress this development with the support of local philanthropic support. 'Build 4 Life' (a support group for the development of capital resources in Adult CF for the CUH) have raised approximately &euro;2.2 million, including funding made available from my Department's allocation of National Lottery funding. In addition, enhanced paediatric CF facilities will be developed as part of the new paediatric unit.  The final design plans have been signed off by the project group and tender documentation has been collated and signed off.  It is proposed to issue the tender in the coming weeks the equipment list has been prepared and costed and the estimated completion date of the project is March 2014.</p></reply>

The payment is in addition to any other State payment the individual receives, such as the Disability Allowance.  RT programmes are operated by the HSE or on its behalf by specialist service providers. There are 2,800 (whole-time equivalent) RT places with approximately 3,000 people attending training programmes each year - some trainees attend on a part-basis. </p><p>  Participants are referred to training centres through the HSE&rsquo;s Occupational Guidance Services, and the range of programmes provided at training centres cater for people with intellectual disabilities, mental health disabilities, and those with physical and sensory disabilities. Rehabilitative programmes provide foundation level training which focuses on the development of an individual's life skills, social skills and basic work skills with the objective of enhancing the trainee's quality of life and general work capacity. </p><p>  There have been no cuts to the Rehabilitative Training (RT) allowance over the past three years and the rate of payment remains at &euro;31.80.   Payment is made on a pro-rata basis if the trainee attends on a part-time basis.  The trainee is entitled to the payment for the duration of their attendance at an RT course. The length of time which a trainee spends on an RT training course varies depending on the nature of the course and the trainees&rsquo; needs and abilities, but is typically from 2 to 4 years. </p></reply>

The HSE and service providers are working closely together to identify how the needs of all school-leavers can be met within available resources.</p><p>  The HSE has informed me that from September 2013, all 157 school-leavers in the Cork area will receive a full-time day service, which to me represents a significant achievement by the HSE in collaboration with service providers within the resources provided .  All funding allocated for school-leavers in the Cork area has been concentrated on securing a day service for these 157 individuals and I understand from the HSE that there is no scope to provide for additional transport costs.</p><p>  This was undoubtedly a hard decision for the HSE to take but one which they felt was necessary in order to protect essential services.</p></reply>

Licences issued prior to that date can be transferred only once. </p><p>  In line with the recommendation under Action 14 of the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011, Section 14 of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 provides for a prohibition on the transfer of all SPSV vehicle licences. The underlying principle for the prohibition on transfer is that a licence should determine a person&rsquo;s suitability to carry out a function and it should not have monetary value or be traded on the open market. </p><p>  Only in the exceptional circumstances of the event of the death of a licence holder will a taxi licence be permitted to continue in force, as provided for under Section 15 of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012. </p><p>  I intend to make a further amendment to the Taxi Bill to ensure the proportionate application of the legal provisions concerning the prohibition on transfer of a taxi licence to deal the matter of a company holding a taxi licence. </p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011 sets out the future approach to regulation of the taxi market. At the core of the Report are recommendations concerning stronger qualitative controls for SPSV licensing, improved standards and effective enforcement. The conclusion of the Taxi Review Group is that this approach is supported by the independent analysis of the economic consultants, Indecon, in particular that non-compliance with the taxi regulations is an impacting factor on the low level of exit from the taxi market.   </p><p>  There  are no plans for the introduction of a compensation scheme to facilitate licence holders wishing to leave the industry.</p></reply>
