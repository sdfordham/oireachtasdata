Overall, I am satisfied that we have made significant progress to date and that the benefits of these reforms will continue to accrue into the future.  The scale of reform that we have delivered could not have happened without the efforts and commitment of our public servants and I commend them for their contribution. </p></reply>

This Government has achieved this key target each year and, as outlined in the Spring Economic Statement (SES), Ireland is on track to exit the corrective arm of the SGP at the end of 2015 with a General Government Deficit of 2.3%. This is well below the limit of 2.9% under the Excessive Deficit Procedure.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 will therefore be framed under the rules that apply under the preventive arm of the SGP that will require Ireland to adhere to an adjustment path towards the Medium Term Objective (MTO). Until the MTO is reached, a minimum annual structural improvement of greater 0.5 per cent of GDP is required. Compliance with the preventive arm is also assessed by reference to the Expenditure Benchmark. The Expenditure Benchmark links the year on year growth in expenditure to the potential growth rate of the economy. </p>  <p>  As set out on page 34 of the SES, following discussions with the European Commission, there has been clarification on the application of the Expenditure Benchmark that is positive from an Irish perspective, with a marginal benefit in terms of fiscal space for 2016 equivalent to 0.4% of GDP.</p>  <p>  The SES outlined that fiscal space of the order of &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion is available for Budget 2016, which affords the scope to increase Government expenditure by &euro;750 million between 2015 and 2016.  </p>  <p>  Compliance with the fiscal rules under the preventive arm of the SGP, will ensure that Ireland's public finances are kept on a sustainable path, with  revenues sufficient to support spending. The challenge will remain to prioritise and design Government interventions within this framework.</p></reply>

For over a decade, the total allocation for these subheads has exceeded the amount available from the National Lottery. These subheads are described as being part-funded by the National Lottery and the balance of the expenditure allocation for the subheads comes from normal Exchequer sources (e.g. tax revenue or borrowing). All expenditure under these sub-heads, including that funded by the Lottery, counts towards the Government's expenditure ceiling in the year in question.</p><p>The 2013 Act provided for a new area the Natural Environment to be added to the list of categories that may be funded by the Lottery. It is open to relevant Departments (e.g. the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) to make a proposal to my Department for Lottery funding for a project or programme relevant to this new area. Should an application be received, it will be considered in the context of the level of funds available for Good Causes in the relevant year as well as the Government's overall expenditure ceiling. </p><p>While, to date, moneys from the National Lottery Fund have not been disbursed to this area, it is important to note that the Government already provides significant funding to the Environment Sector, e.g. the Environment Fund and through the Vote of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

This will allow the Government to encourage further economic growth, increase investment in public services, and reduce the tax burden for low and middle income earners.</p>  <p>  This 2016 budgetary approach reflects the strategy of Government to marry the objectives of encouraging economic growth while increasing the resources available to deliver quality public services. An approach that looks to create the right conditions for growth in employment through progressive taxation, appropriate regulation and targeted investment can ensure that there are sufficient resources available to deliver effective public services for our citizens. </p>  <p>  In relation to future years, decisions regarding the division of fiscal space between tax and expenditure measures will be taken in the relevant estimates cycle.

This will include &euro;6bn for investment in the national, regional and local road network.  It also involves &euro;3.6bn for Public Transport, including a new Metro link in Dublin.</p><p>Over the period 2016 to 2021, capital funding of almost &euro;3 billion will be provided in support of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, which aims to increase the supply of social housing by up to 35,000 units. </p><p>&euro;3.8 billion is being invested in Education which will enable us to continue to meet growing enrolments at primary and post-primary level, and also to invest in third level facilities. </p><p>Over &euro;3 billion is being invested in Health to deliver major infrastructural projects such as the new National Children's Hospital.</p><p>The Plan also announces the development of a new 3rd Phase of the Government's PPP programme with about &euro;500 million of PPP projects.</p><p>In addition, over the period of the Capital Plan, the wider State sector plans to invest &euro;14&frac12; billion in capital projects.  This will principally be undertaken by the commercial State-owned companies.  These will lead to about &euro;42 billion of State backed investment in capital projects.</p><p>The Exchequer funded Plan will support some 45,000 construction related jobs and protect our economic recovery and competitiveness.</p><p>It is a National programme that will also provide a commitment to rollout Broadband in rural areas, investment via the Rural Development Programme, and a new Village Renewal Scheme.  We will respond to climate change by investing more resources in energy efficiency, Forestry Programmes, increasing flood mitigation works.</p><p>We will also make investments in the Justice Sector including investment in necessary ICT infrastructure and in the Garda fleet to support Garda reform and deliver an effective and modern policing service. </p><p>The resources are targeted where infrastructural improvements are most required.  The plan has been designed to underpin and build on our economic recovery.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-01a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100100052#WRA01800"><p>The national platform for the management of tendering, eTenders, which is managed by the OGP, does not collect data relating to consortia or joint bids as part of the tendering process.  Directive 2014/24/EU published by Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) on February 26th 2014 which is yet to be transposed in to Irish Law, instructs that information on whether contracts are awarded to a group of economic operators (joint venture, consortium or other) is to be captured. It is intended that eTenders platform will have the capability to capture this data.</p><p>Since late 2013 the OGP has undertaken a significant business intelligence exercise to analyse the national state spend and tendering activities.  As the Deputy is aware, a ground-breaking report was published earlier this year by the OGP which analysed 2013 spend and tendering activity from 64 large public service bodies across thousands of account codes relating to almost 4 million payment transactions.  Over 35,000 suppliers were classified by size using data from Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet, Irish Times, eTenders, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and SoloCheck.ie.  However for the majority of businesses full data was not available and for the majority of likely &quot;micro&quot; businesses no data at all was publicly available.  Where no classification data was available (accounting for 14% of the spend data collected), these suppliers were excluded from the analysis. </p><p>Much effort has been made by the OGP to communicate with Suppliers asking them to update their business profiles in eTenders (the national tendering platform ) with accurate business profile data so it can expand and improve the classification methodology.  Until more data is available the OGP will not be able to report specifically on micro-enterprises. </p><p>The OGP consistently promotes the inclusion of SMEs in public tendering activities and as part of Circular 10/14 issued last year SMEs are encouraged to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has also issued guidance for companies in this regard.  Template tender and contract documents allow for consortia to tender for public procurement opportunities. </p><p>The OGP issued a report titled &quot;Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013&quot; and the positive news for Irish businesses and for SMEs is that the data indicates</p><p>-93% of public service expenditure is with businesses in the Republic of Ireland;</p><p>-66% of public service expenditure is with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), ranging from high levels of SME success in areas such as Plant Hire (98%), Laboratory and Diagnostic Equipment (87%) and Minor Building and Civils Works (85%) to low levels in areas such as Utilities (24%) and Medical, Surgical and Pharmaceutical Supplies (38%).</p></reply>

Targeted social clauses are likely to be most effective in cases where they are actively supported by supply-side actions and by good monitoring and evaluation processes taken by the Department or Agency with the relevant policy remit. The inclusion of social clauses represents additional costs to the State and suppliers in meeting the requirements and demonstrating and verifying compliance.  It is imperative that such provisions</p><p>-are enforced and independently verified;</p><p>-do not adversely affect value for money;</p><p>-do not place additional costs on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers, and;</p><p>-are only applied to contracts of a minimum scale so that they do not disadvantage SMEs.</p><p>Unemployment in the construction sector increased since the economic crisis first hit mirroring the decline in activity. In response, Government set out a range of actions in Construction 2020 aimed at increasing activity and has introduced a number of stimulus packages to increase activity and employment in the sector.  Social clauses are included in the various contracts that are awarded under the PPP element of the &euro;2.25bn package announced in July 2012.  These clauses require a minimum percentage of the time required to deliver the contract to be undertaken by those recruited from the ranks of the long term unemployed and apprentices.</p><p>The operation of this clause has already been successfully piloted and local Intreo offices have worked closely with the appointed contractors to support the pilot initiative.</p><p>The OGP is currently developing guidance for my consideration in including social clauses more broadly in tender and contract documentation. </p></reply>

These arrangements, which now apply to most Government departments, give managers the means to respond to service needs as they arise, including considerable flexibility to make staffing and service level delivery decisions at the front line.  </p><p>These new arrangements represent a significant shift away from the central control of the Moratorium and allow Departments greater management of its staffing resources.  </p></reply>

The National Shared Services Office (NSSO) within the Department is leading on shared service strategy and implementation within the overall Reform and Renewal context.  It is responsible for delivering Shared Services projects in the Civil Service and for the operation of Civil Service Shared Service Centres.  As part of its wider leadership role, the NSSO provides support to other Public Service sectors in progressing their Shared Service commitments but is not directly responsible for their implementation.  </p><p>My Department is advancing 3 key Shared Services projects across the Civil Service.  These are:</p><p><b>PeoplePoint, the HR and Pensions Administration Shared Service Centre; </b>PeoplePoint operates the Civil and Public Service HR and pensions administration service on behalf of 31 Public Service Bodies, serving approximately 26,500 employees currently. This will rise to more than 33,000 employees across 40 Public Service Bodies. <b>Payroll Shared Service Centre </b>The Payroll Shared Service Centre (PSSC) provides payroll and travel and subsistence services to 31,000 payees across 34 Public Service Bodies.  This will rise to 120,000 payees (including pension payees) across 53 Public Service Bodies.  <b>Financial Management Shared Service Project</b>The Financial Management Shared Service Project is at an earlier stage.  A procurement exercise is nearing completion for a single solution to deliver Financial Management Shared Services to approximately 47 Public Service Bodies.  Once the business case is fully evaluated, I expect to seek the approval of Government to progress to implementation.  Shared Services improves management insights to support more informed decision making at PSBs and across Central Government through standardising data sets and common information requirements and sharing of cost effective standard technology solutions.</p><p>- Shared Services allows Public Service Bodies have the right balance of retained knowledge and more strategicexpertise to focus on the core business of their Department.</p><p>- Shared Services frees up resources to support core Government services and priorities for front-line services, and creates harmonisation opportunities increasing policy complianceacross Departments and drives processing excellence, efficiency and scalability.</p><p>- Shared Services is not a short-term efficiency measure.  Both public and private sector best practice indicates that benefits are generally realised over three to five years following the transitioning of all customers into the new service.</p><p>- Over the medium term, Shared Services delivers effective and efficient corporate services through the adoption of standardised processes for repeatable transactions, thereby improving performance and reducing duplication of effort and avoidance of procuring expensive highly customised individual solutions in response to new and emerging requirements.</p><p>In September, I announced that the Government had approved the drafting of the National Shared Services Office Bill 2015 to establish the NSSO as a separate Civil Service Office, under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

For any public servant whose annualised salary is below &euro;24,001 there will be an increase in gross pay of 2.5% from 1 January 2016.  For those on annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 there will be an increase in gross pay of 1% from 1 January 2016.  For all those on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 there will be an increase in gross pay of &euro;1,000 from 1 September 2017. </p>  <p>  Additionally, all public servants will benefit from the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) measures contained in the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  On 1 January 2016 the exemption threshold for payment of Pension Related Deduction (PRD) will increase from &euro;15,000 per annum to &euro;24,750 per annum and on 1 September the exemption threshold for payment of Pension Related Deduction (PRD) will increase further from &euro;24,750 per annum to &euro;28,750 per annum.  The value of the PRD measures to individual public servants is &euro;733 per annum in 2016 increasing to &euro;1,000 in 2017 with lower paid public servants benefiting to a greater extent through the tax code.</p>  <p>  Following acceptance of the Lansdowne  Road Agreement by the Public Services Committee of the  Irish Congress of Trade Unions, my intention is to bring forward the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the Agreement shortly.</p></reply>

However, a small minority is not and a range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.</p>  <p>  The Department has set out its strategic approach to tackling fraud and error in the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy.  It includes systematic measures to prevent and detect fraud and to ensure effective debt recovery and deterrence measures are in place. As part of these measures, the Department is continuing to improve and utilise more innovative approaches to prevent and detect fraud.</p>  <p>  A key measure of control activity is the value of control savings achieved by the Department on an annual basis.  Control savings are an estimate of the value of various control activities across schemes in payment.  They represent the value of prevented expenditure over a future period that would have been incurred if investigative and control work had not been carried out.  In this context the Department undertakes a substantial number of control reviews each year.  In 2014 over 1m control reviews were carried out yielding control savings of &euro;505m, 99% of the overall target set for 2014.  A similar level of savings is expected in 2015.  In addition work is ongoing utilising predictive analytics techniques to identify non-compliance amongst existing customers of the three main working age schemes.  These predictive models will enable the Department to detect more non-compliant cases and to do so more efficiently. </p>  <p>  Furthermore the presence on the ground has been increased through the secondment of 20 Garda&iacute; to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit.  These officers are augmenting the resources and expertise available to the Department to detect and investigate fraud.</p>  <p>  Effective deterrence is also necessary to address fraud.  It is important to ensure appropriate sanctions can be applied where fraud is discovered.  Where an individual committing social welfare fraud thinks that the potential penalty or sanction is minimal, relative to the potential gain, then fraudulent activity will be encouraged and will most likely continue. </p>  <p>  The Department is proactively targeting persons with overpayments to ensure all persons who have a social welfare overpayment are making a contribution towards the repayment of the debt outstanding.  Enhanced debt recovery is being achieved through a new debt management system which went live in 2014.  &euro;83m in overpayments were recovered in 2014, &euro;8m more than the target set for the year and an increase of over 17% on the amount recovered in 2013 (&euro;71m approx.).  In addition over 315 cases were submitted for prosecution, which was in excess of the target set for last year.</p>  <p>  The overall aim of the Department&rsquo;s approach to tackling fraud and incorrect payments is to ensure that the available resources are targeted at, and are available for, the people, who need them most.</p></reply>

The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes. The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC. The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied. These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. </p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy is not compiled by my Department, and is not therefore available. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce a disregard in respect of parts of a person's insurance record to enable them to qualify for SPC.</p></reply>

Over 13,700 rent supplement tenancies have been awarded this year showing that significant numbers are being accommodated under the scheme.</p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.</p>  <p>  Analysis shows that increasing the current rent limits nationwide by 5% would result in a full year cost in excess of &euro;15 million, a 10% increase would carry a cost of almost &euro;37 million, with a 15% increase costing approximately &euro;51 million. A breakdown of this cost on a county basis is not available, however the costs to apply such an increase in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford regions, which accounts for over 58% of the customer base, would account for a significant proportion of this additional cost.  Though the costing model accurately reflects the increased cost for the scheme, the likelihood is that there will be little additional supply achieved for persons seeking rent supplement support due to the constrained market. There is also the additional risk in a market with such tight supply that rent supplement limits would generate homelessness for low income/single earner families who could no longer compete with the higher rents. </p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants.  Under this measure tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  This flexible approach has already assisted approximately 4,000 households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans to extend this arrangement to Galway City.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss these measures are implemented as appropriate.  Persons in receipt of rent supplement at risk of losing their tenancy are advised to contact the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service or Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service without delay.</p>  <p>  I am keeping this matter under close review.</p></reply>

In this respect therefore, I must have regard to economic and budgetary constraints, together with Ireland's obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact, in considering possible public financial contributions in the area of international climate finance. </p>  <p>  Against this background, an inter-Departmental technical working group has been established to actively consider and present feasible options for scaling-up/mobilisation of international climate finance in the period to 2020, including via the Green Climate Fund (GCF). This work includes consideration of both public and private finance options as well as policy instruments. A decision to contribute to the GCF and the size of any such contribution would, of course, require Government approval in the first instance and would fall to be implemented by the Minister for Finance if required.  </p>  <p>  As with Ireland's involvement with other International Institutions such as the World Bank and funds established by such Institutions, my officials will work closely with officials from other relevant Departments and Agencies to ensure a whole-of-Government approach is taken to meet our policy objectives and optimise outcomes for Ireland.  In this manner, it is envisaged that my officials would work closely with those from the Department of the Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government and other Departments/Agencies should any contribution be made by Ireland to the GCF.</p></reply>

Relief for contributions is granted to an employee against the remuneration from the employment in respect of which the pension scheme is effected. The relief is given by way of deduction of the pension contributions as an expense in determining the employee's income tax liability for the year in question. In any tax year, the amount of contributions on which relief can be granted is limited to an age-related percentage (ranging from 15% to 40%) of the employee's remuneration (subject to an overall annual earnings' cap, which currently stands at &euro;115,000).</p><p>Employee contributions can take the form of ordinary annual contributions, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) or special contributions. AVCs allow employees to improve the retirement benefits provided by their occupational pension scheme at their own expense (i.e. without a corresponding employer contribution)provided the benefits stay within Revenue maximum limits. A common circumstance in which special contributions arise is in the context of payments to AVC schemes at or near the point of retirement (known as &quot;last minute&quot; AVCs) to enhance benefits (normally the lump sum). Irrespective of the type of contribution (ordinary, AVC or special) overall relief on contributions in any year cannot exceed the relevant age- related percentage limit of earnings. </p><p>In the case of ordinary annual contributions (and regular additional voluntary contributions) relief is normally provided by an employer under what is known as the net pay arrangementwhereby employee pension contributions are deducted from gross pay before tax is calculated. In the case of special contributions, relief is normally granted by way of a claim made by the taxpayer to Revenue at the end of the relevant tax year. Any unrelieved special contributions made in a year can be carried forward and treated as a contribution made in future years for the purposes of tax relief (subject to the relevant limits applying for those years). This spreading forward continues until the full amount had been granted relief or until it is no longer possible to carry the relief forward.</p><p>The inability to carry relief forward would occur, for example, where the employee has retiredin which case, as the relief for pension contributions is only available against the remuneration in respect of which the pension scheme is effected, the retirement results in a cessation of the roll forward of relief.</p><p>In that regard, however, section 774 (8) of the TCA 1997 provides for a limited spread-back provision for special contributions whereby a contribution made before the return filing date for a year (generally 31 October) can, where the taxpayer so elects, be treated as having been made in the previous year with tax relief granted in that earlier year (subject to the relevant age-related and earnings limits applying in that earlier year).</p><p>This is particularly useful where an individual is close to retirement, as he or she may have insufficient taxable income in the year in which the contributions are paid (i.e. the year of retirement) to absorb the full amount of the special contribution. In addition, the carry forward of unrelieved contributions to later years is not an option for such individuals, as pension income is not taken into account in computing income for pension contribution tax relief purposes. This facility, therefore, effectively allows the retiree to use the tax relief available to him or her in the year of retirement and, where necessary, to take advantage of any unused tax relief in the previous year. </p><p>In recognition of the fact that retiring employees who are not chargeable persons (within the meaning of Part 41A TCA 1997) may overlook the 31 October deadline for making an election, Revenue, in such cases, treats an election as being timely where it is received on or before the 31 December of the year of retirement, once the special contribution has been made by the earlier of the return filing date (i.e. 31 October) and the date of retirement.</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF">[1]</font></i>The legislation only refers to ordinary annual contributions and contributions that are not ordinary annual contributions but the latter encompass AVCs and special contributions. AVCs can be made on a regular basis (like ordinary annual contributions) or on a once off or occasional basis in which case they are generally referred to as special contributions.</p></reply>

Alternatively, the estimated first and full year yields to the Exchequer of applying a comparable 3% USC surcharge to Pay As You Earn (PAYE) income over &euro;100,000 are in the order of &euro;84 million and &euro;108 million respectively.  The Deputy will be aware that other differences also exist in the treatment of employed and self-employed taxpayers, such as differences in expenses deduction regimes and the timing of tax payments.  In this regard, the PAYE and self-assessment systems are not directly comparable.</p><p>Regarding the question as to the cost of reducing the 11% rate of Universal Social Charge for non-Pay As You Earn income earners over &euro;100,000 to 10%; and to 9%, I am<b></b>informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated first and full year costs to the Exchequer of reducing the rate from 11% to 10% are in the order of &euro;20 million and &euro;48 million respectively. The estimated first and full year costs of reducing the rate from 11% to 9% are &euro;40 million and &euro;96 million respectively.</p><p>In relation to the question as to the number of persons who paid the 3% Universal Social Charge surcharge on earnings over &euro;100,000 in each year since 2011, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners this information is available for 2012 and 2013 on the Revenue Statistics webpage at .</p><p>In response to the question as to the cost of introducing an earned income tax credit for self-employed people of &euro;250; &euro;500; &euro;825; &euro;1,650, per annum the Revenue Commissioners estimate, on the basis of 2013 returns, the latest year for which data are available, introducing this credit would cost in the region of &euro;21 million, &euro;41 million, &euro;68 million and &euro;137 million respectively. For the purposes of this estimate, it is assumed that the credit would only be extended to cases identified to be in receipt of Trading or Professional (Case I or Case II) income, and not currently in receipt of the PAYE credit. The estimate does not take into account the ability of the credit to be fully absorbed.</p><p>Regarding the question of the cost of increasing the personal income tax credit by &euro;100; and by &euro;200, per annum; and the number of tax payers who would benefit, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year cost to the Exchequer would be of the order of &euro;219 million and &euro;436 million respectively. The number of income earners to benefit from the Deputy's proposal would be 1.4 million. The increase in the personal tax credits mentioned in the Deputy's Question is assumed to apply in similar measure to widowed persons tax credit and to include the normal consequential increases in the tax credit for lone parents and the married tax credit. It should also be noted that a married couple or civil partners who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</p><p>In relation to the question as to the cost of reducing the 7% rate of Universal Social Charge to 5.5%; and to 5%, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a Ready Reckoner is available on the Revenue Statistics webpage at .  This Pre-Budget 2016 Ready Reckoner shows a wide range of information including a number of indicative changes to USC rates and thresholds. While the Ready Reckoner does not show all of the specific costings requested by the Deputy, other changes can be estimated broadly on a pro-rata (or straight-line) basis with those displayed in the Reckoner.</p><p>All figures provided above are estimates for 2016 incomes from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2013, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are provisional and may be revised.</p></reply>

It should be noted that in 2014, the most recent year available, it is estimated that over 70 individuals claimed relief under the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) for investments at or near the limit of &euro;150,000. This does not take into account individuals who invest via a fund.</p><p>The Deputy should note that it is not possible to state the cost of permanently removing the EII from the High Earners restriction as the effect of including the scheme in the restriction is to delay the relief rather than disallow it. This means the effect of removing it from the restriction would only lead to a temporary cash flow gain which could be in the region of &euro;1 million each year from 2018. There would be no cash flow for earlier years as the scheme is not included in the restriction for investments before 1 January 2017.</p><p>The estimated cash flow cost of providing full Income Tax relief in the year of investment, rather than over two stages, as currently provided, would be in the region of &euro;7 million to &euro;10 million in the first year of introduction. The incentive does not provide relief from Universal Social Charge and Pay Related Social Insurance, so this has not been costed.</p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of statistical information is available on the Commissioners' Statistics web page: .  In particular, the tax expenditure section of the web page includes the cost of the scheme: .</p><p>Data in relation to the number of jobs supported will become available at a later stage. Under the terms of the scheme, relief in respect of 30% of the amount invested in a qualifying company is granted to the investor in the year of investment, while the balance is only due where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company at the end of the 3 year holding period or where evidence is provided that the company used the capital raised for expenditure on research and development. Claims for the balance of the relief will be due from 2015.</p><p>In relation to increasing the investment period to five years, it is not possible to accurately estimate the impact of the tax cost but presumably there would be a disincentive effect on investment in the scheme which would likely lower the tax cost.</p><p>The cost of increasing the &euro;10 million company investment lifetime limit to &euro;15 million, &euro;20 million and &euro;25 million would depend on the ability of companies to secure investment in excess of the existing scheme. No company has utilised the full limit of &euro;10 million so far.</p></reply>

Tax returns data available to the Commissioners do not in all cases clearly distinguish between disposals of business assets and non-business assets. Furthermore, it is not clear from the question what would be considered "entrepreneurial" gains and the Revenue Commissioners have no reliable data to make distinctions between gains on that basis. Subject to these caveats it is very tentatively estimated that the cost of introducing a &euro;10 m cap and 10% CGT rate for individuals could cost in excess of &euro;130 million in a full year. This assumes that the reduced rate would apply in respect of all quoted and unquoted shares, commercial property disposals by proprietary directors and self-employed individuals and also agricultural land disposals by farmers. This estimate assumes no behavioural impact. </p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners do not require rental income data to be returned in a manner which would enable commercial and private rental accommodation income to be separately identified.  Similarly, income from the categories of tenant in the Deputy's proposals and the current level of mortgage interest deduction specific to such lettings is not separately identified.</p><p>In this context, it should be noted that an increase in interest deductibility would only be of benefit to those landlords that have borrowings outstanding in respect of the purchase or improvement of the relevant property. This limits the potential of any measure to incentivise landlords to commit to rent certainty. In addition, rent certainty would not of itself solve the supply-side issues that are driving rent increases. I note that the ESRI in their Quarterly Economic Commentary, published yesterday, urge that in light of difficult past experience, extreme caution should be taken when any use of the tax system as a means of stimulating activity in the residential property market is being considered.</p><p>Significant administrative issues would also need to be addressed in the implementation of such a measure.  It should also be noted that any increase in the deduction allowed for interest could not be confined to areas experiencing specific accommodation shortfalls, such as the major urban centres, and this would significantly increase the deadweight cost of the measure.  Furthermore it is likely that the increased deductibility would have to be applied in respect of taxable rental income sourced throughout the EU/EEA, where similar conditions are met.</p><p>With regard to the calculation of rental profits under current legislation, I would point out that there are also a number of other allowances and deductions available to reduce the tax on rental income paid. These include, for example, the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant and the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property.</p><p>In addition, wear and tear allowances are available in respect of expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the 2013 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General contained, in Chapter 16, a detailed review of the taxation of rental income and expenses deductible therefrom.  This report is available on the website of the Comptroller and Auditor General: .</p></reply>

During this time, it would be expected that approx 11,500 / 12,500 visitors would land on the Island when weather permits.</p>  <p>  From time to time, in the normal course of events, steps leading to the Monastery at Skellig Michael may become slightly loosened through the actions of nesting birds or by the passage of human feet.  These incidents are a regular occurrence throughout the summer and, because of their particular implications for safety, are closely monitored by the OPW guides and maintenance staff who remain onsite during the season.  As occurrences are observed therefore, they are dealt with as soon as the area is clear of visitors.  This does not involve introduction of new material but rather concerns the tightening up of steps which may have loosened by re-using the dislodged fabric.  Work of this nature was carried out in the week ending Friday 19th September.</p>  <p>  A second repair was also necessary recently at an entry point through a wall near to the Monastery.  An incident had occurred at this location in approx mid June when stones in the drystone entrance jamb at the entrance point were accidentally dislodged by visitors.  At the time, a repair was effected by the onsite OPW staff and the damage was rectified.  The same material was again inadvertently dislodged by a visitor passing through the entrance on 17 September.  The entrance was immediately protected and access curtailed while a repair was carried out by OPW stonemason staff onsite.  The work took a short time to complete and normal access through the entrance was restored immediately thereafter.</p></reply>

The Exhibition will run for 4 weeks and the above documents will be on public display at a venue in Crossmolina (yet to be decided), along with a duplicate set being made available in the Council offices in Castlebar. In addition, on a number of days and evenings during the exhibition, OPW staff and consultants will be in attendance to answer queries and take comments on the scheme. </p>  <p>  Following the exhibition period, a further minimum period of 4 weeks will be allowed for the receipt of comments and observations from interested parties, which will be given due consideration by the OPW, with the scheme being amended if appropriate. Following this, the detailed design of the Scheme will be undertaken which will allow the relevant documentation to be prepared to apply for formal Confirmation of the scheme under the Arterial Drainage Acts by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, hopefully during the second quarter of 2016. </p>  <p>  As part of the Confirmation process, the Minister will be required, as a result of EU environmental regulations, to have an independent assessment of the Environmental Impact Statement carried out.  Every effort will be made to bring the Scheme to construction stage before end 2016 but it may be 2017 before construction commences.</p>  <p>  The OPW remains fully committed to the Scheme and has provided for its costs in its multi annual budget profiles for 2016-2018.</p></reply>

This resulted in a successful exit from the programme in December 2013.</p>  <p>  As a result of the fiscal policies of this Government and the efforts of the Irish people, Budget 2015 marked a turning point where expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets and the Government could look to making targeted increases in expenditure for key sectors.  </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Spring Economic Statement (SES), Ireland is on track to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) at the end of 2015 with a General Government Deficit of 2.3%. With Ireland moving to the preventive arm of the SGP, the SES outlined that fiscal space of the order of &euro;1.2 to &euro;1.5 billion would be available for Budget 2016 split evenly between expenditure increases and tax reductions. This will allow the Government to target prudent increases in expenditure of up to &euro;750 million in 2016 relative to the 2015 spend.  The specific measures will be announced on Budget day.</p>  <p>  Public service reform remains at the heart of this Government's agenda and focuses on ensuring efficiency and improving outcomes for service users - that is, every citizen in the country. Investment in public services will continue to be targeted at priority areas and will be linked closely with reform. Importantly, the cost savings delivered through the reform programme are available for priority front-line services. Furthermore, the wide-ranging reforms to the budgetary architecture introduced by this Government support the efficient use of public funds to deliver effective services for citizens. The implementation of a medium term budgetary framework and the introduction of wide-scale reviews of public expenditure with the Comprehensive Reviews of Expenditure allow for greater consideration and debate about key challenges facing public expenditure. In this regard, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) is an integrated cross-Government service which enhances the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy making.  IGEES staff operate in designated economic evaluation units and are engaged with almost all Government Departments.</p>  <p>  Specific measures for Housing and Health are contained in the recently published Capital Investment Framework. Social Housing was identified as a critical area for investment, and over the period 2016 to 2021 capital funding of almost &euro;3 billion will be provided in support of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, which aims to increase the supply of social housing by up to 35,000 units.  Furthermore, over &euro;3 billion is being invested in Health.  This will deliver major infrastructural projects such as the new National Children's Hospital, which will be the largest health infrastructure project ever undertaken in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Building on this Government's track record, Budget 2016 will set out a responsible, affordable and sustainable way forward for expenditure.</p></reply>

If a private Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to fund social and affordable housing can be developed in that context, it could possibly involve the SPV issuing its own bonds to fund housing.  </p></reply>

IDA Ireland is aware, however, of the availability of this property and has included it on its property database of available office and manufacturing properties in Co. Kerry.  This database is used to identify possible properties which might be suited to potential client needs.  In County Kerry as a whole there are 12 IDA Ireland client companies employing 1,874 people in full and part time employment.</p><p>We are determined that every region will benefit from the recovery.  Growing both Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and indigenous enterprise is key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  In February, the Government announced details of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs: Regional</i>initiative which seeks to capitalise on the strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation.  The initiative will build on the success of the National Action Plan for Jobs, and encourage regional stakeholders - including enterprise agencies, Local Authorities, higher education institutions, other public bodies and the private sector - to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their own region.</p><p>In addition to a &euro;150 million property investment programme for the IDA, up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support entrepreneurs and enterprise growth in the regions.  Three new competitive calls will be announced this year by Enterprise Ireland at regional level.  The first will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives, the second will focus on new ideas emerging from the LEOs and a third, broader, competitive regional call will support significant projects or initiatives to improve or leverage identified enterprise capability in the region.</p><p>Kerry has traditionally established itself as a centre for foreign manufacturing companies but has seen a number of downsizings/closures in recent years.  It has however attracted a number of services companies (e.g. JRI America, Enercon, etc.) and has a strong cluster of well-established indigenous companies.</p><p>Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, officials of my Department and its agencies are actively engaged with regional stakeholders in the development of individual Action Plans for each of the regions, including the South West Region, which was launched on 3 July 2015.  Counties Kerry and Cork make up the South West Region.</p></reply>

The Teagasc Green Cert course has been developed to meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers.  The course covers subjects such as the environment, farm safety and animal welfare as well as modules dealing with production agriculture, farm business management and succession.  It is offered at Teagasc Regional Education Centres and Agricultural Colleges as a distance learning option.  It is Teagasc policy to accommodate all farmers that require places on the Green Cert course.  Interest is currently exceptionally high due to the education requirements of the Young Farmers Scheme and the National Reserve.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, approved the appointment of 20 temporary teachers in 2014 to meet the Green Cert demand.  It enabled Teagasc to substantially increase intake from a normal level of 500 annually to 1,500 enrolees, a threefold increase. Teagasc was recently granted approval to hire a further 20 temporary teachers bringing the overall allocation to date to 40. It will enable Teagasc to provide an additional 1,000 Green cert places this autumn.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with Teagasc to explore all available options to maximise participation in the Green Cert.</p></reply>

This inspection is currently being finalised with the intention of issuing any payment due under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme as soon as possible. In the event that any queries arise officials in my Department will be in contact with the person named.</p></reply>

My Department has no pending court cases against dog breeders. There are 68 dog registered breeding establishments in Ireland, 58 of which were inspected jointly by my Department and local authorities during 2015.  On average 200 dogs have been exported to the United Kingdom per week since the beginning of 2015.</p>  <p>  With regard to pets, in accordance with EU law, all pets entering and leaving Ireland must have a valid rabies vaccination evidenced by a pet passport or a veterinary health certificate. The special derogation from a rabies vaccination that was in place in respect of movement of pets between Ireland and the United Kingdom expired on 1 January 2012 and the rabies rules on pet movement within the EU are applied uniformly across the EU.</p>  <p>  With effect from 29 December 2014, when Regulation (EU) No 576/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council came into operation, dogs must be a minimum of 12 weeks old before a rabies vaccine can be administered. The immunity takes effect 21 days after vaccination, which means that, in fact, pups must be a minimum of 15 weeks of age before they are eligible to travel between Member States of the EU. This new minimum age requirement is based on the veterinary and scientific advice that an animal less than 3 months old may be too young to effectively vaccinate against rabies.</p></reply>

In relation to the Basic Payment Scheme and Greening Payment, I am pleased to confirm that advance payments will commence to issue in Ireland on 16 October 2015, which is the earliest that payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations. In addition, following my direct approach to the EU Agriculture Commissioner, I can confirm that the level of the advance payment is set at 70% for 2015 rather than the normal 50%. The increase in the advance payment for 2015 is, in particular, due to the difficulties encountered in the dairying and pigmeat sectors. Payments under the Basic Payment and Greening Scheme will be made to all applicants, whose applications are fully processed and who have no outstanding errors from 16 October 2015.  Processing of the application under the ANC Scheme is currently in progress. On completion of this process, the application will be further reviewed with a view to payment issuing directly to the nominated bank account of the person named at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

Dogs which end up in the dog pound system may be more likely to have been poorly cared for and poorly socialised and so are more likely to be dangerous and present a risk, particularly to children.</p></reply>

Once all the details have been verified, the applicant is referred to the Army Pensions Board for examination. The Army Pensions Board is a statutory independent Board appointed to investigate disability applications under the Army Pensions Acts and to report to the Minister thereon. The convening of the Board is subject to the availability of the members and the Board deals with all disability pension applications in chronological order.  As outlined previously in relation to this case, my Department expects to be in a position to write to the applicant in the near future and advise of the decision regarding his application.</p></reply>

The Government has given a firm commitment to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and intends to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has a dualist legal system and therefore does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary. We are determined to take the steps necessary to meet all the Convention's requirements in a constructive, proactive and appropriate manner. I should stress that for Ireland, ratification is the end of the preparation and implementation phase, not the beginning.</p>  <p>  A team within my Department has been charged with examining all outstanding obstacles to ratification, and has nearly completed the first phase of its work, which includes identifying all areas which will need attention to make ratification possible. My Department chairs the Interdepartmental Committee, which comprises representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Children and Youth Affairs; Finance; Education and Skills; Health; Defence; Environment, Community and Local Government; Public Expenditure and Reform; Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; Social Protection; and the Office of Public Works.  </p>  <p>  Significant progress towards ratification continues to be made and much has been accomplished.  The requirement to enact suitable capacity legislation has long been one of the core obstacles to ratification of the Convention and the progress made in this area is a testament to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the obligations of the CRPD in a comprehensive and meaningful way. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 passed D&aacute;il Committee Stage on 17 June 2015 and enactment is expected by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Progress is also being made on necessary reforms to legislation on sexual offences, and by my colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State for Primary and Social Care, on reforms to mental health legislation.  Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  Further measures required to enable ratification include amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in existing legislation. </p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Committee has agreed on the main areas across Departments where legislative amendment or new legislation will be necessary to meet the requirements of the Convention. These proposals will be contained in a Roadmap to Ratification, which will be submitted to Government shortly.  Once approved by Government, we will publish the Roadmap outlining the measures to be taken to overcome all outstanding barriers to ratification of UN CRPD, along with the estimated timescales involved.</p></reply>

In order for a prisoner to be granted enhanced remission, I as Minister must be satisfied that the prisoner, having regard to the matters listed below, is less likely to re-offend and is better able to re-integrate into the community<i>.  </i>For all applications, the following factors are considered:</p><p>-the manner and extent to which the prisoner has engaged constructively in authorised structured activity</p><p>-the manner and extent to which the prisoner has taken steps to address his or offending behaviour</p><p>-the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the prisoner relates</p><p>-the sentence of imprisonment concerned and any recommendations of the court that imposed that sentence in relation thereto</p><p>-the period of the sentence served by the prisoner</p><p>-the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public (including the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the prisoner relates) should the prisoner be released from prison</p><p>-any offence of which the prisoner was convicted before being convicted of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by him or relates</p><p>-the conduct of the prisoner while in custody or during a period of temporary release</p><p>-any report of, or recommendation made by the Governor of the prison, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, any probation officer or any other person whom I consider would be of assistance in enabling me to make a decision on an application.</p><p>The statistics for those who applied for and were granted enhanced remission are not readily available and I will respond to the Deputy as soon as possible with the information requested.</p></reply>

The provisions of the Convention and the legislative and administrative arrangements that would enable Ireland to ratify the Convention have been identified following consultations with Government Departments and agencies. I intend to include those actions in the new National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. I expect to publish the  Strategy, which will cover a multi-year period from 2015, in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Current Irish legislation already implements many articles contained in the Convention. The EU Victims Directive which sets out minimum standards across the European Union on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime will also implement articles contained in the Convention. Legislation to give effect to the EU Directive is currently being drafted.</p>  <p>  A general scheme of a Domestic Violence Bill was published by my Department on 24th July, 2015. This legislation will enhance the legislative measures available within the civil law system to support and protect victims. The Bill, when enacted, will also introduce reforms required to enable Ireland to ratify the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  In addition, other legislative reform will implement elements of the Istanbul Convention. These include the recently published Sexual Offences Bill, the Court of Appeal Act, 2015 and the Children and Family Relationships Act, 2015.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 31 July 2015 the latest date for which figures are readily available, 681 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West, of which 86, 70 and 89 are stationed in Clondalkin, Lucan, and Ronanstown Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations, respectively.  The work of these Garda&iacute; is supported by 29 Garda Reserve members and 21 civilian staff. The work of local Garda&iacute; in the DMR West is   augmented when necessary by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Organised criminal activity is currently being targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across a number of fronts, including the use of focused intelligence-led operations by specialist units such as the Drugs and Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to the ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute;, and to this end the first intake since 2009 of new recruits commenced training at the Garda College, Templemore, in September of last year. To date there has been four intakes of Garda Trainees into the Garda College, giving a total intake of 400.  A further 150 recruits will enter college by year end, bringing total recruitment of Garda Trainees to 550.  So far 290 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   On attestation, new Probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are assigned to mainstream uniform  policing duties. I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

A standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating childcare services.  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week is paid per eligible child to services with more highly qualified staff.  This capitation rate is paid on the basis of a child attending for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week for 38 weeks.  Where a child attends for less hours, payment is made on a pro-rata basis.</p>  <p>  Payment is made based on the details provided by the childcare service when registering children.  The ECCE programme rules are clear that any change in level of service must be notified/administered on the system.  It is unfortunate that this service has lost out; however it is the responsibility of the service to manage its childcare arrangements with the parent and therefore to approach the parent in relation to the change in level of service in a timely manner.</p></reply>

The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures were debated in detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. The JOCH report was published in June 2015.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  The Bill is due to be published in the autumn. </p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol. The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices. MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.</p>  <p>  The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences. On the other hand, the study found that a ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.</p></reply>

The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship. The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will also provide for the making of regulations to restrict promotions including price based promotions.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures were debated in detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The JOCH report was published in June 2015.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  The Bill is due to be published in the autumn. </p>  <p>  The opinion of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice on minimum unit pricing (MUP) for alcohol products was published on the 3 September 2015.  The opinion indicates that minimum unit pricing may be compatible with European Law if it can be shown to be more effective than other alternative measures.  The Department of Health will study the opinion and its implications before the final judgement of the Court.  This is expected towards the end of the year.</p></reply>

In January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, the Minister for Health put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end. The HSE was provided with additional funding of &euro;51m to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved. </p>  <p>  In June, the HSE reported a performance against the 18 month maxima of 99.6% for in-patient/day cases (IP/DC) and 92% for out-patients (OPD). In order to maintain progress and to make further improvements to achieve a 15 month maxima by end December, the HSE has directed that hospitals which breach the 18 month maximum waiting time in August are to be fined.

In January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, the Minister for Health put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end. The HSE was provided with additional funding of &euro;51m to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved. </p>  <p>  In June, the HSE reported a performance against the 18 month maxima of 99.6% for in-patient/day cases (IP/DC) and 92% for out-patients (OPD). In order to maintain progress and to make further improvements to achieve a 15 month maxima by end December, the HSE has directed that hospitals which breach the 18 month maximum waiting time in August are to be fined. The fines will be calculated on the basis of the Activity Based Funding cost of each procedure and are being imposed from 1 September.</p>  <p>  The HSE, in conjunction with Hospital Groups is focused on delivering these targets through maximising use of internal capacity within and across Hospital Groups in the first instance.

However, I am not in a position to contribute to the funding of this study.  My Department's policy role in relation to sexual abuse and violence has been much reduced since the original study was undertaken.  The setting up of the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (COSC), under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality saw Government delegate explicit whole-of-government co-ordination to this Office.  More recently, responsibility for child protection, rape crisis services and refugees transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I consider that decision making, funding and oversight for the proposed study should be determined by the Department of Justice and Equality/COSC.  In so far as wider input is justified, this might have regard to the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for important matters formerly falling within this Department's remit.</p></reply>

The Summit saw the largest number of heads of state and government in the history of the UN gather to adopt the new framework, the 2030 Agenda, which will guide the actions of all countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger and achieve sustainable development over the next fifteen years.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach led the Irish delegation on the opening day of the Summit and President Higgins and my colleague Minister of State Sherlock also participated.</p>  <p>  Ireland led by Ambassador David Donoghue and Kenya co-facilitated the final phase of negotiations to agree this new development framework and succeeded in brokering consensus among all 193 Member States of the UN on this wide ranging global agenda. Last week was a proud moment for Ireland and our achievement in helping deliver this historic agreement was widely acknowledged.</p>  <p>  The 2030 Agenda is the second of three major agreements that will be concluded this year and which, taken together, have the potential to deliver a truly transformative agenda that can end poverty and promote sustainable development. The first of these is the Addis Ababa Accord on the means of implementing the new SDGs which was agreed in July, and the third, the climate agreement, should be concluded in Paris in December. </p>  <p>  The new SDGs are challenging and ambitious but we have been heartened by the level of commitment to their implementation expressed by global political leaders at last weekend&rsquo;s Summit.  The Taoiseach emphasised the importance Ireland attaches to these new goals and to their implementation.</p>  <p>  I am determined that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme which is central to our foreign policy will continue to focus on ending poverty in the poorest countries in the world.  The SDGs are universally applicable and all countries will have to take action.  Like our EU partners, we will now focus on developing the most appropriate institutional framework to deliver the 2030 Agenda at home and abroad.</p></reply>

We have stated clearly that we intend to make further progress on this commitment as our economic recovery consolidates.  The Taoiseach repeated the commitment when he addressed the United Nations in New York last week at the Summit to adopt the new framework for global development, the 2030 Agenda.  Ireland played an important role in ensuring that the EU recommitted to achieving the 0.7% target within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda.</p>  <p>  Over the lifetime of this Government, despite the severe economic difficulty we have faced, we have successfully managed to stabilise allocations to the aid programme.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2015/16 school year are set out in Department Circular 0005/2015 which is available on my Department's website.  The Deputy will be aware that I announced some improvements in the staffing schedule for small primary schools in February 2015.  These changes were introduced to better support the sustainability of small schools and particularly those in isolated areas and were the only changes that I made to the staffing arrangements for schools for the 2015/16 school year.</p><p>  These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools. </p><p>  These improvements particularly recognise the challenges faced by very small schools that are more than 8km from the next nearest school of the same type.  </p><p>  This package of measures will provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools, recognising the essential social function which small schools can play, especially in isolated communities.</p><p>  The Deputy has sought information on what the impact of these improvements would be for the 2014/15 school year if they were applicable to the last school year.  The improvements came into effect from 1 September 2015.  There is no scope within my Department to do the detailed analysis requested by the Deputy in relation to the 2014/15 school year given that the focus is now on the staffing and redeployment arrangements for the coming school year. </p></reply>

Principal duties in small to medium sized schools are carried out by teaching principals. </p><p>  Circular 25/02 which is available on the Department website outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.  Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.  Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school. </p><p>  The level of substitution required to facilitate doubling release time for teaching principals is estimated to be of the equivalent of about 170 posts.  </p><p>  I am aware of the workload issue and the pressures on Principals teachers.  My Department has done work at helping to ease the administrative burden on school principals.  The development and introduction of the primary online database is a significant step forward in this regard.  A further step forward was the publication recently of Department Circular 0033/2015 which updates and simplifies the manner in which primary schools can maintain pupil enrolment and attendance records following the introduction of the primary online database. </p><p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector.  They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.  </p><p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.</p><p>Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. This process has been embedded by NEPS psychologists in the Primary sector with the production by the Department of Special Educational Needs &ndash; A Continuum of Support guidance and resource materials which has been distributed to all schools since 2007/8. In late 2010 similar support documentation was produced in relation to Emotional and Behavioural difficulties in the Primary sector and in relation to a formal Post-Primary Continuum process.</p><p>The continua described above all involve a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools processes which moves from basic classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions and comprise three distinct school based phases characterised as follows:</p><blockquote>Classroom Support &ndash; is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom,<br /><br />School Support - is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher. Interventions at this stage will be additional to those provided through classroom support.<br /><br />School Support Plus &ndash; is generally characterised by the school requesting the involvement by the relevant external service (predominantly NEPS) in more detailed assessment and development of intervention programmes. This level of intervention is for children with complex and/or enduring needs and whose progress is considered inadequate, despite carefully planned interventions at previous levels. </blockquote><p>The staged model recognises that pupils present with a wide range of issues and difficulties and allows for their amelioration and intervention at the level most appropriate to the particular need. The continuum approach ensures that pupils presenting within this range are dealt with quickly and at the appropriate level without the establishment of a waiting list for formal assessment.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.  Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school.</p><p>Improving these arrangements so as to enable teaching principals to have one release day per week would cost of the order of &euro;10 million per annum.  </p><p>  I am aware of the workload issue and the pressures on Principals teachers.  My Department has done work at helping to ease the administrative burden on school principals.  The development and introduction of the primary online database is a significant step forward in this regard.

Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.  </p><p>The budget measure that required schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation was introduced as an alternative to an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule.  Such an adjustment would be the equivalent of an 0.6 change in the staffing schedule.  My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations so that it is based on a ratio of 18.25:1 compared to the standard 19:1 &ndash; an improvement of 0.75 on the standard staffing schedule for these schools.</p><p>  The net reduction in guidance provision as a consequence of this budget measure was of the order of 500 posts.  The annual budget saving from this measure is over &euro;30 million.  This gives an indication of the cost involved if this budget measure was not in place.  The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.  This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.  </p><p>  I have no plans to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools.  If economic recovery continues I hope the Government will be in a position to improve the standard staffing allocation to schools.  However, I believe that it is desirable to give schools discretion on how to use those increased resources.</p></reply>

A decision in Budget 2012 has meant that new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards are not entitled to maintenance payments under the Student Grant Scheme, but may qualify in some circumstances for limited fee support.</p><p>  Those who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of their fees.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it in accordance with a water charges plan to be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  Section 22(5) of the Act provides that a water charges plan may provide for charges in respect of the provision of a service connection (within the meaning of the Water Services Act 2007) to, or in respect of, a premises.

Although Tipperary County Council is now the amalgamation of North Tipperary County Council and South Tipperary County Council, including Clonmel Borough Council, all of these entities were still in place as of 31st December 2013 and as such the various fees at that date still apply.  Irish Water has informed my Department that there is not a single set fee for either a water or wastewater connection in Tipperary and the calculation for each composite connection charge (connection works fees plus development contribution fees) is calculated separately, depending on the location of the connection.</p><p>The CER published, in its Water Charges Plan Decision Paper of 5 March 2015, the areas that it will be progressing in 2015, which includes the development of Connection Charging Policy.  Later this year, the CER intend to publish an Information Paper which will include a high level work plan relating to the CER&rsquo;s approach to consulting on Irish Water&rsquo;s Connection Charging Policy.</p><p>In so far as the fees charged in relation to a particular property are concerned, Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The Local Improvement Scheme remains in place but there is no separate allocation available towards this grant category.  Instead local authorities may use up to 15% of their initial Discretionary Grant towards Local Improvement Schemes should they wish to do so.

No. 477 of 2006), the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of the National Car Testing Service (NCTS). </p>  <p>  The recent Volkswagen disclosure relates to laboratory pollution emission testing during the Type Approval Testing procedure.  The disclosure applies solely to emitted pollutants, centred primarily on nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the level of NOx emissions is not tested as part of the NCT current testing regime as it is not part of the criteria that is specified under the European Roadworthiness Directive.  The results of NCT tests by make and model of vehicle for 2013 and 2014 are available on the RSA website.</p>  <p>  This is a new and emerging issue and my Department is working closely with other Departments and Agencies in monitoring developments as the matter evolves, to fully understand the impact of this disclosure on the Irish market.  The situation relating to car emission controls is to be discussed today by the relevant Member State Ministers at a meeting of the European Competitiveness Council, the outcome of which is awaited.</p></reply>

This measure was introduced under the 2002 Act in tandem with the power of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to issue fixed charge notices. </p><p>The fixed charge notice system has proven very effective as a tool for enforcement and deterrence.  It also has the advantage, to both the public and the courts, of providing a means by which many of the cases can be resolved without recourse to the courts, with the inevitable added cost and burden to the courts which this would involve.</p><p>Fixed charge notices, whether issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by traffic wardens, allow a 28 day period in which the fixed charge penalty may be paid, after which the person has a further 28 days to pay the original penalty plus 50%.  Where the penalty has not been paid within 56 days, a prosecution for the offence can be initiated.  If payment is made within the 56 day period, there is no prosecution.</p><p>In cases where people wish to offer a defence regarding the alleged offence, they have the option to refuse to pay, and defend the case in court.</p><p>I see no reason to change this system in the manner proposed by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The wider objective is to help stall and, ultimately, reverse the trend towards depopulation, loss of vibrancy, vacancy and dereliction which currently exists.  During 2013 and 2014, the Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Heritage Council and three local authorities, ran a pilot HTI programme in Youghal, Listowel and Westport.  Central to the programme was that it was driven at local level, with guidance by a national steering group comprising officials from each local authority, DAHG, the Heritage Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  An HTI guidance manual was also developed to assist each town in the pilot programme.  The pilot scheme is considered to have been a success in the three towns that participated.  Plans to further develop the Initiative will be contingent on the availability of funding in the context of the many competing priorities in 2016 and beyond for the conservation, preservation and presentation of the State&rsquo;s heritage.</p></reply>
