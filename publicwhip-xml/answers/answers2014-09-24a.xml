Coroners are drawn from both the legal and medical professions and are of course very aware of the importance of dealing with bereaved families in a sensitive, humane and caring manner.<br/><br/>My understanding is that the remuneration for a coroner is made up of a basic retainer, which varies according to the case load and is intended to cover, for example, on-call duty and office expenses.  A fee per case is also paid in relation to work carried out on the following basis:<br/><br/>Death reported&euro;129.68 <br/><br/>Death certified following post mortem&euro;188.54 <br/><br/>Death certified following post mortem and inquest&euro;522.97  <br/><br/>The number of cases in each category for the coroners in Tipperary for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 are available on the coroner service website and I am setting these out along with details of the associated payments in the table below. <br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, the Coroners Bill 2007, which has been restored to the Order Paper, provides for a comprehensive reform of the law, practice and structures in regard to the coroner service.  The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department and in that context all governance and administrative matters in relation to coroners will be examined to determine how reform can be achieved in a cost effective manner.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br/><br/>Table 1<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Tipperary North</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>Death Report only</td><td>&euro;22,564.32</td><td>&euro;19,711.36</td><td>&euro;22,175.28</td></tr><tr><td>Death Report  and PM</td><td>&euro;8,107.22</td><td>&euro;5,467.66</td><td>&euro;4,147.88</td></tr><tr><td>Report and PM and Inquest</td><td>&euro;1,045.94</td><td>&euro;1,568.91</td><td>&euro;6,275.64</td></tr><tr><td>Retainer</td><td>&euro;21,774</td><td>&euro;21,774</td><td>&euro;21,774</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>&euro;53,491.48</td><td>&euro;48,521.93</td><td>&euro;54,372.80</td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Tipperary South</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>Death Report only</td><td>&euro;23,083.04</td><td>&euro;23,601.76</td><td>&euro;29,826.40</td></tr><tr><td>Death Report +P.M.</td><td>&euro;14,140.50</td><td>&euro;16,214.44</td><td>&euro;16,780.06</td></tr><tr><td>Report + P.M. + Inquest</td><td>&euro;16,735.04</td><td>&euro;20,918.80</td><td>&euro;13,597.22</td></tr><tr><td>Retainer</td><td>&euro;21,774</td><td>&euro;21,774</td><td>&euro;21,774</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>&euro;75,732.58</td><td>&euro;82,509</td><td>&euro;81,977.68</td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.  Currently, 4,330 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA.  The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly in recent years.  The current figure of 4,330 compared to the numbers residing in direct provision at its highest point in April, 2005 (8,080), shows that there has been a reduction of 46%, or 3,750 persons, in the intervening period.  The decline in numbers seeking accommodation is matched by a decline in the number of accommodation centres needed.  For example, in the period 2009 to date, RIA has reduced its accommodation portfolio from 60 centres to 34.  The last centre closed was Cliffview in Donegal town in July, 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware from my answer to Question 35740/14 today as to how the Government intends to give effect to the commitment in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 in relation to the protection process, including direct provision.</p><p>  The intention in prioritising the International Protection Bill is to reduce the length of time an applicant spends in the protection system through the establishment of a single applications procedure.  It would also be my intention that that issue of the length of time that persons spend in direct provision would be addressed by the Working Group which is being established. </p><p>  The intention more generally will be to focus on achieving improvements in the direct provision system as it currently operates which will  bring real benefits to those living there.</p></reply>

Since I took up office in the Department, I have been provided with an outline proposal from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre in regard to the necessary work.</p><p>  I have also met with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre&rsquo;s Chief Executive, Ms. Ellen O&rsquo;Malley-Dunlop along with  the principal researcher who undertook the original  study, Prof. Hannah McGee and had a very good exchange of views as to the value and feasibility of undertaking this particular project at this time.  I requested a further more detailed proposal and I have, very recently, received a copy of that proposal which is now being examined by officials in my Department.</p><p>  As the estimate for the cost of the work involved is quite substantial, the initial proposal suggested part-funding of the project across four Government Departments.  I was persuaded that there is a value to the proposed research and I have been in correspondence with the relevant Ministers requesting that they consider the possibilities of part-funding the project. </p><p>  I will further consider the proposal following receipt of the views of my Cabinet colleagues. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-24a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092400069#WRA01700"><p>It is unfortunately the case that gun crime has for some time been an inherent part of organised criminal activity in Ireland, as it is in other similar jurisdictions.  This demands a robust response, and this is precisely what is happening.  Garda&iacute; tackle this type of crime through a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  Shortly after taking up office I discussed the challenges presented by this type of crime with the Acting Garda Commissioner, who outlined the substantial efforts being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and target those involved.</p><p>  A range of operations are in place to target and confront armed and organised criminals, including Operation Domino and Operation Hybrid in the Dublin area.  In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also engages extensively with communities in a range of fora to address local concerns relating to crime and community safety, including the impact that organised crime can have at a community level.</p><p>  Heavy penalties are provided for weapons offences in our criminal law and mandatory minimum penalties have been introduced for certain firearms offences.  The considerable powers already available to Garda&iacute; have been supplemented further by the recent DNA Database legislation which provides for the establishment of a Database which will have the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist Garda&iacute; in investigating a whole range serious offences. </p><p>  I am not convinced at this stage that some form of firearms amnesty would make a useful contribution to the reduction of gun crime.  There was such an arrangement for a two month period in late 2006 but that was in the context of new licensing arrangements being introduced and represented an opportunity for people to regularise their situation before the heavier penalties provided for in the legislation came into force.  It is doubtful that such an amnesty would result in hardened criminals handing up weapons.  Equally, I am not sure it is desirable to allow people who hold firearms illegally to evade the legal consequences for that.  Nevertheless, I will keep this matter under review.</p><p>  What I believe is very important is that we have robust legislation in place in relation to firearms.  In that context, in view of public safety concerns raised by the Garda Commissioner, a joint Review of operational, legislative and administrative issues governing firearms licensing is being conducted by my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Review is nearing completion and I will  consider its recommendations shortly. It is intended that a public consultation on the Review will also take place.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-24a.20.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092400069#WRA01900"><p><i>15.</i> To ask the Minister for Justice and Equality the actions she will take to reduce anti-social behaviour in Dublin city centre; the number of convictions that have been secured through the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2011 by year to date in 2014; if she will consider establishing a dedicated public order unit for Dublin city centre; and if she will make a statement on the matter. <b>[35372/14]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-24a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092400069#WRA02000"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda personnel and for the management and organisation of Garda operational units.  I am assured that Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region keep this deployment under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including with respect to concerns about public order and anti-social behaviour, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of policing resources.</p><p>  I do of course appreciate the issues of concern which the Deputy has raised and would draw his attention to the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan which has been operational since June 2013.  Garda actions under the Plan include dedicated high visibility patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares.  These patrols are informed by crime trends, demand studies and footfall in the areas in question.  I am also aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages extensively with business and community interests in the city centre area with respect to crime prevention, enforcement and policing concerns.</p><p>  The Garda approach includes focusing resources on specific areas of the city according to need.   As part of this, a number of targeted city centre policing operations are in place.</p><p>  These operations include Operation Pier, which concentrates on the South Quays and Temple Bar area.  This operation includes the designation of certain areas as &quot;hotspots&quot; for anti-social behaviour and regular uniformed and plain clothes patrols.  Other Garda Operations in the city centre include Operation Spire which is focused on the O&rsquo;Connell Street and North Inner City areas, and Operation Stilts which is an ongoing overt policing operation targeting anti-social behaviour and drug-related crime in Dublin city centre locations.</p><p>  I am conscious of the perspectives of business and community interests about the effects of certain types of crime and anti-social behaviour on the environment for business and leisure and on the overall quality of life for residents.  Some of the problems faced are linked to disorder associated with abuse of alcohol and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with a wide range of businesses involved in the entertainment and nighttime economy to address these issues so that people can enjoy themselves without concern for their welfare. </p><p>  Other challenges have their origin in even more complex social phenomena which go well beyond the capacity of criminal justice agencies to address on their own.  Dealing with these matters requires a co-ordinated approach from state agencies involved in social, housing, health and drug treatment services, as well as through partnership with business, community and voluntary groups.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already a long-term partner in a range of local consultative and representative structures in Dublin and elsewhere.  I am considering how we can step up this co-operation with a view to developing collaborative solutions to the range of issues which affect policing and the overall quality of the environment in our urban centres. </p><p>  With regard to the Deputy's request for specific information regarding convictions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2011 by year to date in 2014 in Dublin City Centre, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-24a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092400069#WRA02300"><p>The question of extending the remit of the Ombudsman is in the first instance a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and that remit was significantly extended under the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  However, after careful consideration of all the issues involved, it was determined that the administration of the law relating to immigration or naturalisation, including direct provision centres, should not be within the scope of the Ombudsman.  Not least in this debate was the fact that there are already a significant number of appeal processes built into the system including Judicial Reviews.  That said, the matter will be kept under review.  I should also add that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) has administrative arrangements in place with the Office to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br/><br/>In terms of oversight of our prisons, the Office of the Inspector of Prisons has been established on a statutory basis since 2007 by virtue of Part 5 of the Prisons Act, 2007 and is independent. The Inspector has an important role in ensuring an effective independent oversight of our prison system and has my full support in carrying out his remit.<br/><br/>I intend to strengthen the independent oversight of our prison system.  In line with plans announced previously, the Government has approved the drafting of a General Scheme of an Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.  I believe this will make them more effective and improve the independent oversight of our prisons.<br/><br/>Once finalised later this year, the General Scheme will be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for pre legislative scrutiny and for the conduct of a broad consultation process with civil society.  Following the conclusion of this consultation process Parliamentary Counsel will be requested to draft the Bill in line with the General Scheme. <br/><br/>In the circumstances I am not convinced that there is any added value in extending the remit of the Ombudsman to our prisons. </p></reply>

This Bill is currently being drafted and I intend to publish the Bill as soon as possible in order for it to be enacted in the current Oireachtas session. The Bill will enable the Health Service Executive to make available, without charge a range of services.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-24a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092400070#WRB00700"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the principle of a rate of remission greater than the standard rate of 25 per cent, was introduced as a means of incentivising prisoners to engage with as wide a range of activities and services available to them throughout the prison estate as a means of assisting them in increasing their likelihood to successfully reintegrate back into society when their sentences are complete and to increase the likelihood that they would not reoffend.</p><p>  The principle of greater remission was introduced into the Irish prison system through Statutory Instrument 252 of 2007 (referred to as the Prison Rules). Rule 59 allowed for the granting of greater remission to certain classes of prisoner by virtue of good conduct whilst imprisoned. The most important aspect of the Rule however, is outlined in Rule 59 (2) which specifies that - </p><p>  &quot;The Minister may grant such greater remission of sentence in excess of one quarter, but not exceeding one third thereof where a prisoner has shown further good conduct by engaging in authorised structured activity and the Minister is satisfied that, as a result, the prisoner is less likely to reoffend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community&quot;.</p><p>  The Deputy will therefore appreciate that the central thrust of the Rule and the central consideration that I must take into account when deciding whether or not to grant individual prisoner's a rate of remission greater than the standard, is whether or not, through his/her (i) conduct in prison and (ii) the extent to which authorised structured activity has been engaged in, the prisoner has demonstrated that he or she is less-likely to reoffend if released at a time earlier than the normal remission date.</p><p>  Arising from a number of judicial challenges to decisions made by me in respect of applications by prisoners for greater remission, and in consideration of comments by members of the judiciary hearing those challenges, on the advice of the Attorney General, I amended the Rule by introducing Statutory Instrument SI 335 of 2014 in August of this year. The purpose of this amendment was to bring greater clarity to the Prison Rules by outlining to prisoners the precise factors to be taken into account by me when considering whether or not to grant a prisoner a greater rate of remission.</p><p>  I will not read into the record of the House the full provisions of the amended Rule, as the full Rule is available in the Library and elsewhere. However, I will outline that the main considerations include the nature and gravity of the offence, the period of the sentence served, the potential threat to public safety, the views (where relevant) of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of course the prisoner's conduct as well as his or her engagement with authorised structured activities.</p><p>  Finally, with regard to the number of court challenges arising, it is of course inevitable that some prisoners will feel aggrieved by negative decisions and will seek recourse through the Courts. I cannot, and would not, interfere in their right to do so. In view of the fact that a number of challenges remain before the Courts, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the reasons why any decision has been or will be appealed to the Supreme Court.  However, I can advise the House that any decisions to appeal certain judgements to the Supreme Court have been (and will be) taken in consideration of the advice of the Attorney General.</p></reply>

Those records were created on the basis of entry and were not dependent on the reason for entry or the legal status of the person concerned.  However not all records for all the Magdalen laundries going back to the foundation of the State have survived.</p><p>  There are very few State records that refer to a person's entry to a Magdalen laundry although there are more frequently State records of a more general nature which can serve to corroborate or otherwise, a person's presence in this type of institution.</p><p>  In cases where the relevant religious congregation have incomplete or no record for an applicant, or where the applicants disagree with the records, my officials carry out a thorough examination, checking whatever records are available from other departments, agencies and institutions to support the claim.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking into account any available records or documents as well as the applicant's testimony.

Many of the frontiers are unguarded and porous.</p><p>  The number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones since 2010 is estimated at between 25 and 30, 3 of whom are known to have died.</p><p>  Within that number are individuals who would have travelled to Libya and other Arab States to take part in the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring which began in December 2010. Some of these are known to have returned.</p><p>  As previously stated, the phenomenon of individuals travelling to the conflict zones has affected the majority of European States and it is one to which Ireland gave priority during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. In that connection Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the Member States to carry out a review of the EU Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism.</p><p>  A primary point of focus in this review is the foreign fighter issue. A number of initiatives at EU level have been developed to combat this phenomenon including community relations initiatives, media campaigns, enhanced tracking of movements, engagement with third countries (notably Turkey) and engagement with internet service providers to curb radical online content.</p><p>  In Ireland An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour and in line with best practice internationally has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas. In tandem with that the Garda&iacute; operate a progressive community relations programme through its Racial Inter-Cultural and Diversity Office. That office is in regular contact with our minority communities and recently received favourable comment on its operation from the UN Counter Terrorism Committee.  It is of course essential that at times like this entire communities do not get stigmatised because of the actions of a few. It has to be recognised that the vast majority of our citizens wish only to go about their daily lives in peace.</p><p>  I am also fully committed to safeguarding the security of the Common Travel Area. This is given the highest priority by our Immigration Service. Operational and data sharing cooperation with the UK immigration authorities is at an all time high.  Across all aspects of immigration, including visas, asylum, citizenship and border control, there is unprecedented day to day cooperation between the two countries. This includes the sharing on a daily basis of large amounts of information on visa applicants to detect persons who are trying to enter either country by evading immigration controls and checks. At ports of entry there is close operational cooperation involving constant liaison between Irish and British immigration officers on individuals arriving at our borders.</p><p>  The enhanced cooperation has stemmed from quarterly meetings of senior Irish and British immigration officials over a number of years and has been discussed between myself and my UK counterpart and at Taoiseach / Prime Minister level.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that I recently published new legislation in the form of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014.  The Bill will transpose into Irish law an EU Council Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2008/919/JHA).  In particular, the Bill, when enacted will amend the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 to create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</p></reply>

Part of the proposed redevelopment includes the provision of high quality prison accommodation for female prisoners with capacity for approximately 50 individual cells and 8 custodial apartments.<br/><br/>When I published The Penal Policy Review Report on Wednesday 17 September 2014 I highlighted that the report called for the establishment of an open centre for women as well as gender appropriate strategies for the management of women offenders.  I also highlighted that The Irish Prison Service has established a sub-group to examine where such a facility might be provided within the prison estate. Once the subgroup has reported, I intend to ask the Prison Service to bring forward further feasibility proposals on developing such an open centre for women prisoners.<br/><br/>The Irish Prison Service provides to those in custody a wide range of rehabilitative programmes, which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release. <font color="#1F497D"> </font>The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service three year strategic plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the strategy to enhance sentence planning through  Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.  <br/><br/>On 6 March 2014 the IPS published a Women&rsquo;s Strategy entitled &quot;An Effective Response to Women Who Offend&quot;. The Women&rsquo;s Strategy  sets out how the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service work together, as well as with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners, to provide women-focused interventions to help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally. This co-operative approach is a direct result of the Joint Irish Prison Service/Probation Service Female Strategy 2014-2016 which aims to deliver more effective offender management.</p></reply>

Ireland considers that the work being undertaken in other fora such as the IMF and the upcoming third International Conference on Financing for Development in 2015 offer more appropriate and established means to progress dialogue on the matter. <br/><br/>Ireland has always had concern for developing countries experiencing debt problems. In this regard, Ireland continues to support processes aimed at resolving these problems through progressing dialogue in the most appropriate forum and using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms, to best support these countries.<br/><br/>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the detailed statement made on behalf of the European Union to the General Assembly of the United Nations in this matter, which is available at </p></reply>

Revenue has made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the past three years and now media reports indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly referred to as petrol-stretching.  This involves the illegal addition of kerosene or some other low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the Exchequer and the motorist.</p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under S102 (1A) Finance Act 1999 and carries a penalty on summary conviction of &euro;5,000 or, at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. If convicted on indictment the fine is to a maximum of &euro;126,970 and the prison term is to a maximum of 5 years or both.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and have been in contact with the motor trade in this regard. I am also advised that they have taken samples from a number of filling stations that it has claimed may have been the source of adulterated fuel. These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that kerosene has been added to the petrol being sold by the retailers in question and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.</p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that with this cooperation, and with the supply chain information available to Revenue,  the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or 'stretched' fuel.  </p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol from, and report any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines to Revenue. Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.</p><p>  A key part of the mineral oil tax regulatory system to protect the Exchequer and consumers is the licensing system that ensures that dealers in mineral oil, including forecourt operators, keep proper records and only source and supply legitimate fuel. At Revenue's request, I have strengthened the legislative framework to refuse and /or revoke mineral oil licences. Revenue has been very pro-active in this sector over the last three years and from mid-2011 to the end of August 2014, 132 filling stations were closed, mainly for breaches of licensing conditions. </p><p>  I will carefully consider any new proposals by Revenue to ensure that the licensing system is robust and acts to protect consumers, the legitimate trade and Exchequer receipts.  </p><p>  I would also like to advise the Deputies that the first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles have been affected should be the insurance companies they hold their policies with.   Further to that, those affected should also contact the point of purchase and seek redress through them.  If they remain unsatisfied they may have recourse to civil remedies and as such could seek legal advice.</p></reply>

However, I would make the point that these estimates are subject to finalisation in light of the end-September Exchequer figures and other salient information.</p><p>  With regard to water charges, I am informed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that the Commissioner for Energy Regulation is to make a determination on the level of charges later this month.  The monies raised for water charges will be received by Irish Water which is a not part of general government. As such, these receipts do not count as general government revenue and accordingly will not impact on the deficit.</p></reply>

The programme is supported by a combination of student fees, State funding and other income.  <br/><br/>While in this case the fees could be considered high, in the majority of cases where third level tuition fees are payable they are at much lower levels.  In addition, those participating in the programme must already have acquired an undergraduate degree, the fees for which would have been covered by the State in the vast majority of cases. <br/><br/>I would point out that tax relief at the standard rate of 20% is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, including a postgraduate course. <br/><br/>Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &quot;student contribution&quot;.  No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees. A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.<br/><br/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).  Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750.  Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375.  Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>Fees</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Tuition fees</td><td>&euro;15,000</td></tr><tr><td>Capped at </td><td>&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less</td><td>&euro;2,750</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850</td></tr></table><br/><br/>It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. However, as with all tax reliefs, the introduction of tax relief for loans taken out to pursue the graduate entry medical programme will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill and any announcements will be made on Budget Day.</p></reply>

In the case of the Clonakilty Scheme, commencement of works, which is currently expected to be in late 2015 would also depend on satisfactory completion of the Exhibition process.

The focus of the study is to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by the TTIP.  </p><p>  The preliminary findings of the consultants were presented at a conference on TTIP that I hosted on 20 June last, to which Oireachtas members from relevant Joint Committees were invited.  These indicate that a comprehensive trade and investment deal between the EU and the US could lead to a 1.1% increase in Irish GDP.  The consultants find that the TTIP has the potential to strengthen Ireland's position as a hub for multi-national enterprises in the EU market and to increase investment to Ireland by 1.6%.  Other preliminary findings show benefits for Ireland including an increase in exports by 2.7%, and in real wages by 1.4% based on scenarios used in the study.</p></reply>

These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, details of such visits are provided on a county by county basis only.  As Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s core focus is supporting the internationalisation of indigenous companies, the Agency does not arrange site visits of a type similar to IDA Ireland.<br/><br/>Details of the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Galway in respect of each of the years in question are set out in the attached tabular statement.  <br/><br/>County Galway has had particular success in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment particularly in the areas of Medical Technologies and ICT.  At the end of 2013 there were 60 IDA Ireland client companies in Galway City and County employing over 13,600 people in full and part time employment.  Similarly, at the end of 2013 there were 273 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Galway employing almost 7,000 people in full and part time employment.<br/><br/>IDA Ireland is actively marketing the former AT Cross building in Ballinasloe to potential investors and details of it have been forwarded a number of times to potential investors as a potential property solution and we will continue to do so along with marketing the available lands in the IDA Business and Technology Park in Ballinasloe.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland continues to promote employment throughout the county, including Ballinasloe by providing a wide range of supports to existing exporters to help them win new business from outside Ireland.  The Agency also encourages the creation of new high potential start-up companies and promotes exporting as a new revenue stream for companies that have not exported previously.  In addition, they support local communities to nurture enterprise locally through supporting the development of Community Enterprise Centres.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, on 15 April last the new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) were established as the primary source of support for small and micro enterprises across the country.  The new service means that national enterprise policy and local business supports have been brought together to strengthen the local business culture and environment, combining the best of the former County and City Enterprise Boards and the Local Authorities, overseen by the Centre of Excellence in Enterprise Ireland.<br/><br/>The LEOs are the first-stop-shop front-line service assisting in delivering business growth and jobs.  They provide both financial and soft supports, and pull together all the players &ndash; other Government Departments and Agencies &ndash; to support everyone with a good business idea, strengthen the enterprise sector in the local area and, ultimately, support the delivery of more jobs within their local area.<br/><br/>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.<br/><br/>On 30 July 2014 I launched my Department's Policy Statement on foreign Direct Investment in Ireland which sets out the strategic direction for foreign direct investment to 2020 and the key actions needed to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness and business environment in the context of intensified international competition for investment and talent.<br/><br/>IDA Ireland are currently developing a new corporate strategy for the period 2015 &ndash; 2020 which reflects this policy statement and the need to address regional issues.<br/><br/><b>Table showing the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Galway from 2009 to 2013.</b><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>Number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits </td><td>22</td><td>41</td><td>35</td><td>18</td><td>15</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A frame of reference to guide specific structured consultations being undertaken in the context of a new strategy will be developed at the appropriate time in the process. <br/><br/>The focus at the moment is identifying, through dialogue with existing consultation groups including the Prioritisation Action Group, Technology Ireland, Horizon 2020 Implementation Group, Knowledge Transfer Ireland Industry Advisory Group etc., the key issues that should be included in any new strategy on Science Technology and Innovation.<br/><br/>My Department is also identifying key issues arising through participation in a number of groups with broad stakeholder representation in relevant sectoral areas including Health (through the Healthy Ireland Council and the Health Innovation Hub National Project Team), Smart Aging (through a group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach) and Marine (through the Marine Coordination Group).  Moreover, officials in my Department are also involved in groups with representation from academic, industry and government bodies, including special initiative groups on &quot;big data&quot; and &quot;manufacturing&quot;. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a support network of National Contact Points coordinated by Enterprise Ireland comprising knowledgeable and experienced practitioners from relevant Departments and agencies interacts with companies and academics in relation to funding opportunities presented by Horizon 2020.<br/><br/>In addition, a number of key reports are being or have recently been prepared in my Department &ndash; all of which had structured consultation with stakeholders built in, and all of which will inform the new strategy.  These include, inter alia: <br/><br/>- Research Prioritisation Action Plans;<br/><br/>- Identification of fine-grained enterprise research needs for the 14 Research Prioritisation Priority Areas;<br/><br/>- Medium Term Development of the Irish Market Focussed Element of the Irish Research Centre Landscape Ecosystem; <br/><br/>- Optimising Policy Intervention to Strengthen the Impacts of Enterprise RD&amp;amp;I in Ireland.<br/><br/>In addition, I am aware of further work being undertaken in the Department of Education and Skills to which I am also assigned, which also has an important consultative dimension and which will very usefully inform the development of a new strategy.  These include a review of funding of the Higher Education sector, a review of STEM education and target-setting by Higher Education Institutions for Horizon 2020. <br/><br/>My view is that there are substantial and diverse channels of ongoing consultation which are being used to inform the developmental stage of the new strategy and these can be supplemented as necessary, as I have said, with an appropriate frame of reference to guide further focused consultations as necessary and at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

Once such approval is granted, my Department will move to open the Scheme for applications. I would hope to be able to do so before the end of the year, but this is entirely dependent on approval being secured in time from the EU. However, I am confident that the scheme will be open to applications in 2015 and I am making provision for up to 30,000 applicants in the first year. Payments for 2015 will be in respect of a part-year only, as is normal with the commencement of a new scheme like this, but contracts will then run for their full five year term from 2016. This means that entrants into GLAS next year will benefit from an additional part-payment in respect of 2015, on top of the usual five year contract. </p></reply>

The primary compensation measure available under the TB Eradication scheme is the On Farm Market Valuation scheme. In 2013, my Department paid &euro;10.5m to 3,376 herdowners under this Scheme. In addition, herdowners may also qualify for additional payments under the Income Supplement, Hardship or Depopulation Grant schemes subject to compliance with the criteria applying in each scheme. Grants of &euro;1.5m were paid to 934 herdowners under this scheme in 2013.

I am committed to working with farmers and industry to both deal with the current difficulties, and ensure we have the right measures in place to aid producers achieve better margins on their farms.  While of course I cannot influence prices or commercial interactions between buyers and sellers, I have been actively engaging with the sector with the aim of mitigating the impact of the drop in prices from the highs experienced last year.</p><p>  This year alone, I have brought forward a number of initiatives to help the sector, including the creation of the Beef Genomics Scheme with a budget of &euro;23 million in 2014. I have also ensured that the budgets of the Beef Data Programme and the Beef Technology Adoption Programme are retained at &euro;10 million and &euro;5 million which , when added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme , amounts to an investment of &euro;40m in 2014.</p><p>  I also plan to build on these schemes through the provision for a Beef Data and Genomics Programme in the Rural Development Plan submitted to the EU Commission in July of this year.The Bovine Data and Genomics Programme is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the quality and environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology. This will help farmers to maximise productivity in a sustainable way, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd. It will provide &euro;295 million to suckler beef farmers over its 6 year duration, adding &euro;80 for every animal for which the required actions are undertaken. I must emphasise of course that this scheme remains a proposal pending discussions with the European Commission on the finalisation of the RDP.</p><p>  This is just one of a series of measures in the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme which are focussed on the beef sector. It will also benefit from large scale State and EU investment in a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), some &euro;195 million per year for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint) and a progressive new Knowledge Transfer measure. It should also be remembered that this is in addition to the &euro;1.2 billion secured for direct payments each year.   </p><p>  My role in relation to the beef sector is to create a policy and support environment that will allow it to flourish in line with normal market principles. As I have stated before, I do not believe a Beef Regulator is appropriate. As the Deputy will appreciate, questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle. It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU, to intervene directly on these issues. Cattle prices are determined by supply / demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by the seasonality of production, the length of the production lifecycle and market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation.</p><p>  It is, of course, important that farmers are sufficiently remunerated for producing quality animals. Beef producers must be provided with appropriate production incentives that are reflective of market demands and are communicated to producers in a clear and timely manner. I will continue to engage with both farmers and processors to ensure that the market operates in a fair and transparent manner. As the Deputy is aware, I established a Beef Roundtable earlier this year to facilitate such discussions between the parties. One of the key outcomes arising from this Roundtable involves better and more timely communication between processors and producers aimed at transmitting early and clearer market signals which bring about more strategically planned sectoral responses. Another key outcome has been my announcement of a public consultation regarding possible establishment of producer organisations in the beef sector. This public consultation has now closed and my Department are currently assessing the responses before deciding on next steps. Producer organisations can play a key role in conveying contractual negotiation powers on groups of farmers which can help to address imbalances in the supply chain.</p><p>  I should also point out that there is an array of information already available on the prices paid in Ireland and elsewhere. My Department collates the prices paid for domestic cattle on a weekly basis and reports this data to the European Commission in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1249/2008 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 148/2014. To ensure price transparency, results for Members States are published on the DG Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development website. The published weekly data includes market prices for carcases and live animals as well as information on production and herd inventories. This publicly accessible information allows stakeholders to monitor the evolution of the market situation in each Member State. </p><p>  There is also a wealth of information available to farmers under the Beef PriceW   atch section on my Department&rsquo;s website, including the prices for Steers, Cows, and Heifers across the classification grid, for each DAFM approved factory. I have also committed to making this existing information even more user-friendly and my Department is currently working on developing a Beef PriceWatch app which will be released shortly. </p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review.<br/><br/>In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue. In this regard, the identification of venues as part of the review process does not necessarily mean that the identified venues will close.<b><font color="#0000FF"> </font></b>For example, the Deputy may wish to note the outcome of the recent extensive consultations process in the Dublin region which has resulted in the Courts Service deciding not to proceed with its proposals to close a number of suburban courthouses. The Courts Service has confirmed that no decision on an individual venue is taken without prior consultation with local stakeholders. It should, however, be noted that the final decision is a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-24a.244" nospeaker="true" ><p>In regard to Garda stations, each year the Commissioner prepares a Policing Plan which outlines An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's proposals for providing a policing service to the country for the following year. Among other things, this plan must include any proposals the Commissioner has for the re-organisation of the Divisional or Regional network together with any plans for the closure of an existing Garda station or the opening of a new Garda station.

In 2012 the Garda Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister, closed 39 Garda stations, some of which had not been opened for several years and most of which were closed for the most part of the day. In 2013, a further 100 Garda stations were closed. These closures resulted in 61,000 patrolling hours being made available to the Garda Commissioner for frontline operational policing. No stations were closed in 2014 and while the Policing Plan for 2015 has not yet been completed, I do not expect that it will contain any proposals for further closures. The Deputy should be aware that there are still 564 Garda stations in the State and that a major review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being carried out under the Haddington Road Agreement. The outcome of that review will assist the Garda Commissioner in determining the best distribution model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the best possible service continues to be provided across the country and that the links with local communities is maintained to the maximum extent possible.  The following tables list all of the stations closed, both rural and urban, in 2012 and 2013.

The staffing levels of INIS which forms part of the Department of Justice and Equality ranged from 615 in 2011 to its current level of 519 (full time equivalents).

This latter budget is administered by the Reception of Integration Agency of my Department.</p><p>  The variations in the overall budget estimates over the years in question relate in the main to the reduction in the cost of the Direct Provision system linked to reduced numbers in accommodation, reductions in salary costs and savings achieved under the Croke Park/Haddington Road agreement.  These reductions are offset to some degree by increased investment in information technology particularly in 2013 and this year.</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.<br/><br/>Currently, there are over 4,300 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres across 16 counties. The expenditure outturn for the accommodation costs incurred by RIA in the last three years is as follows:<table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Outturn</b></th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;55.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;62.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;69.5m</td></tr></table>The 2014 Estimate Provision for RIA is &euro;51.9 million.  More detailed information on the breakdown of costs associated with the Direct Provision system can be found on the Annual Reports for the years in question on RIA's website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the direct provision system is only one element of the State&rsquo;s response to its international obligations on the asylum issue.  As well as educational, health and welfare costs, there is the asylum determination system itself, as well as the downstream judicial and policing costs.  All countries which take their responsibilities in this area seriously are faced with similar calls on their financial resources.  For example, it was estimated that in the period 2005 to 2009 inclusive, the total amount spent across the whole of Government on asylum seekers was &euro;1,275.31 million, of which &euro;424.43 million was spent on the direct provision system.  </p></reply>

These Annual Reports provide a variety of information, including a breakdown of the numbers of adults and children in each direct provision centre and the length of time persons, overall, have been residing in the direct provision system.  This is also provided on a centre by centre basis, and the counties in which these centres are located are identified in these reports.

The conditions are that the applicant must -<br/><br/>- be of full age<br/><br/>- be of good character<br/><br/>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years<br/><br/>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation<br/><br/>- have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows&mdash;</font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">  (i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">  (ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font><br/><br/>A foreign national who is married to, or is the civil partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law. Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.<br/><br/>Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons. <br/><br/>It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended. <br/><br/>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  <br/><br/>As the Deputy can appreciate it is not practical from an operational, available resources or a security perspective to provide education and/or vocational training exclusively for the use of first time offenders.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<br/><br/>The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through  Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  <br/><br/>As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. <br/><br/>The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB). Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the ETBs and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.  The partnership endeavours to meet the needs of students through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.  A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University. There is an increasing focus on FETAC accreditation as the modular structure best meets the needs of students in prison. <br/><br/>Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.<br/><br/>The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  110 Work Training Officers have recently been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.<br/><br/>The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification. <br/><br/>The manner in which records are collated does not allow us to differentiate between first-time offenders and repeat offenders.<br/><br/>However, from the records that are available I can inform the Deputy that figures  are compiled retrospectively and the latest available figures (09/06/2014 to 13/06/2014) show that an overall total of 1,490 offenders participated in Education activities which represents almost 37% of the prisoner population at that time.  <br/><br/>Similarly an average of 1,052 prisoners engaged in vocational training activities each day in June and this represents 27% of the average prison population in that month.  It should be noted that a prisoner may participate in more than one activity.<br/><br/>The above figure are a mix of first time offenders and those that have been in custody previously.<table><tr><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This information is being collated and will be provided directly to the Deputy.<br/><br/>The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that sentenced prisoners may be approved temporary release whether it be for a few hours or a more extended period.  The Act sets out the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account.<br/><br/>Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect. Before a final determination a number of factors may be taken into account including: -<br/><br/>- the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates<br/><br/>- the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed<br/><br/>- the period of the sentence served by the person<br/><br/>- the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released<br/><br/>- the person's previous criminal record<br/><br/>- the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release<br/><br/>- the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release<br/><br/>- any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release<br/><br/>- the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release<br/><br/>- the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release<br/><br/>- the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment<br/><br/>Temporary release assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to prisoners. It is an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each application for temporary release for whatever reason, including those referred to in your question, is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.  <br/><br/>In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a daily basis to the offender's Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute; or maybe refused another period of reviewable temporary release.</p></reply>

Membership/allegiance to criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated. <br/><br/>The emergence in recent years of criminal gangs has had significant implications for the management of Irish prisons.  Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside of prison.  Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates in the prisons or criminal activities on the outside.<br/><br/>Gang members are managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership/allegiance of these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated.<br/><br/>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.  For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG)  have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.

However, pending the development of new facilities in Oberstown which are currently under construction, 17 year old children on remand must remain detained at St Patrick's Institution for legal reasons.  There are no prisoners including those under 18 years of age serving a sentence in St Patrick's Institution. <br/><br/>In line with the Government decision an area of Wheatfield Prison was renovated to house 17 year old sentenced prisoners pending the completion of the Oberstown facilities. This unit can hold up to 16 prisoners and all sentenced 17 year old prisoners are housed there. On  Monday 22 September, 2014 there were nine 17 year old sentenced prisoners in the Wheatfield unit.<table><tr><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In that regard I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out the Policing Plan for 2014, which includes commitments to target individuals and groups engaged in organised criminal activity.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be in a position to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.</p><p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.

The Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, expected to become operational later this year, which was established on foot of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, 2014.</p></reply>

The Presidents monitor waiting times across all court lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time. The Deputy may wish to refer to Section 6 of the recently published Courts Service Annual Report which contains information on Waiting Times across the various court jurisdictions.<br/><br/>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Courts Service and the judiciary is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in so far as is possible and appropriate, within the terms of its mandate, in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.<br/><br/>The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas of greatest need.  The Presidents continue to arrange additional sittings where possible within the resources available to them to deal with any delays in the hearing of cases. The Courts Service is also working with the judiciary on the implementation of a number of initiatives in relation to court procedures and  initiatives arising from the report of the cross agency Working Group established to identify and implement efficiency measures with a specific focus on the high volume Circuit and District Courts.  These include the centralisation of custody cases and the use of alternative courts venues in the District Court; a new practice direction in the Circuit Court in relation to sending forward for trial; a pre-trial procedure which is operating in the Dublin and the Midland Circuits on a pilot basis from 1 December 2012; increased use of video links between courts and prisons; and the provision of same-day probation reports.<br/><br/>I am informed that waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases. In relation to the High Court, waiting times are generally in the range of 1 to 5 months except in relation to Asylum cases where the delay is currently over 2 years.  I am informed that delays in the Asylum list are due to several factors including the high volume of cases. Delays in lists also occur where parties who have certified the case as ready to proceed and/or applied for a hearing date inform the court that they are not ready to proceed on the allocated date and apply for adjournment.<br/><br/>The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous and additional sittings were held during August and September with a view to maintaining the improvements made in waiting times in recent years. The High Court has, as is usual, dealt with bail lists on one or two days each week during the court vacation and sat each day and during several weekends to hear matters arising of an urgent nature. These sittings will continue until the commencement of the next legal term.<br/><br/>The ongoing delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by the High Court judges has also yielded significant savings in judicial times resulting in increased judicial availability for trial work.  The re-organisation of sittings of the High Court outside Dublin by the President of the High Court also continues to achieve efficiencies in the use of judicial time.<br/><br/>The Courts Service has indicated that<font color="#2020A0"> </font>the waiting times in the Central Criminal Court are 16 months. Waiting times in the Supreme Court for certified cases are on average 11 months for the priority list and 48 months for the general list. In the Supreme Court remedial actions have been taken to reduce the number of uncertified cases.  A total of 255 appeals have been disposed of by the Supreme Court to date this year in its continuing programme of managing uncertified appeals.  A further 115 uncertified appeals are proposed to be listed on 29September 2014 for this purpose.<br/><br/>In the first and second quarters of 2014 there was a 13% increase in new appeals lodged and an 81% increase in the number of appeals disposed of when compared with the same period in 2013.While some immediate improvement has been achieved in reducing the backlog that has accumulated in the Supreme Court over the past number of years, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court will only be fully resolved through the introduction of the Court of Appeal which is due to be established in October 2014.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that delays in the hearing of cases can occur for a number of reasons which can be outside the control of the courts and the Courts Service, e.g. the unavailability of a witness or where the parties or the legal practitioners may not be ready to proceed. This can give rise to adjournments which can have an impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting.</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. Currently, 4,330 persons are residing in 34 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware from my answer to Question 35740/14 today as to how the Government intends to give effect to the commitment in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 &ndash; 2016 in relation to the protection process, including direct provision.</p><p>  I believe that we can make improvements which will have a direct bearing on the quality of life which those in direct provision enjoy. That is what lies behind the decision to establish the  Working Group to report to Government on improvements with the protection process,  including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.</p><p>  More generally, we should not lose sight of the fact that the direct provision and dispersal system means that the State has been able to fulfil its obligations to meet the needs of persons arriving in the stage seeking protection who cannot provide their basic needs for themselves.  Direct provision has ensured that the housing needs of more that 51,000 protection seekers have been met since the system was introduced in 1999 and that no protection seeker has been left homeless in that time.</p></reply>

Articles 15, 16 and 17 of the Convention outline how the Convention shall operate and states what agencies or bodies shall be responsible for the transmission of various documents between the two Contracting States. Initially the transmission of these documents is the responsibility of the National Central Authorities, but under Article 22 of the Convention, these functions can be delegated to approved Accredited Bodies.  The involvement of accredited bodies in inter-country adoption is the norm, and accreditation of adoption agencies is accepted as one of the important safeguards introduced by the 1993 Hague Convention. It is an essential step to improve the quality and safety of inter-country adoptions now and in the future. Any private agency wishing to undertake inter-country adoptions in Convention States must be licensed by and accountable to a supervising or accrediting authority (the Adoption Authority in Ireland).</p><p>  Currently, there are two Accredited Bodies registered by the Adoption Authority of Ireland to facilitate inter-country adoptions. Both have approval from the Adoption Authority to charge a Common Programme Fee of &euro;6,500 per application. This fee applies to all applications and all countries. The fee covers the costs incurred by the agencies in respect of the overheads and costs incurred by them in Ireland. These costs include &ndash; staffing, accommodation, insurance, office supplies, staff training and maintenance of the client&rsquo;s application. Activities covered include the transmission of the Adoption Authority&rsquo;s Article 15 Assessments Report, the Article 16 Child Referral, the Article 17 Placement Agreement and the Article 23 Conformity Certificate, as well as client support during these activities. The Adoption Authority has advised that it is satisfied that based on figures supplied via the Hague Convention Permanent Bureau in The Hague, the approved Common Programme Fee is within the international norm.</p><p>  With regard to inter-country adoptions from the U.S., the functions outlined in Articles 15, 16 and 17 have been delegated by the US Central Authority to a number of Adoption Service Providers and on the Irish side, those functions were delegated to Arc Adoption Limited. This delegation of functions was carried out pursuant to Section 66(2) of the Adoption Act 2010. </p><p>  In addition to the Common Programme Fee referred to above, there are in-country costs. In the case of the United States of America, these costs are &euro;1,600 for Arc Adoption Ltd., (to cover direct expenses - couriers, medical advisor and post-adoption reports coordination) and a figure of between &euro;35,403 and &euro;44,204 charged by the US Adoption Service Providers. These in-country costs to US Adoption Service Providers have previously been paid by prospective adopters directly to the Service Provider.</p><p>  While the Adoption Authority publishes notices of the approved fee programmes on its website, comprehensive details and breakdowns are available from the accredited bodies themselves.</p></reply>

The Report also highlights the increasing service challenge facing the Agency, with 9,548 cases waiting to be allocated to a dedicated social worker.  </p><p>  Approximately one third of these, (3,240 cases), were deemed to be high priority. These cases represent a mix of new referrals that need further assessment and social work input, as well as children known to the Agency who need a continuing social work service.

We must ensure that the most vulnerable children in our society receive a timely and appropriate response.</p><p>  The data and analysis contained in &quot;Measuring the Pressure&quot; provides critical management information to assist the Agency in service planning and resource allocation. </p><p>  The Agency is in receipt of funding of &euro;6.7m this year to alleviate identified service pressures and to support the continuing implementation of the reform programme across children and family services.  </p><p>  This funding is being targeted at a number of areas, including the replacement of staff on maternity leave by way of  a 12 month temporary contract. Latest figures indicate that at the end of August, 164 staff were on maternity leave, 82 of whom were social workers. The Agency is also finalising proposals for the introduction of a guaranteed and protected one year induction programme for newly qualified social workers. </p><p>  The Agency recruited 106 social workers up to the end of August this year and a further 148 posts are at various stages of recruitment.  </p><p>  The initiatives described above are designed to assist the Agency in responding to identified service pressures and to provide for a targeted response to such pressures, taking account of identified need and available resources.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive National Service Plan 2014 and the recently published 2014 Operational Plan for the Social Care Division outline the quantum of specialist disability services, the key reform initiatives and the additional investment in 2014 which it has assured me will give effect to this vision in 2014. </p><p>  The HSE will spend &euro;1.4 billion and employ a staff level of approximately 15,000 whole time equivalents in 2014 to provide specified levels of services.

This commitment was fulfilled when two regulations, one relating to care and support and the second relating to registration issues, were approved and signed by the Minister for Health, with the scheme commencing on 1st November 2013. </p><p>  The introduction of registration and inspection represents a significant advance in terms of delivering consistent and high quality services for people with disabilities in residential services.  The purpose of the regulations is to safeguard and support the delivery of person-centred care to vulnerable people of any age who are receiving residential care services and ensure that their health, well-being and quality of life is promoted and protected. This will empower providers to deliver even higher quality standards.  </p><p>  Compliance with the HIQA standards is a requirement under the Service Level Arrangements (SLA) between the HSE and voluntary service providers in the disability sector.  To date, HIQA has published over 600 inspection reports and the lessons learned from them are continuing to improve our wider services and ensure that our clients are safe, secure and happy in their care.  </p><p>  I am informed that a number of service providers have raised concerns with the HSE on the additional costs arising in meeting the HIQA regulations.

The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines.<br/><br/>  In accordance with these procedures, the HSE asked the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) to conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the new product in June 2014.  This evaluation will provide detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine.  It will also assess whether the product is cost effective at the price quoted by the manufacturer.  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process.  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  It would not be appropriate to comment further on this matter until the HSE assessment process is complete.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that the Department has established an advisory group to examine the feasibility and cost implications of a multi-annual approach to the clinical and public health management of hepatitis C.  This group will furnish a report to the Minister for Health on this issue when it has completed its work.</p></reply>

Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.<br/><br/>The gross income limit for an over 70s medical card was set at in law at &euro;500 per week for a single person and at &euro;900 per week for a couple from 1 January 2014. The Government recognises that the living costs of an individual living alone are more than half the living costs of a couple living together and <font color="#212100">that expenditure does not necessarily diminish relative to the number of people in the household</font>. This is recognised, inter alia, through the provision of the Living Alone Increase and differential income limits for medical cards for persons aged under 70 years between individuals and couples. In that context, the over 70s income limit for a single person was reduced proportionately less than the income limit for a couple under this Budget change. There are no proposals to change this assessment process. <br/><br/>Persons aged 70 or over, who have lost their eligibility for a medical card due to the 2014 budgetary change will continue to have access to free GP services. In addition, as you will be aware, the Government committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service for the entire population and the aim is to have the over 70's phase implemented this year or early next year. Furthermore, any person over 70 that does not qualify for a medical card is able to use the DPS (Drugs Payment Scheme) which caps spending on prescription drugs. <br/><br/>It should also be noted that persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the standard means test, where they face particularly high expenses.  This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70s gross income thresholds.  <br/><br/>Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance.  The Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes.<br/><br/>The person's contribution towards their cost of care is calculated based on 80% of their income and 7.5% per annum of their assets.  If a person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets.  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<br/><br/>-  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<br/><br/>-  The first &euro;36,000 of a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment;<br/><br/>-  The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care.  This three year cap can also apply to family farms/businesses in certain circumstances;<br/><br/>-  Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the Scheme;<br/><br/>-  Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater;<br/><br/>-  If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, s/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater;<br/><br/>-  Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.</p></reply>

The Working Group was tasked with examining and making high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to:<br/><br/>- improving graduate retention in the public health system; <br/><br/>- planning for future service needs; <br/><br/>- and realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training. <br/><br/>In the course of its work, the Group considered issues including: <br/><br/>- the pathway for training at every level from Intern to Specialist; <br/><br/>- mentoring practices and career planning supports for medical graduates; <br/><br/>- measures to improve the quality of the training experience; <br/><br/>- career structures for doctors on completion of training. <br/><br/>The Strategic Review reports address a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health system, and offer solutions and recommendations that will enable us to build a sustainable medical workforce for the future.</p></reply>

Were the Passport Office to reinstate this reduced fee for those aged 65 and over or for any other category of adult applicants the shortfall would have to be met by the taxpayer.  The cost of exempting those aged 65 and over from passport fees was estimated in 2011 to be &euro;2.4 million per annum in terms of lost revenue. Therefore I have no plans to introduce any such measures at this time.  I would emphasise that the annualised fee for a standard Irish passport compares favourably with many other jurisdictions. At &euro;8 per year the Irish passport fee compares with approximately &euro;8 per year for a British passport, &euro;9 per year for a French passport, &euro;10 per year for a United States passport and &euro;15 per year for an Australian passport.</p></reply>

This policy has been underpinned by a set of complementary values which includes the protection of human rights; support for development; and the promotion of disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Arrangements for the overflight and landing of US military aircraft at Shannon Airport have been in place continuously under successive Governments for over fifty years.  I am satisfied that these arrangements, and those relating to the transit of US military personnel, are fully consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s policies and legal requirements, including our traditional policy of military neutrality<font color="#004080">.</font>The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland. In this context, permission for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports is given only on condition that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives<font color="#004080">,</font>do not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations.In accordance with international practice, foreign military aircraft passing through Ireland with the permission of the Government are not subject to routine searches or inspections. The principle of sovereign immunity applies automatically to foreign State or military aircraft, as it applies to Irish State or military aircraft abroad.We will continue to follow the practice of successive Governments whereby, in accordance with international practice, details supplied to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by diplomatic missions are accepted in good faith as being accurate.  Information provided to other States by Irish diplomatic missions seeking diplomatic clearance for flights undertaken by the Air Corps is similarly accepted by those countries to be accurate.  All other aircraft are subject to the normal inspections regime, which provides for the inspection of aircraft, among other reasons, in the interest of the security or safety of persons.<br/><br/><font color="#212100">  In relation to the transit of US military personnel through Shannon airport, the majority of these troops are carried on chartered civilian aircraft.  </font>Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended in 1989, civilian aircraft are prohibited from carrying weapons or munitions over Ireland or into Irish airports unless they receive an exemption from the Minister for Transport.  The US authorities are aware of the requirement that all carriers are obliged to seek permission for the transit of weapons and ammunition through Irish airports.<br/><br/>Ireland is not a party to the Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land.  The application of this Convention accordingly does not arise. </p></reply>

Attention is now turning to changes that will take place following the referendum and the plans outlined by Prime Minister Cameron on wider UK constitutional issues.   While a timetable and some broad principles have been outlined, the precise details of the changes are still to be clarified. I am in ongoing contact with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, while I expect to meet with the British Foreign Secretary shortly and discuss with him a range of issues. We will be in close contact with all administrations in these islands as detailed discussions proceed on enhanced devolution for Scotland and on the proposed changes across the UK.

While no two member states have identical positions across all policy areas, we share common interests with the UK on many issues of major importance.The Irish government wants to see the United Kingdom remain at the heart of the European Union. We believe that the EU is stronger on every level with the UK in it, while it is of course in our own national interests that the UK continues as a fully committed member.   This Government&rsquo;s position in relation to the United Kingdom&rsquo;s membership of the European Union is therefore clear and is regularly communicated to the authorities in London at both political and official level.

When account was taken of restricted reserves and other capital funding requirements, and pension reserves, the cash balance for recurrent purposes was &euro;568 million which also included private sources of income.<br/><br/>  Due to the significant cash balances identified, a decision was taken in Budget 2013 to apply a reduction of &euro;25m to the sector so as to ensure a more prudent management of existing cash balances.  This funding was not restored in Budget 2014 as it was felt that the Higher Education Institutions still had significant amounts of cash at their disposal. </p></reply>

This important strategy has now been completed and gives a road-map for the ongoing development of the FET sector over the next five years.  <br/><br/>  The FET Strategy contains a core objective that the planning and provision of FET is clearly informed by the needs of industry. SOLAS will examine the availability of genuine job opportunities in the restaurant, tourism and hospitality sectors and review training provision in that context in conjunction with the ETBs.<br/><br/>  SOLAS have noted that in 2014 Department of Social Protection registered Job Seekers listed as chefs number 1633 (as of August 2014) and the advertised number of vacancies for chefs, January to August, total some 2307.<br/><br/>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland on behalf of the Irish Hotel Federation and the Irish Restaurant Association is exploring the possibility with SOLAS of converting the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Level 6 Professional Cookery Traineeship programme into a formal Level 6 apprenticeship programme.  This will be considered in the overall context of implementing the recommendations of the recent review of apprenticeship.<br/><br/>  In addition, Momentum is funding 1,380 places in the Tourism (Accommodation, Food and Beverage) Sector for the 2014 round of funding. These projects will be run nationally and focus on various skills in the sector including front of house, culinary, restaurant and food and drink retail skills training. 72 places will be funded by Momentum and delivered by Kerry ETB in Professional Cookery - Front of House.<br/><br/>  The Expert Group on Future Skill Needs will shortly be conducting a study to assess the future skills requirements of the Hospitality Sector in Ireland up to 2020. The study will cover skill needs including skill gaps across occupations in hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering. The study will also identify gaps in current provision and the magnitude and type of provision required to address same. The study will also assess the demand (and gaps) for the relevant occupations arising across other sectors such as culinary skills. The study will enable SOLAS, ETBs and the FET sector more generally to widen its evidence base to inform the most appropriate type and scale of provision to be funded/provided to meet appropriate Hospitality Sector skill needs up to 2020.<br/><br/>  While Skillnets has no dedicated sectoral network operating in the restaurant &amp;amp; hospitality sector since 2010, a significant majority of Skillnets networks are mixed-sectoral, and many of whom count hospitality businesses among their membership, mostly hotels &amp;amp; restaurants. <br/><br/>  Skillnets are currently planning the early stages of a New Open Call for Proposals in 2015 .  As in previous New Open Calls, this process will involve contact with all previous applicants and the identification of sectoral gaps such as in the hospitality sector to identify key stakeholders and advise them of funding opportunities</p></reply>

This is a very stark reality, which, unfortunately, means that changes to any public service, including the student grant scheme, cannot be ruled out.<br/><br/>  For this reason it is the responsibility of Government to take into consideration all areas of public services when formulating Budget 2015.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.<br/><br/>Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <br/><br/>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <br/><br/>  The Deputy has not included details of the school currently attended by the child in question and so I cannot ascertain where he may be in this process.<br/><br/>  I would advise, in the first instance, that if the parents of the child have specific concerns about his educational progress that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. <br/><br/>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.<br/><br/>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.

Schools have autonomy in relation to the deployment of classroom teachers to individual classes. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds. In addition, a staffing appeals process is available to schools, including a new criterion for the 2014/15 school year which is aimed at schools which make a significant contribution to absorbing demographic growth.</p><p>  The context for any discussion about class sizes is that my Department, like all other Government Departments, is operating within a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis. This budgetary programme has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing some economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth that will enable us to move to a point in future budgets where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR and class size. </p><p>  In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers across primary, post-primary and third level.</p></reply>

They must also have an appropriate technical and pedagogical qualification prior to delivering any element of a Training Course<br/><br/>Pedagogical qualification minimum requirement:<br/><br/>The Tutor's qualification must have comprised a minimum of 110 hours of learning, of which a minimum of 24 hours must be face-to-face tutored.<br/><br/>The content of the course must have included elements covering:<br/><br/>- Planning for training <br/><br/>- Training Needs Analysis<br/><br/>- The trainer role <br/><br/>- Motivation <br/><br/>- Communication <br/><br/>- Training methods<br/><br/>- Evaluation and assessment <br/><br/>- Quality assurance in training and education <br/><br/>- Equality issues in training<br/><br/>  Pedagogical experience minimum requirement:<br/><br/>  The Tutor must have post qualification experience delivering training to learners over a period of time totalling 2 years or more of direct learner contact time or the Tutor must be the subject of a development plan by the Contractor that includes monthly evaluation by an Evaluator for the duration of the course. <br/><br/>Professional qualification and experience minimum requirements:<br/><br/>The Tutor must hold a recognised qualification in the particular discipline at least 1 level above (equivalent to the National Framework of Qualifications) the module or overall course certification that is being delivered and have at least 2 years related professional experience in the discipline or the Tutor must hold a recognised qualification in the particular discipline at the same level (equivalent to the National Framework of Qualifications) and have a minimum of 4 years related professional experience in the discipline or where no recognised professional qualification exists for the course, the Tutor must have a minimum of 7 years related experience in the discipline.<br/><br/>This requirement is the same for all types of courses including IT programmes. The type of related professional experience does not exclude voluntary work. <br/><br/>It is essential that the tutors are able to relate real life experience during their delivery of the material and therefore academic qualifications without experience are insufficient to deliver effective training to the client group.</p></reply>

Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school, whereas for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for. <br/><br/>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.<br/><br/>In primary schools, additional teaching supports for pupils with special education needs are provided through two channels. <br/><br/>Under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, schools are resourced to cater for pupils whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category. All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs. <br/><br/>Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<br/><br/>Details of the NCSE application criteria are available at www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.<br/><br/>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. <br/><br/>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <br/><br/>I would advise, in the first instance, that if the parents of the child have specific concerns about his educational progress or are dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school, they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school,with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist and/or their local SENO.<br/><br/>Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<br/><br/>The availability of Health related services are a matter for the HSE and questions relating to such services can be addressed to my colleague the Minister for Health. </p></reply>

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period. It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47m pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015. Some 17 Women&rsquo;s Projects under the remit of the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks (NCCWN) currently receive annual funding of &euro;1.3 million under the LCDP. In addition, <b>my Department also supports a number of Women&rsquo;s projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO). This funding scheme, which supports national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, aims to provide multi-annual funding towards core costs associated with the provision of services. A new round of funding under this scheme commenced on 1 July 2014, under which the NCCWN  </b>was allocated some &euro;160,122 for the two year period of 1July 2014 &ndash; 30 June 2016.<br/><br/><b>The S</b>ICAP is one of my key priorities and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process. The Programme&rsquo;s target groups are:<br/><br/>-Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas<br/><br/>-  Lone Parents<br/><br/>-  New Communities (including Refugees/Asylum Seekers)<br/><br/>-  People living in Disadvantaged Communities<br/><br/>-  People with Disabilities<br/><br/>-  Roma<br/><br/>-  The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)<br/><br/>-  Travellers <br/><br/>-  Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas<br/><br/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway. Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed. Stage two (Invitation to Tender), will get underway in October and will involve the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br/><br/>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications. That said, I understand that some small groups, such as the groups under the remit of the NCCWN, faced a number of challenges in competing in the Stage one process. As soon as the outcome of Stage one is made known, I will be considering the implications of that for NCCWN in the context of the relevant SICAP target groups.</p></reply>

However, the Government has agreed to provide additional funding to Irish Water for their capital investment to include a free first fix scheme.  Irish Water has submitted its water charges plan, including its proposed capital investment plan, to the CER .As part of the plan, Irish Water has suggested that customers are capped at the relevant unmetered charge for an initial period after their water meter is installed. This will ensure that those with meters installed, and an identified leak external to the dwelling, will not be penalised pending the carrying out of the first fix.The CER has recently completed a public consultation and is currently reviewing submissions received on their consultation documents.The CER will make their determination on the water charges plan later this monthand details of the approved plan will be announced shortly. <br/><br/>In the past week, Irish Water has submitted a draft first fix policy to the CER for approval. It is understood that the CER intend to hold a public consultation in advance of a decision and implementation of this scheme in January 2015. <br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email to or by telephone on 1890 278 278. </p></reply>

The Personal Public Services (PPS) numbers will be used by Irish Water to ensure that each household receives the free allowance it is entitled to, as well as any additional allowance for children in receipt of Child Benefit at that address. It will also facilitate Irish Water in providing reduced charges to owners who have unoccupied dwellings.   </p><p>  Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, and is therefore permitted to request PPS numbers to authenticate the identity of the person being provided with an allowance. Irish Water will treat applicants&rsquo; personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that its data protection notice is fully compliant with Data Protection requirements and that it is in regular contact with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure this is the case. Irish Water has also confirmed that no data will be stored outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), and Irish Water will not sell any customer data. There may be limited instances where Irish Water might need to share information with third parties with whom it has service agreements for operational reasons, e.g. ICT support for systems maintenance, and this will be done under full compliance with all Data Protection requirements. </p></reply>

Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and a copy of the Quarter 2 Progress Report is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above. <br/><br/>The level of funding available to housing authorities in 2015 for housing programmes including homelessness is currently being considered in the context of the Estimates process. In light of budgetary demands, I am working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that appropriate funding priority continues to be attached to homelessness.<br/><br/>In relation to climate change, the Government approved the <i>General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill</i>in April 2014. The Bill, which is listed among the Bills expected to be published during the Autumn Session<b></b>in the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme, is currently being drafted within the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Once the Bill is approved by Government, my objective is to introduce it and progress its passage through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible, with a view to enactment by the end of 2014, as set out in the <i>Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016</i>.<br/><br/>With particular regard to greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, commits Ireland to a long-term vision of low-carbon transition based on, inter alia, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p></reply>

Through the National Broadband Plan (NBP) the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland.  This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.</p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services.  A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department to identify those areas that require a State intervention.  An initial list of areas has already identified and includes 82 areas in County Galway.  I am also aware of extensive rollout of high speed broadband services in Galway by at least one commercial operator. </p><p>  As part of the mapping process, an initial stakeholder consultation on certain technical aspects of the proposed Plan was launched in June with a deadline of 15th September.  31 submissions were received as part of this process and non-commercially sensitive versions of these responses will be published over the coming weeks.</p><p>  I expect to publish the maps for public consultation later this year.  These will include details of the areas requiring State intervention.  It is important to note that these maps will be dynamic and will be subject to change if new commercial investments are announced in the future. </p><p>  A further public consultation on a proposed comprehensive intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015. </p><p>  EU State Aid clearance will be required for the proposed State intervention.  My Department will be working closely with the European Commission on this important aspect of the programme.</p><p>  Finally, a detailed procurement process will have to be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) prior to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services.</p><p>  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and for my Department.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way.  Our goal is to ensure that quality broadband services are available to all citizens regardless of where they are located. </p></reply>

Under these Regulations<i>, </i>a person may apply to the appropriate<i></i>local authority for the issue of a permit authorising the use of any particular vehicle or combination of vehicles, the use of which would contravene any of the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 2003 - S.I. No. 5/2003 (as amended), to be used on one or more specified public roads or all public roads within a specified area within the functional area of the relevant local authority. <br/><br/>It should be noted that this permit system is intended for exceptional circumstances and not as an alternative to complying with existing maximum vehicular mass and dimensions legislative requirements. <br/><br/>Last year, the RSA investigated the charging structures in the various local authorities associated with abnormal load permits and found a wide variation in such charges. They also found considerable variation in the administrative procedures operated by local authorities in dealing with applications for abnormal load permits.<br/><br/>I think that this is an area that could benefit from a greater degree of standardisation and stream-lining of administrative procedures and it would be my intention, in consultation with the RSA, to have the existing regulations reviewed in this area. However, given the other priorities which my Department is currently dealing with in the road safety area and the fact that abnormal loads are the exception rather than the rule, it is likely to be next year before we can turn attention to this issue.</p></reply>
