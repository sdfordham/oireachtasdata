    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-29a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042900067#WRA00500"><p>​To date, my Departments's funding initiatives for the delivery of greenways have been open to local authorities only.  Local Authorities have staff in place with the right skills, experience and knowledge to plan and procure cycle projects and can ensure that greenways fit in with the Development and Local Transport plans. They also have, generally, a more robust system of financial controls in place. </p>  <p>  When community groups contact my Department requesting consideration of funding for local initiatives I would normally suggest that they contact their local LEADER group given the role this body plays in providing advice and funding for community ventures. LEADER can then work with the Local Authority to develop plans for a greenway.</p>  <p>  While the current and previous National Cycle Network funding initiatives were solely open to local authorities,  my Department will consider widening future funding calls to include other bodies and community groups.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the interest in providing Greenways is growing substantially throughout the country and far outweighs the funding available to my Department for that purpose. With this limitation in mind the projects which do succeed in being awarded funding must be of a very high standard with robust cost estimates in place, with a business plan that clearly identifies potential users of the greenway and with the potential to deliver a good return for investment.  Cognisance must also be given to how a proposal links into the national cycle network although my Department is open to suggestions as to how this network can evolve over the coming years and this also could provide opportunities to create a role for local communities. </p>  <p>  At the moment I would encourage community groups to continue to work with their local authority and/or LEADER group to develop projects which they feel would contribute to their communities so as to be in a position to avail of future funding opportunities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-29a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015042900067#WRA00800"><p>The draft Framework "Investing in Our Transport Future: A Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport" was published for public and stakeholder consultation in August last. Having considered the submissions made, my Department has finalised the report and I plan to publish the revised final report soon.     </p>  <p>  The Framework concludes that the key challenge with regard to investment in land transport is securing investment levels consistent with maintaining, renewing and improving a transport network that can efficiently support the economic and social needs of the country. Exchequer investment for land transport capital expenditure has fallen from a peak of &euro;3 billion (1.6% of GDP) in 2008 to an historic low level of &euro;850 million (0.5% of GDP in 2014). The long run average of land transport capital formation in Ireland stands at 1.13% of GDP. The International Transport Forum has reported that 2011 OECD average investment levels in land transport were estimated to stand at 1%. This suggests that funding levels of recent years are much lower than the OECD average.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, based on conservative population projections, the Framework estimates that commuting trips are expected to increase by 35% over current levels by 2040-implying at a minimum 650,000 additional daily trips to and from work, expected to arise largely on corridors to and within the principal cities. Without investment to cater for this demand, our main urban centres will become severely congested which will inevitably act as a barrier to economic growth. Recent experience has shown that the right transport projects provide a good return on investment. Detailed economic appraisal of projects is therefore essential to ensure that public money is being put to its most productive use.</p>  <p>  As shown by the Framework, investment levels are not now, nor have they been over recent years, even sufficient to maintain the land transport network in its current state. In that context, the role of rail in meeting transport demand and the cost of maintaining the rail network in its current state was considered. The Framework recommends the development of a new rail policy. Both I and the Steering Group that developed the Framework considered that a new policy needs to have regard to social and environmental considerations uniquely addressed by rail, as well as the economic and investment context established in the Framework. My Department is working with the NTA to progress this proposal. I envisage that a public consultation process will take place in the coming weeks on the current and future role of rail in Ireland. I expect the process to focus on issues such as current usage, transport needs, competition from other modes, wider associated benefits and financial constraints. A key component of new policy will be a focus on where rail's greatest strengths lie.  All of these issues will have to be taken into account in formulating our new rail policy.</p></reply>

A range of potential future scenarios for the future viability and growth of the Airport were considered as part of the Group&rsquo;s deliberations.</p>  <p>  In examining potential future scenarios for the future viability and growth of the Airport, an ambitious approach, involving an optimum level of investment and support of about &euro;36 million, was identified by the Group. Notwithstanding any future Exchequer funding, it was agreed that financial contributions from the local authorities in the region and from the local business sector, must constitute a significant part of the future funding of the Airport.</p>  <p>  The Study Group Report was presented to Government on 16 December 2013, with its recommendations and their impact on future State supports for regional airports, being noted at that time by Government. </p>  <p>  The 2015-2019 Regional Airports Programme, which reflects the recommendations of the Study, provides for the continuation of Exchequer supports under the three main Schemes - Core Airport Management Operational Expenditure Subvention, Capital Expenditure Expenditure Grants and Public Service Obligation air services, where appropriate, to the four regional airports. The Programme limits future Exchequer support to safety and security related infrastructural projects, similar to the policy that has existed for some time.</p>  <p>  The Programme has recently been formally notified to the EU Commission for approval, following which my Department will engage with the four airports to identify the specific level of Exchequer supports to be made available to each airport. </p></reply>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland will be marketing it at home and overseas. Already, at this year&rsquo;s Meitheal trade show, the new proposition has been introduced to overseas buyers and it was very well received.  Marketing expenditure is current rather than capital and overseas marketing of the island of Ireland is an operational matter for Tourism Ireland.  Accordingly I have referred the question to the agency for direct reply.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be working with businesses and communities  to bring the proposition to life, including a series of experience development workshops to assist in the animation of the stories and their locality. There will also be a signage and interpretation programme to bring all the diverse elements of &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; together.</p>  <p>  While it is far too early yet to measure its success, it is a compelling offering and has the potential to welcome significant additional visitors, generating revenue and jobs in rural communities.  Research suggests that Ireland's Ancient East could deliver 600,000 extra overseas visitors and increased revenue of almost 25% to &euro;950m in total by 2020.</p>  <p>  I am confident the initiative will impact positively on Waterford which has such highlights as Lismore, Ardmore, the Copper Coast and the Waterford Viking Triangle - but if it is to reach its potential it will be essential that communities get fully involved. Of course, it is important to recognise that, while local authorities are key partners in tourism, administrative areas are not in themselves tourist destinations.  Communities, at every level, along the Wild Atlantic Way have taken responsibility for playing their part and that is why it has been such a big success to date.</p></reply>

International experience confirms that a range of benefits can accrue from tendering in terms of value for money and service quality. </p><p>As to other models of service procurement, the NTA already maximise their ability under the contracts with the bus companies to encourage service quality and efficiency. The NTA has determined that tendering about 10% of the market presents little, if any, risk to Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s overall operations while giving the opportunity to test market pricing, offer opportunities to improve efficiency and customer service, as well as the possibility, subject to the outcome of the competition, of bringing new operators into the market, and enabling benchmarking.</p><p>Finally, I would point that the procurement process being undertaken by the NTA is not privatisation. NTA have commented on this myth on their website as follows:</p><p><font color="#333333">&quot;In response to on-going concerns expressed publicly, the National Transport Authority wishes to restate the fact that the tendering of bus routes currently in progress is </font><i><font color="#333333">not</font></i><font color="#333333"> &lsquo;privatisation&rsquo; and will </font><i><font color="#333333">not </font></i><font color="#333333">in itself result in fare increases, reduced services or any threat to free travel.</font></p><p><font color="#333333">Privatisation is about transfer of ownership and loss of public control.  This is not the case here at all. The National Transport Authority will specify details of bus services to be delivered &ndash; setting out fares, routes, frequencies, environmental standards, customer service standards &ndash; and will seek submissions from the market on that basis, from any operator, including the current operators Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Authority will also retain control of the vehicles.</font></p><p><font color="#333333">The successful tenderer will operate the specified services in return for an agreed fee, and will remit the collected fare revenues to the NTA.  The NTA will maintain full control over service delivery and standards across all routes &ndash; in exactly the same manner as now applies to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.&quot;</font></p><p><font color="#333333"> </font></p></reply>

In this context, the NRA monitors traffic flows across the national road network and maps and collates collision data on national roads.</p>  <p>  A substantial  upgrade of the M50 was completed in 2010. This resulted in the addition of a third lane in both directions from the M1 to Sandyford and a fourth auxiliary lane in places together with the development of freeflow junctions and the introduction of barrier free tolling.  This major investment has significantly enhanced the capacity of the motorway.  I would also remind the House of the substantial upgrade at Newlands Cross, which allows for a continuous, free-flowing route between the M50 and our the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny. There are no proposals at present for further investment in additional capacity.  </p>  <p>  As outlined to the Deputy in my responses to PQ 10526/15 of 10 March and PQ 6220/15 of 11 February, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads such as the Osberstown Interchange and Sallins Bypass is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  The available funds simply do not match the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain existing road infrastructure or address demands for new road improvement projects.</p></reply>

Within its capital budget the NRA has to prioritise expenditure.</p>  <p>  As I recently indicated to the Deputy in PQ 7526/15 of 19th February on the same issue, priority has to be given to the maintenance and upkeep of existing infrastructure.

In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their certificate expires, an NCT may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of test due date without affecting the expiry date.</p></reply>

To date this year (24 April), there have been 50 fatalities recorded on our roads.  While the number of fatalities is down by 7 on this date last year, each life lost on our roads is a tragedy and a lot of work remains to be done to further reduce the number of fatalities on our roads and we can all play our part in achieving this aim.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of important changes to the law in relation to drink driving offences in our road traffic legislation over the past number of years.  The introduction of Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) has been a very effective intervention to improve road safety.  We have also introduced a reduction in the Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) level for drivers and all drivers involved in road traffic collisions where a serious injury has occurred are now obliged to provide a preliminary breath specimen.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may recall that all convictions for drink driving offences in the District Court carry a mandatory disqualification for a minimum of 6 months.  More serious offences give rise to higher minimum penalties. It is a matter for the Courts to make a disqualification order preventing a person from validly holding a drivers licence for a period of time.  The proposal to automatically suspend the licence of a driver involved in a fatal accident who subsequently fails a breathalyser test in advance of a conviction in Court cannot be considered given the rights of citizens to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of natural justice.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the current system at this time.  However, due to the nature of road traffic legislation and the constantly shifting circumstances, road traffic legislation is always a work in progress.  The Road Traffic Bill 2015 is currently being drafted and the focus will be on strengthening the law in relation to driving under the influence of drugs.  New legislative provisions will allow for An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to test drivers for drugs at the roadside thereby mirroring the established procedures for mandatory roadside testing for alcohol.  This is in addition to the introduction of roadside impairment tests which were introduced late last year which provide An Garda Sioch&aacute;na with an important tool in enforcing the law against drug driving.</p></reply>

However, you will appreciate that the funding difficulties in this scheme are primarily a matter for the Trustees, the companies participating in the scheme, the scheme members and the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Act provides a framework for the regulation and supervision of occupational pension schemes. A number of changes have been made to the Pensions Act in recent years to assist employers and trustees respond to the funding difficulties encountered by many pension schemes. As you are aware the Pensions Act was amended in 2009 and again in 2013 to broaden the options available to trustees of pension scheme in the context of a restructure of scheme benefits.  These changes provided for the sharing of the risk of underfunding in a scheme across all scheme members.  The manner in which these options are exercised is a matter for the trustees of a scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interest of scheme members and beneficiaries. </p>  <p>  I met with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport following the meeting with the deferred IASS Committee to discuss the matters raised by the Committee and specifically the proposals that more funding be made available for the longer serving deferred members.

This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition. The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. </p>  <p>  The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age. Over time, the age for State pension (contributory) was reduced to 66 years. </p>  <p>  While it is hoped that, where appropriate, workers will choose and be able to work to pension age and beyond if that is there choice, it is recognised that for some this is not viable and there are measure to support them in such circumstances. All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.</p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance, there are a number of transitioning provisions applying in the case of people who are aged between 65 and 66. These include the following &ndash;</p>  <p>  - Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  </p>  <p>  - Where the claim of jobseekers benefit recipients claims spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied in the case of the jobseeker&rsquo;s entitlement relating to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year).</p>  <p>  - A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of JB within the past year.</p>  <p>  With reference to the matter of retirement age, there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers, whether they are in the public or private sector.  The Deputy may wish to note that Departments of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government are responsible for the terms and conditions of employment and pensions of civil and public servants, including the age at which they may be required to retire.  I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect individual public servants will reflect their particular employment sector and time of original recruitment.  Where public servants are required to retire at age 65, they will generally qualify for a public service pension, which they can draw from that date.  </p>  <p>  Representations from Mr Matt Carthy MEP were forwarded to the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government for attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of &euro;22 million. This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the Widows Contributory Pension. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than was provided by the bereavement grant:</p>  <p>  - The widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension which is a weekly payment, based on contributions or a means test.</p>  <p>  - The widowed or surviving civil partner grant is a once-off payment of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child. </p>  <p>  - A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, continue in payment for six weeks following a death. </p>  <p>  - Guardian payments where someone is looking after an orphaned child. </p>  <p>  - A special funeral grant of &euro;850 where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses. The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral. However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment. An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial costs. The Department official will also consider if a bereavement grant is available from any other source including former employer, credit union or trade union.</p></reply>

In 2014, the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) commissioned two research reports to explore the policy options required to ensure a sustainable private rented sector into the future. The main report, entitled '<b>Future of the Private Rented Sector',</b>examines the economic, policy and taxation treatment of the rented sector.</p><p>The second report, entitled '<b>Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector'</b>, looks at policy options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector. This report includes an examination of rent regulation regimes in other countries and puts forward a series of policy options in relation to rent stability for consideration, such as:</p><p>- Increasing awareness among landlords and tenants of the PRTB and their rights and obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004;  </p><p>- Introducing tax incentives in relation to Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rent Supplement tenancies;</p><p>- Introducing a rent certainty lease.</p><p>The Government is monitoring the rental market closely and the overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole. Housing policy is a matter for the Department of Environment, and my officials have been in contact with officials in that department and they are keeping the tax policy aspects under review. Any such tax proposals would be considered by the Government as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

The other mobile scanning system is a scanner van, a specialist vehicle incorporating an X-ray facility and radiation detection facilities. It is used for monitoring baggage and cargo at airports and ports for narcotics, cigarettes, radioactive materials and other contraband. It also allows Revenue officers to carry out control actions at other locations such as warehouses and courier depots.</p>  <p>  The mobile scanner systems are complemented by static baggage/parcel scanners at all major ports, airports and postal depots.

A report on the potential of social enterprises to create jobs and to identify the actions required by Government and other relevant bodies and agencies, was commissioned and produced by Forf&aacute;s in July 2013.</p><p>The Forf&aacute;s report recommended the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) to develop and champion the sector. The group was established in October 2013 and is chaired by Minister of State Sean Sherlock. </p><p>The function of this group is to provide a coordinated approach from the Government sector to support the development of social enterprise in Ireland, to develop a policy framework for the provision of these supports and to examine the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s report in greater detail with a view to their implementation. </p><p>The Group also formally engages with the Social Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Task Force (SEETF), as the best representative group of the sector to progress the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s report. Since October 2013, the recommendations being examined by the group cover the areas of Policy Development, Capacity Building, Procurement, Funding and Finance, Developing Leaders, Harnessing Community Support and, Governance.</p><p>The Social Enterprise spectrum ranges from enterprises that are fully supported by the State through to a small number of commercially trading companies. Therefore mapping the sector and identifying the supports required is a challenge for policy makers. </p><p>My Department has no policy responsibility for the social enterprise sector. This lies with Minister Sean Sherlock who chairs the Inter-Departmental Group on Social Enterprise with secretariat support being provided by the Department of Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government. To this end my Department has no specific strategy in relation to social enterprise, however, there are many supports available to all entrepreneurs wishing to start up a business, and those that wish to expand businesses, with a viable commercial element.</p><p><b><i>Progress so far includes:</i></b></p><p><b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme</b></p><p>Support for social enterprises has been included as an element in the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, effective from 1 April 2015.</p><p><b>Social Innovation Fund</b></p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has supported the establishment of a Social Innovation Fund (starting at &euro;10m &ndash; matched 50:50 State/philanthropy) to support the growth of social innovations with the potential for transformative impact on critical social issues facing Ireland, including unemployment and the environment, with funding being provided from the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p><p><b>Local Enterprise Offices</b></p><p>The New Local Enterprise Offices which have been established will act as the first-stop-shop and sign-posting service to any enterprise that is commercially viable and meets the eligibility criteria set down by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation.</p><p><b>Capacity Building/E.U. Funds</b></p><p>The group is exploring mechanisms to develop capacity in the sector and examine how best to access EU funds e.g. the new EU Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) programme has a Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis dedicated to support for access to micro-finance and social entrepreneurship.</p><p><b>Public Procurement</b></p><p>Preliminary research is also being undertaken on the inclusion of social impact clauses in public procurement policy.  </p><p><b>Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA)</b></p><p>The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, published its report in 2014.

By way of background let me say that Atlantic bluefin tuna is a highly regulated species with annual catch limits set by the <i>International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) based on scientific advice. A management plan was put in place by ICCAT in 2007 to address the alarming depletion in stock levels. This resulted in greatly reduced annual catch limits in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic Ocean in an effort to rebuild stocks.</i></p><p>Within the EU, quota shares were allocated over ten years ago to Member States based on track record. Ireland, which did not have a track record of fishing for bluefin tuna, does not have a quota. We have access <i>to a small by-catch quota for Bluefin tuna in our pelagic fisheries only. However, this by-catch quota is also available to other Member States, and cannot be used for recreational and/or sport fisheries.</i></p><p>The unequivocal advice we have received from the EU Commission is that a recreational fishery for bluefin tuna is not legally possible in the absence of a national bluefin tuna quota. We do not have such a quota and it is extremely unlikely that we could obtain one as it would involve reducing the share of the Total Allowable Catch of those Member States that do have quota and for whom bluefin is an important commercial fishery. There would be no support from any quarter for any action by Ireland that might lead to an increase in bluefin mortality.</p><p>My Department has for some time been exploring if there may be a means of securing support at EU and ICCAT level for the introduction of a tag and release scientific scheme. In that context, we have been in correspondence with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR), which has responsibility for angling, and the EU Commission, with regard to the possibility of a tag and release fishing programme for Bluefin that would not impact mortality and would contribute to scientific knowledge. We have also requested that Department&rsquo;s views on the specific proposal received from the Irish Big Game Angling Association in this regard.</p><p>For there to be any possibility of such a tag and release programme, an agreement would first be required within the EU, and then an attempt could be made to change ICCAT rules that would permit a possible tag and release programme.</p><p>However, before any case could be made to the EU Commission, there are a number of legal and technical issues which will require further examination and clarification. For instance, a detailed technical analysis would be required of how such a possible tag and release scheme might work (possible scope of the scheme in terms of seasons and numbers, how fish are handled etc.). It would also be necessary to identify changes that would be required to ICCAT and EU Regulations. My Department will continue to liaise closely with DCENR and relevant stakeholders on this matter to consider who would be in a position to undertake such work, in the first instance.</p></reply>

In Ireland&rsquo;s case, National Exchequer funding brings the total to be spent on RDP schemes in the 2014-2020 period to some &euro;4 billion.</p>  <p>  The total allocation for Agri-Environment and Climate Measures under Measure 10 of the new RDP is made up of a number of elements.  Within this, the allocation for GLAS (incorporating GLAS training and the linked Traditional Farm Building Scheme) is some &euro;1.08bn of EU and national funding.  In addition to this figure, there is a total allocation of some &euro;390 million in respect of transitional funding for previous Agri-environment schemes. In this regard, it is anticipated that many AEOS farmers will join GLAS and where this happens it would be expected that the transitional figure will decrease with a corresponding increase in the GLAS figure.  In addition, the overlap of funding between programming periods is a standard feature of RDP design, and it would be expected that funding from the next RDP period would be allocated to GLAS in much the same way as REPS and AEOS are funded in the new RDP.  This will also be reflected in adjustment of the total spend on GLAS over the lifetime of the scheme.   </p>  <p>  To date over 21,000 applications have been registered on the GLAS online system, of which more than 13,000 have already selected actions. Both figures are increasing daily. It is important to note that applicants do not &lsquo;select&rsquo; actions to qualify for GLAS Plus - the increased payments available under this measure are automatically applied where the annual cost for a farmer of addressing a combination of Tier 1 Priority Environmental Assets (PEAs) exceeds &euro;5,000 per annum. These farmers move into the GLAS Plus category, where the ceiling for annual payment is &euro;7,000. Farmers managing bird PEAs can qualify for GLAS Plus on the strength of their bird PEA alone, without the need for any other PEA, provided of course that they manage enough area of habitat to draw the additional payment.</p></reply>

In that regard I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na places an emphasis on tackling crimes against children as well as proactive cooperation with all relevant Departments, organisations and agencies to improve the safety of children.  Children First National Guidance 2011 is adopted as Garda policy and interaction with Tusla (Child and Family Agency) is an integral part of that policy in relation to all investigations of child abuse, or when child protection issues arise generally.  Special legislative provisions are in place with respect to the giving of evidence by children in certain criminal proceedings and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla personnel have undergone joint and intensive training in specialised skills necessary for interviewing children, including where a child might be particularly vulnerable in some way.  All of these arrangements are kept under ongoing review and any instance of assault or other abuse brought to Garda attention is fully investigated.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the significant legislative measures introduced recently to strengthen child protection including the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Children First Bill 2014.

The youth justice system should be considered in its entirety, from the Garda Diversion Programme through to the Children Courts and the Children Detention Schools. It is not a simple question of choice between diversion, community sanctions and detention. The principles of the Children Act 2001 require the various authorities to apply, incrementally, a series of "filters" or tests to each case where a child comes into conflict with the law.</p>  <p>  The first main filter is the Garda Diversion Programme. Section 18 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, requires that, unless the interests of society otherwise require, any child who has committed an offence and accepts responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour shall be consider for admission to the Programme. The aim of the Diversion Programme, through the network of Juvenile Liaison Officers is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a caution thus diverting the young offender away from the Courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending. The caution may be either a  formal caution, which involves supervision by a JLO or an informal caution, generally with no supervision. The process may also include  involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project. The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and takes into account the needs of the victims. The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to them and their families. In considering whether a young person should be admitted to the Garda Diversion Programme, Section 23(2) of the Children Act sets out that the Director (of the Programme) "shall be satisfied that the admission of the child to the Programme would be appropriate in the best interests of the child and not inconsistent with the interests of society and any victim". </p>  <p>  The second main filter is provided by the non-custodial sanctions available to the Courts, including dismissal under the Probation Act and unsupervised sanctions (fines, disqualification, peace bond, curfew etc.). When dealing with a child charged with an offence, the court also must have due regard to the child's best interests, the interests of the victim of the offence and the protection of society. The next stage involves the Probation supervised sanctions (community service and other community sanctions). Finally, as a last resort, detention may be used.</p></reply>

The initial focus of the Authority has been on the development of the statutory Register of Charities in accordance with the Charities Act 2009.  Some 8,500 CHY charities with tax exemption status have been registered automatically on the Register of Charities.  Any charity established before 16 October 2014 and not automatically registered must apply directly to the Authority for inclusion on the register.  The period within which these charities have to register has recently been extended to 16 April 2016. </p>  <p>  I recently met the Chairman and representatives of the Board and was briefed on the work the Authority has undertaken since its establishment in October last which has included communication with the 8,500 CHY charities with tax exemption status regarding the additional information and legal documentation required to support their registered status; development of an online system for organisations to apply for inclusion in the Register of Charities; provision of information to the charities sector on their obligations and duties under the new regulatory regime; and the continuation of services hitherto provided by the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.</p>  <p>  The range of services to be provided by the Authority will be developed over the period ahead.  These services include the development of an annual reporting framework for registered charities, the development of a monitoring and compliance programme and the development of the investigatory role of the Authority under Part 4 of the Act which has not yet been commenced. The Register, when more advanced, will underpin the investigative and other regulatory work of the Authority. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that sanction was recently granted for the appointment of 10 additional staff for the Authority and these will be put in place as soon as possible. I understand this will enable the Authority to build on the work already completed in relation to the Register of Charities and to make significant progress in developing its monitoring and compliance functions.</p>  <p>  As regards any activities that would prevent charities from accessing CHY and tax exemption status, I should advise that under the Charities Act 2009, the Authority does not have any role in determining CHY or tax exemption status; this is the responsibility of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  Additional information and advice for charities and other stakeholders is available on the Authority's website, www.charitiesregulatoryauthority.ie.</p></reply>

At that time, my Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. </p>  <p>  In England and Wales, for example, difficulties arising in connection with high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003. This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high. Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012. </p>  <p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and overhanging trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort. This is intended to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department.</p>  <p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance. In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person concerned would have to show that an easement existed and that there had been a substantial interference with that right. </p>  <p>  The Mediation Bill is being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is my intention to proceed quickly with enactment of the Bill following its publication later this year. The Bill, while not directly dealing with the issue of high hedges and overhanging trees will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence legal proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings. It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.</p>  <p>  Under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, an owner or occupier of land is required to take all reasonable steps to ensure that trees, shrubs and hedges on land are not a hazard or potential hazard for a person using a public road. The section also provides that where a tree, shrub or hedge is a hazard, or obstructs the safe use of a public road, a road authority may serve notice on the owner or occupier of the land requiring that action such as the felling, cutting or removal of the tree, hedge or shrub be taken within a stated period. In addition, section 58 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 provides that a network operator may, after serving notice on the owner or occupier of the land, lop or cut any tree or shrub which obstructs or interferes with any physical infrastructure of the network operator.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015. This was an important priority for the voluntary youth organisations that have a key role in the provision of quality youth work services for young people. </p><p>Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the voluntary youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning. My Department works closely with the youth sector interests in various fora in developing key initiatives.</p><p>The Youth Work Act 2001 provides for certain arrangements to do with the organisation and administration of youth work policy and provision.<b></b>Since the enactment of the Youth Work Act, in 2001 and the publication of the National Youth Development Plan in 2003, there have been significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services, including the introduction of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department is now developing a National Youth Strategy. The National Youth Strategy will focus on the youth-related policy commitments outlined in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures 2014 - 2020, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.</p><p>The National Youth Strategy is being developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people. A National Youth Strategy Task Group, convened by my Department, is overseeing its development. This Task Group comprises representatives of Government Departments, relevant agencies, business, academia and the voluntary youth organisations. A comprehensive consultation with youth stakeholders, including volunteers and young people on the priorities for the youth strategy has recently concluded. My Department is working to finalise the new National Youth Strategy by early Summer.</p></reply>

As such, the &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; of a project to proceed, and be completed within the timeframe, will be a major consideration when Pobal are reviewing the applications. Applicants that can best demonstrate &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; will be those that:</p>  <p>  a) have obtained full planning permission, or can demonstrate that planning is not required;</p>  <p>  b) have completed an appropriate tendering process where tenders are still in date and valid; and,</p>  <p>  c) have confirmation that project can be completed within the timeframe available.</p>  <p>  Strand 1 funding under the programme, which provides for large scale capital grants, is available to groups who have an opportunity to move their service from an unsuitable building to a more suitable location e.g. where a premises has been made available to the group but will need works to make it suitable for the delivery early years services. This strand of funding is also available to services to undertake major essential refurbishment work in order that their current premises remains fit-for-purpose. In both cases, the works may result in the service having increased capacity on completion of the project. Funding is not available where the sole purpose of the project is to increase the capacity of the service.</p></reply>

The recommendations of the Review Group fall under three headings, namely the establishment of a child death review unit, the operation of the <i>in camera</i>rule and the reform of the child protection system in general. The status in relation to each is set out below.</p><p>The National Review Panel (NRP) for the investigation of serious incidents including the deaths of children in care and known to the child protection system was set up in 2010 as part of the Implementation Plan associated with the <i>Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse</i>(2009) (Ryan Report). The NRP reviews serious incidents involving children known to child welfare and protection services of the Child and Family Agency including the deaths of children in care. The overarching objective of the NRP is to promote learning and best practice from its review of cases with a view to assisting the child welfare and protection system in improving its services and minimising the possibility of similar deaths and/or serious incidents to children and young people using their services. It is considered that this mechanism fulfils the recommendation in relation to child death review units in the ICDRG report. Following the report, it was considered that strengthening the NRP and conducting reviews in accordance with HIQA agreed guidance was the most appropriate way to copperfasten the structures for future reviews. For information, the guidance for the NRP was revised and published last year.</p><p>In response to the recommendation regarding the <i>in camera </i>rule, the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous provisions) Act 2013 amended Section 29 of the Child Care Act 1991 in relation to the <i>in camera</i>rule. In addition, the Child Care Law Reporting Project (CCLRP) was established under the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007, in accordance with the 2012 Regulations made under that Act. The aims and objectives of the project are to:</p><p>- Provide information to the public on child care proceedings in the courts;</p><p>- Conduct research on these proceedings in order to promote debate and inform policy-makers;</p><p>- Make recommendations to address any short-comings in the child care system identified by the research;</p><p>- Assist in the implementation of these recommendations;</p><p>- Promote confidence in the child care system.</p><p>To date the project has published 9 volumes of case reports - 4 volumes each year in 2013 and 2014 and another volume of case reports was published on 1 April 2015. It has also published two interim reports, in November 2013 and October 2014. Both interim reports contain a number of (interim) observations and suggestions, but no recommendations. A final report, with recommendations, will be published in October 2015. </p><p>Significant reform of the child protection system is ongoing.  The Programme for Government commitment to establish the Child and Family Agency reflected significant concern over recent years regarding the protection of children and the response of relevant services, and a determination to align key services into a single, comprehensive, integrated and accountable service delivery system. </p><p>Significant service and organisational improvements have been achieved including: </p><p>- Reformation of the management structure;</p><p>- More equitable distribution of resources;</p><p>- Consistent implementation of Children First;</p><p>- Expanded counselling services;</p><p>- Specialist clinical services for children in special care and detention;</p><p>- The mainstreaming of care placements for separated children seeking asylum;</p><p>- Improved care planning for children in care;</p><p>- A national emergency out of hours placement service;</p><p>- Improved aftercare services;</p><p>- Improved supervision and staff retention strategies.</p></reply>

Every effort is currently being made to fill these vacancies.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, my Department and the HSE are working in collaboration with Beaumont Hospital to ensure that measures are put in place to alleviate current pressures and to address the challenges facing the transplant personnel and the hospital management.</p></reply>

The first phase will be for all children aged under 6 years. This service will commence during the summer. In parallel with this, the second phase will extend universal GP care without fees to all persons aged 70 years and over, subject to the passing of the necessary legislation. These measures represent a major step on the way to universal health care. By this summer, approximately 800,000 people in Ireland will benefit from universal access to GP services.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP service. </p>  <p>  Children under 6 will benefit from a new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract.  This will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and wellbeing and the prevention of disease. The contract will also cover an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma. The costs of the enhanced GP service for all children under 6 years of age will be approximately &euro;67 million. The annual cost of the over-70 year old phase, based on existing GMS GP costs, is estimated at &euro;18 million. </p>  <p>  The additional cost of providing a universal GP service to the entire population was previously estimated at &euro;330m-&euro;365m on the basis of the existing scope of the service, rates of payments to GPs and eligibility. In the absence of specific changes to the scope and content of the GP service, the relevant fee structure or the eligibility rates, it would not be possible for an additional exercise to yield a more valid estimate in respect of the remainder of the population at this point in time.</p></reply>

Given the limited number of surgeons who specialise in transplantation, the filling of any vacancies poses a challenge.  Every effort is currently being made to fill these vacancies. 	</p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital is collaborating with St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in relation to a combined approach to kidney/pancreas transplants, as well as the development of an intra-abdominal organ retrieval service. It is proposed that pancreatic transplants, of which 6 were performed in 2014, will move to St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital this year.  While the transfer of such transplants to St Vincent&rsquo;s has been agreed in principle, it will take some time to make the detailed arrangements to facilitate the commencement of this work. Most pancreas transplants are combined with a kidney transplant.  The arrangements being put in place for such cases will involve transplant surgeons from both St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together on the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus.</p>  <p>  The 9 patients who are on the waiting list for a pancreas transplant are being contacted to reassure them that the pancreatic transplantation programme will continue.</p></reply>

In Ireland&rsquo;s case, we are working closely with our partners in the EU and through the United Nations to coordinate our efforts and to strengthen the tools at our disposal.</p><p>A special meeting of the European Council on 30 August 2014 called for accelerated implementation of a package of measures agreed in June 2013 concerning four priority areas: prevention of radicalization, detection of suspicious travel, investigation and prosecution and cooperation with third countries.</p><p>Counter-terrorism was most recently discussed by Foreign Affairs Council on 19 January and 9 February 2015.  The February Council called for comprehensive action against terrorism in full compliance with international law, fundamental values and international human rights standards.  It decided to step up, as a matter of urgency, external action on countering terrorism and to this end it agreed detailed conclusions under five headings.  These headings concerned: strengthening partnerships with key countries, supporting capacity building, countering radicalisation and violent extremism, promoting international cooperation and addressing underlying factors and ongoing crises.</p><p>Discussions by Foreign Ministers on external measures are complemented by those of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers on internal EU security.  The issue has featured regularly on the agenda of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.  Following their meeting in Riga on 29 and 30 January 2105, JHA Ministers issued a joint statement with wide ranging conclusions on measures to prevent and combat terrorism.  </p><p>The informal European Council on 12 February 2015 took account of the discussions and conclusions of the February FAC and the Riga statement.  In their statement, EU Heads of State and Government set out a range of priorities to guide further work by both Council formations.  These priorities were set out under three headings: ensuring the security of citizens, preventing radicalisation and safeguarding values, and cooperating with our international partners.</p><p>These measures at EU level are consistent with the approach set out in UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014) which 104 States, including Ireland, co-sponsored last September in New York.  This Resolution urges that all countries actively commit to countering the radicalisation, recruitment and participation of their citizens as foreign terrorist fighters in the conflict zones of Syria and Iraq.  </p><p>The Resolution takes a comprehensive, human rights compliant approach to tackling the foreign fighters problem in accordance with international law.  It highlights the need to tackle the underlying causes of radicalisation through community outreach initiatives, while at the same time focusing on strengthening legal and security measures.  This comprehensive strategy in the Resolution is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the issue.</p><p>Ireland also participated actively in New York in June 2014 in the Fourth Review of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which reiterated that terrorism is unacceptable in all its forms, requiring practical steps to prevent and combat it. Those practical steps include measures ranging from strengthening state capacity to counter terrorist threats to better coordinating United Nations system&rsquo;s counter-terrorism activities.  </p><p>Where possible, Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities. We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.</p><p>Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address<i></i>the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.</p></reply>

The main focus of the resolution was the establishment of an ad hoc committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism.</p>  <p>  At the time of the vote, the EU set out the position agreed by all Member States, explaining that it had made extensive efforts and engaged in the process in good faith.  The EU reiterated the considerations outlined at the outset of negotiations, as follows:  </p>  <p>  &ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use. Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.</p>  <p>  The ad-hoc committee should reflect the recent and ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring undertaken in the IMF, subject to the previous considerations, and should take place in close coordination with and with technical support from the Fund.  Discussions should also make reference to the work in other fora on these issues, such as the Paris Club, which has a history of discussing sovereign debt restructuring issues.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In the event, the resolution continued to propose the elaboration of a new legal framework.  In these circumstances, the agreed EU position is that we will not be participating in the work of the committee, which takes place at official level.</p>  <p>  Ireland together with our EU partners and other UN member States is actively engaged in ongoing processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring. We consider that the work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July, offers more appropriate and established means for meaningful dialogue on the matter. We will play our full role in working for the success of the Financing for Development Conference in Addis, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.  These major international negotiations at the UN are being co-chaired by Ireland and Kenya. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support processes aimed at resolving global debt issues through dialogue, in the most appropriate forum and using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms to support the countries most seriously affected.</p></reply>

This addresses the unions' stated core objection to the previous reform proposals.</p><p>His proposal creates a clear distinction between the State certified terminal examination, which will continue to be run by the State Examinations Commission, and school based assessment, which will be separately conducted by teachers and reported on directly by schools to parents.</p><p>We must accept that State Examinations cannot provide information about the considerable range of skills and abilities that we want to encourage and reward in our young people. This dual approach to assessment at junior cycle  will give a more balanced view of students' achievements.</p><p>The reform opens recognition of different forms of assessment.</p><p>Some elements of assessment will happen at school level every day between the teacher and their students. Others will be reported more formally to parents and students at designated times, while still others will happen through the final State examination.</p><p>In relation to school based assessment, all that teachers are being asked to do, for any subject, is to judge a student's performance on a maximum of two events and to report these judgements to parents and students.</p><p>The greatest benefits for students' learning occur when teachers and students provide really effective feedback to each other.</p><p>Giving students meaningful feedback about their learning is essential, if learning is to be effective.</p><p>This two way relationship, between the student and their teacher, has to be nurtured throughout the three years of junior cycle.</p><p>The Travers document recognises that teachers need to be supported in carrying out this assessment role.  I fully endorse that.</p><p>Teachers will be supported to ensure that their judgements are in line with national standards.</p></reply>

This is the same level of examination fee increase which has applied to the fees generally for Leaving Certificate candidates.</p>  <p>  Special examination entry fees for repeat candidates were introduced in 1987 on the basis that it is not unreasonable to expect those who have already benefited from the normal course of free second level education to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources.</p>  <p>  Examination entry fees generally cover only a fraction of the cost of running the examinations. Additional demands on the system have been arising in recent years due to the introduction of new methods of assessment in various subjects and to continuing increases in special arrangements for students with special needs.</p>  <p>  There is an alleviation scheme in place whereby candidates or their parent/guardian who have been awarded a full medical card are exempt from the payment of examination entry fees.

In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height.</b></p><p><b>The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012 suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation &ndash; which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes - rather than through the Courts.  In this regard, I understand that the Minister for Justice proposes to publish a Mediation Bill during 2015. Such mechanism, when introduced, should assist in </b><i>speeding up the resolution of civil disputes of this nature, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.</i></p></reply>

If a person takes up this option, proceedings are discontinued and the person need not attend.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the "third payment option" is a complex project involving my Department, An Garda Siochana, the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, the Courts Service and the Attorney General's Office. Implementation is currently planned for mid to late 2016.</p></reply>

In this context, the NRA monitors traffic flows across the national road network and maps and collates collision data on national roads.</p>  <p>  A substantial  upgrade of the M50 was completed in 2010. This resulted in the addition of a third lane in both directions from the M1 to Sandyford and a fourth auxiliary lane in places together with the development of freeflow junctions and the introduction of barrier free tolling.  This major investment has significantly enhanced the capacity of the motorway.</p>  <p>  I would also remind the Deputy of the substantial upgrade at Newlands Cross, which allows for a continuous, free-flowing route between the M50 and our the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny. </p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads such as the Naas/Newbridge/Sallins Bypass is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  The available funds simply do not match the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain existing road infrastructure or address demands for new road improvement projects.</p></reply>

It found that Diesel prices are more expensive in Ireland than in the euro area and that while the cost of many transport services in Ireland has remained stable, air transport prices had increased over the previous year. It also found that it is more expensive (excluding tariffs) to export and import to and from Ireland by sea but that Irish administrative processes are efficient and compare favourably with processes in our key competitors.  The Report is being considered by my Department.    </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, my Department continues to seek to introduce measures to improve competitiveness. The National Ports Policy approved by Government in 2013 has as its core objective the facilitation of a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services and actions to implement the Policy are already underway.  The Government's aviation policy has and continues to favour competition. My Department invests heavily in our rail and road transport infrastructure, albeit at a lower level than previously, and to look at other means of reducing costs to the sectors, such as the fuel rebate scheme introduced by my Colleague the Minister for Finance for licensed transport operators, and the new online licensing system for road transport operators, both designed to reduce costs to the industry.</p></reply>

It is an EU-wide network of nature protection areas established under the 1992 Habitats Directive. The aim of the network is to assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats. It is comprised of special areas of conservation (also referred to as sites of community importance in the EU context) designated by Member States under the Habitats Directive and special protection areas which are designated under the 1979 Birds Directive. The establishment of this network of protected areas also fulfils a Community obligation under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>  <p>  Following the public advertising of the intention by Ireland to designate 429 special areas of conservation, those sites were transmitted to, and subsequently adopted by, the European Commission as sites of community importance or European sites. Legal protections, consummate with those set out in the Habitats Directive, have applied to the sites since initially proposed for designation and Ireland&rsquo;s planning and environmental legislation has operated under these designations. </p>  <p>  There are two Natura 2000 designations on Howth Head &ndash; the Howth Head special area of conservation and the Howth Head Coast special protection area. </p>  <p>  Howth Head was initially proposed for designation as a special area of conservation in July 1999 with the specific intention to protect and preserve the selected habitats of dry heath and vegetated sea cliffs that are particular to this location. The site is also of scientific importance for its seabird colonies, invertebrates and lichens. It also supports populations of at least two legally protected plant species and several other scarce plants. </p>  <p>  Howth Head Coast was initially proposed for designation as a special protection area in May 2008 and is of high ornithological importance, as it supports a nationally important population of Kittiwake.  It is also a traditional nesting site for Peregrine Falcon, a species that is listed in Annex I of the Birds Directive.  It has been formally designated as a special protection area by Statutory Instrument since 2012 (S.I. 185/12).</p>  <p>  The protections under the Birds and Habitats Directives ensure that no plan or project undertaken in the area or vicinity of any special area of conservation or special protection area can be commenced without prior consultation with my Department and an appropriate assessment of the likely impacts on the habitats and species protected by the designations.</p></reply>
