In addition to providing certainty, it also eases the administration burden on the homeowner by not having to revalue their houses each year.  </p><p>  The regular revaluation periods ensure that the property register is maintained with accurate and up to date information to assist in evaluating the operation of LPT, as well as bringing newly built properties within the scope of LPT.  The Deputy may be aware that under the LPT legislation, where a property is not a &quot;relevant residential property&quot; on a valuation date (i.e. not liable to LPT), with certain exceptions, that property will not be a relevant residential property until the next valuation date. In the interests of equity to compliant LPT payers it is important to have regular valuation dates so that newly built properties are brought into the LPT net. It also provides certainty to those homeowners as to when they will become liable to LPT. </p><p>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid from 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2016, and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, including repairs or improvements made, during this period. I also committed not to amend the central national rate of LPT for the lifetime of the Government.  </p><p>  While I am very conscious of the concerns of homeowners over increasing property prices and the effects this will have on their LPT liabilities, particularly in urban areas, the next valuation date is not until 1 November 2016. In advance of that date, in conjunction with my officials, I will be examining the LPT and impacts on LPT liabilities due to increasing property prices.</p></reply>

My reply to Question No. 312 of 4 November 2014 (Re. 41524/14) is also relevant.  </p><p>  The Deputy may be referring to refusals in the case of sub-contractors where there is possible misclassification of employment (i.e. a &quot;bogus&quot; self-employment).  I am advised that as details of contract offers are not normally available at RCT registration stage, it is not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to make any determination at that point as to the nature or status of any contract, and in these circumstances Revenue is not in a position to refuse any applications for registration on these grounds. </p><p>  There are safeguards, which have been designed into the electronic RCT system, for those individuals who may have concerns that they are caught up in &quot;bogus self-employment&quot;.  Firstly, a principal contractor has a statutory obligation to notify Revenue through the electronic RCT system of details of all contracts entered into with a sub-contractor and secondly, on receipt of these contract details, Revenue issues a &quot;Contract Confirmation&quot; letter directly to the individual who is described by the principal as being the sub-contractor.  On receipt of the &quot;Contract Confirmation&quot; letter, a sub-contractor is obliged to notify Revenue if they believe that they are not a sub-contractor but are more correctly an employee and Revenue will take the necessary steps to investigate the matter. </p><p>  Revenue is very active in visiting construction sites through its Joint Investigation Units, whose work includes conducting joint operations with officers from NERA and the DSP.  One project that Revenue has a strong focus on is the Department of Education and Skills Capital Programme.  Revenue staff have been involved in over 70 visits to such sites since January 2012 and this work is on-going.</p><p>  A second additional recent, and on-going, Dublin Region project reviewed 18 publicly funded construction sites ranging in contract size from &euro;1m to &euro;400m, on which in excess of 300 contractors were identified (including approximately 40 non-resident contractors).  Following risk assessment, 51 audits and 20 risk management interventions were opened and to date, 34 audits and all 20 risk management interventions have been completed, with a yield of &euro;749,476. Some non-resident contractors were also appraised and, as a result, a number of audit interventions were opened. </p><p>  Issues encountered during audit interventions ranged from non-operation (or non-reporting) of the electronic RCT system, inaccurate posting of contracts and payments and workers being paid in cash without any supporting documentation, i.e. payslips, P45s on cessation, etc.  </p><p>  The Joint Revenue/Department of Social Protection Investigation Unit teams also conducted 30 unannounced visits, concentrating on construction projects with contract values in excess of &euro;5m. A total of 817 workers were interviewed of which 128 (15%) had compliance issues which are being addressed.  Issues encountered were, in the main, employees that had not been registered with Revenue.  The team is currently engaged with 5 sub-contractors who have misclassification (i.e. bogus self-employment) issues with their workers. </p><p>  The conclusion reached at the interim report stage of this project is that the electronic RCT system has helped to significantly mitigate an area of historically high risk, although some practices including 'cash payments' to employees have persisted. </p><p>  In conclusion, RCT is designed to ensure tax compliance in the construction and certain other sectors. The question of bogus self-employment in the sector is multi-faceted and is a subject of review by the Department of Social Protection in respect of PRSI, both contributions and benefits, and by NERA in relation to employment rights as well as Revenue in relation to tax issues.  It is important to recognise that a legitimate feature of the construction and certain other sectors is the use of sub-contactors.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-03a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120300068#WRA01000"><p>Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) are UK tax advantaged share option schemes designed to help small, higher risk companies to recruit and retain employees.  EMI options can be granted by independent trading companies with gross assets not exceeding &pound;30 million. </p><p>  Options over shares with an unrestricted market value (UMV) at the date of grant up to &pound;250,000 can be granted.  I understand that there will normally be no income tax or National Insurance Contributions when the options are exercised.</p><p>  There is no approval process or clearance mechanism for EMI, but a simple requirement on companies to notify HMRC within 92 days of when an EMI option is granted.  In addition, I understand that there is also an annual reporting requirement. This scheme is a form of State Aid, and as a result many trades are excluded.</p><p>  I do not consider the scheme to be a threat to investment in Irish SMEs. This Government fully supports employee financial participation and provides several schemes to encourage employees to take a share in their employing company, which are not subject to the same limits as the UK scheme.</p><p>  In Ireland, Revenue Approved Profit Sharing Schemes provide a mechanism whereby a company may allocate shares to its employees.  Under an approved scheme an employee may be allocated shares up to a maximum annual value of &euro;12,700.  The employee is, subject to certain conditions, exempt from the income tax charge that would otherwise arise.  Employee PRSI and USC are, however, chargeable. The participant may be liable to capital gains tax when he/she sells the shares if the disposal proceeds exceed the market value of the shares at the date of allocation and if the total gains are large enough to attract liability. </p><p>  Since the legislation was introduced in 1982 Revenue has approved 566 schemes although not all are currently active. The estimated cost of approved profit sharing schemes in 2011, the most recent year for which figures are available, is &euro;25.1 million. This relates to 34,477 employees receiving shares worth &euro;81.4 million.</p><p>  Savings-Related Share Option Schemes provide a mechanism whereby a company may allocate discounted shares to its employees.  An employee is, subject to certain conditions, exempt from the income tax charge on the amount of the discount on the shares allocated to him/her. </p><p>  There are two elements to a scheme:</p><p>(a) A save-as-you earn certified contractual savings scheme, and</p><p>(b) An approved share option scheme.</p><p>  Under the terms of an approved Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, employees are given the right to purchase company shares at a pre-determined price.  The employee enters a savings contract and makes contributions to a certified contractual savings scheme with a qualified savings institution for a designated period of time.  At the end of the savings period the employee can exercise his/her option to acquire shares by using the monies saved over the savings period.  If an employee chooses to exercise his option to acquire shares and the option price is less than the market value of the shares at exercise, the gain/discount is exempt from the charge to income tax.  Employee PRSI and USC are, however, chargeable.</p><p>  Since the legislation was introduced in 1999 Revenue has approved 162 schemes although not all are currently active. The estimated cost of these schemes in 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available, is &euro;2.6 million which relates to the exercise of 1,942 options at a market value of &euro;20.7 million.</p><p>  Many companies offer other forms of share based remuneration to employees.  Apart from the two tax-advantaged schemes already mentioned, all other forms of share based remuneration are subject to Income Tax, PRSI and USC either at source, through the PAYE System, or under Self Assessment.  There is no obligation on a Company to notify Revenue of the existence of a share scheme in operation in a company and consequently there are no statistics available in relation to either the number of companies offering share schemes or the number of employees availing of them. As there is no tax relief available for such schemes there is no cost associated with the operation of such schemes.</p><p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the R&amp;amp;D tax credit which is an important corporation tax support for companies in Ireland.  The central purpose of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit is to encourage companies to undertake high-value add R&amp;amp;D activity in Ireland, thereby supporting jobs and investment here.  </p><p>  There is an element of the credit, known as the &quot;Key Employee&quot; provision, which was introduced in Finance Act 2012 and allows a company to transfer the tax-free benefit of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit to employees who meet certain conditions.   </p><p>  The purpose of the measure is to assist companies, particularly small and medium sized companies, to attract and retain key talent   i.e. individuals with the requisite skill and experience to work in the field of R&amp;amp;D in the State.  This is a particularly flexible element of the credit that is unique to Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-03a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120300068#WRA01200"><p>Regarding the annual tax revenue collected and tax refunds relating to Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) between 2008 and 2014, figures have been provided to me by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, I would like to provide some additional detail to the Deputy regarding RCT generally and the figures supplied. <br/><br/>Firstly, the Deputy will be aware that the primary purpose of the RCT regime is not to generate significant tax yield for the Exchequer.  Instead it provides a mechanism to address tax compliance risks in certain sectors where the practice of sub-contracting activities is a significant feature of the operational model in the sector.  Under RCT, tax deductions at source may apply to payments made in relation to contracts in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors.<br/><br/>Secondly, where amounts are deducted at source from contract payments made by a principal contractor, these tax deducted amounts are generally not repaid but are instead available for offset by sub-contractors against other tax liabilities that they may have. <br/><br/>As the Deputy has requested information for the period 2008 to 2014, this period covers both the original paper-based Relevant Contracts Tax system and its successor, the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax system, which came into effect on 1 January 2012.  Depending on whether a contract payment was made under the current or the previous system, there are differences in when deduction at source applies and in the quantum of any such deduction.<br/><br/>Prior to the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax system in 2012, principal contractors were obliged to deduct tax at 35% on all payments to sub-contractors unless the sub-contractor had a C2 certificate and certain other documentation which allowed the principal to make contract payments gross to the sub-contractor.  At times, this resulted in excessive amounts of tax being withheld which required sub-contractors to claim refunds of these overpayments.  This could be done annually at income tax filing time, or at any time during the tax year as interim refunds were a feature of the old system.<br/><br/>With the electronic RCT system, a sub-contractor is assigned a deduction rate of 0% if their tax affairs are fully compliant, 20% if their tax affairs are substantially compliant, or 35% where the sub-contractor is significantly non-compliant.  <br/><br/>Since the introduction of the new electronic RCT system, the practice of claiming refunds does not generally arise as the new system automatically assigns  a credit of all tax deducted  by principals against the sub-contractors income tax liability and so the figures for repayments includes amounts that have been offset against other tax balances.  There are no interim repayments under the eRCT system. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>RCT Gross  - &euro;m</th><th>RCT Repayments/Offsets -  &euro;m</th><th>RCT Net  - &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>826.7</td><td>894.0</td><td>-67.3</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>436.5</td><td>490.3</td><td>-53.9</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>312.4</td><td>321.7</td><td>-9.3</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>267.3</td><td>273.4</td><td>-6.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>174.3</td><td>171.9</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>157.0</td><td>144.7</td><td>12.3</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (to end October 2014)</td><td>167.1</td><td>139.5</td><td>27.6</td></tr></table>As the Deputy will note from the figures, under the old system pre-2012 it was possible for more monies to be repaid/offset than were collected where a principal contractor did not pay over RCT deducted at source.  This particular risk area has been greatly mitigated since the electronic RCT system was introduced as it provides the Revenue Commissioners with the facility to monitor RCT activity in realtime, to identify risks and to intervene early in cases with the highest risk of evasion. <br/><br/>It has also succeeded in taking away the vulnerabilities for fraud, mainly extraction fraud, based on bogus contractors and bogus documentation that attached to the previous paper-based RCT system. This is a critical feature of the electronic RCT system. The previous paper-based system was exploited by criminal gangs with extraction repayment frauds using bogus deduction cards and bogus sub-contractors to obtain significant fraudulent claims. The electronic RCT system has been designed to remove the opportunity to extract fraudulent claims from the Exchequer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-03a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120300068#WRA01400"><p>My Department and I actively monitor the evolving situation with regard to mortgages arrears.  The Government is very aware of the difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage commitments and has a clear strategy to support households in arrears.  The Government published the Report of the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group in October 2011 (commonly known as the Keane Report) and the key recommendations of that Report have been adopted by Government as the most appropriate framework to address this problem.  The implementation of this strategy is overseen at Government level by the Construction 2020, Housing, Planning and Mortgage Arrears sub-committee which is chaired by the Taoiseach.</p><p>  As part of the strategy, lenders were encouraged to develop practical solutions tailored to individual circumstances for people in the most difficulty with their mortgage.  In that regard, in March 2013, the Central Bank published the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets - or what is commonly known as the MART framework.  This set out performance targets for mortgage arrears resolutions for six mortgage lenders.  These six are AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, KBC Bank Ireland and ACC.  My Department also publishes data on a monthly basis on mortgage restructures and arrears for these six main banks.  </p><p>  In addition, Irish financial services legislation, including Codes issued by the Central Bank of Ireland, provide strong protections to borrowers when dealing with regulated lenders. In particular, for borrowers facing financial difficulty on mortgages, the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears ( the &quot;CCMA&quot;) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. </p><p>  The CCMA applies to the mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except credit unions, operating in the State, including, inter alia, a financial services provider authorised, registered or licensed in another EU or EEA Member State and which has provided, or is providing, mortgage lending activities in the State. The sale of a loan book by a regulated entity to an unregulated entity does not require Central Bank approval. Only certain lending activities are required to be regulated. </p><p>  However, the Government is committed to bring forward legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold.  In July and August, the Department of Finance ran a public consultation seeking views on this proposed legislation.  Nineteen submissions were received from a range of respondents including consumer groups, the financial services industry, public representatives and individuals.  The submissions are accessible on the Department's website.  Officials in my Department have carefully considered these submissions and are working with the Office of the Attorney General to progress this legislation.  My officials will meet with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform later today on this issue.  It is anticipated that the legislation will be published by the end of the year.</p></reply>

I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so. </p><p>  The improvement in the public finances coupled within increased economic growth and rising employment which have followed from our prudent management of the economy has allowed me to make good on our commitment to ease the burden of taxation.</p><p>  The reduction in the higher rate of income tax from 41% to 40%, the extension of the standard rate band at which people begin to pay the higher rate of income tax, and the changes to the USC rates will take effect from next month onwards. The effect of these measures will see all those who currently pay income tax and or USC receive an increase in their take home pay.</p><p>  As I said on Budget Day and since, if the economic and fiscal space allow, we will continue with this approach to personal taxation in subsequent Budgets.</p><p>  However, on the matter of further tax reductions prior to next year's Budget, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that there would be significant administrative difficulties in making changes to tax rates or bands mid-year.  The last mid-year change in a rate band was when the income levy was introduced by the previous Government in 2009.  This required Revenue to calculate a &quot;Composite rate&quot; made up of percentages of the rates before and after the changeover date which was applied on review.   A composite rate has serious implications for the operation of the cumulative system of deduction under PAYE.  It introduces additional complexity to the reconciliation of tax deducted throughout the year with the end of year P35.  This can lead to significant underpayments where employers fail to implement on time and this leads to collection issues in the subsequent year. </p><p>  It would also create problems for payroll operators, impacting software providers and those in smaller businesses where manual payroll systems are used, thus adding an unnecessary administrative burden to business.</p><p>  A change like this could also incentivise income shifting as those taxpayers who could do so, may seek to ensure that the more beneficial rates of tax are applied to their income, depending on when the tax is paid.     </p><p>  Finally, a mid-year change to the standard rate band would require the passage of a money bill by the D&aacute;il.  </p><p>  It is important to note however, that the income tax measures introduced in Budget 2015 are the first stage of a three-year plan to progressively reduce the marginal tax rate on low and middle income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.</p></reply>

In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are also undertaking  investigation in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This includes sharing of information and intelligence and intensive monitoring of the situation.</p><p>  In addition, as part of its routine compliance work Revenue actively monitor the mineral oil sector through analysis of monthly Return of Oil Movements and supply chain data. Any anomalies or breaches of Regulations detected are fully investigated as a matter of course.  </p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy I am satisfied the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible actions to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud including, where possible,  pursuing prosecutions against offenders.</p><p>   </p></reply>

I thank her for bringing this matter to attention again and I want to reassure her, and those homeowners affected, that this issue is receiving attention.  </p><p>  It is important that any changes that may be made do not go beyond the objectives of providing a temporary exemption for homes with &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; only. As I have advised on many occasions in the past, a liability to LPT should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate of the tax to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.</p><p>  Pending any decisions in relation to the statutory provisions, Revenue has an obligation to act in accordance with section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) which requires that an LPT exemption can only apply where the residential property has been assessed and a certificate confirming &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; has been issued. </p><p>  In assessing the value of their property for LPT for May 2013 homeowners whose property is affected by pyrite would have factored this into the valuation. In effect, the presence of pyrite in an estate would have had an impact on the valuation of properties in the estate. </p><p>  As regards correspondence to householders, I am advised by Revenue that as part of its 2015 pay and file campaign for LPT it issued letters in October to just under one million property owners who paid their 2014 LPT charge in a lump sum or who made regular cash payments, asking them to select a payment method for 2015.  These owners, who paid their 2014 LPT in a lump sum, or who made regular cash payments, need to tell Revenue how they will pay their 2015 LPT charge. </p><p>  Property owners wishing to spread their payments over the course of 2015 were required to confirm their payment method by 25 November 2014. Owners who opt to pay their 2015 LPT in full by cheque, postal order, cash, debit card or credit card should make their payment on or before 7 January 2015. Owners who opt to pay their 2015 LPT by Single Debit Authority should confirm this payment method to Revenue on or before 7 January 2015, however, the payment will not be deducted from their current account until 21 March 2015.</p></reply>

These measures are subject to approval from the European Commission. Hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation will remain eligible for a further 3 years and the operating and managing of nursing homes will be included for 3 years.<br/><br/>My officials will be notifying the European Commission of these changes to the EII once the measures in the Finance Bill have been enacted and it is hoped that approval will follow shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>Section 597A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for CGT entrepreneur relief as introduced by Budget 2014 and Section 45 of the Finance (No 2) Act 2013. The relief was introduced subject to European Commission approval and discussions and exchanges have been taking taken place with the European Commission on that issue.<br/><br/>Arising from those discussions, a number of changes are being made in Finance Bill 2014 to the CGT entrepreneur relief provisions in order that the relief would satisfy the EU Commission's new General Block Exemption Regulations introduced earlier this year, thus obviating the need for formal EU approval of the relief from a State-aid perspective.<br/><br/>The changes involve targeting the relief at individuals involved in newly created enterprises or enterprises created within the last 7 years, placing a cap of &euro;15 million on the total risk finance investment made in each such enterprise and ensuring that the risk finance investment is made by the entrepreneurs at the commencement of the new business.<b></b>Other changes are also being made to the relief to make it more compatible with the commercial reality of conducting business on the ground.<br/><br/>The revised provisions of Section 597A (as included in section 52 of Finance Bill 2014 as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann) will be effective from the passing of that Bill.

The recovery in employment began in 2012 and by the third quarter of this year we have seen eight successive increases in employment with over 80,000 more jobs in the economy than at the low point just over two years ago. </p><p>  The recovery has taken longer to become evident in the headline GDP numbers with essentially zero growth recorded in 2012 and 2013 cumulatively. While the underlying performance of the domestic economy was positive, developments in the pharma-chem and ICT sectors served to weigh down on GDP. The data so far this year would suggest that this effect is over, with GDP growth of nearly 6 per cent recorded in the first half of this year. My Department is forecasting full-year GDP growth of 4.7 per cent this year. This is being driven by strong growth in exports but domestic demand indicators such as industrial production and retail sales are both in positive territory. This recovery has manifested itself in tax revenues which are expected to come in &euro;1 billion (or 2.5 per cent) above original expectations. </p><p>  Turning to fiscal policy, the macroeconomic and fiscal framework underpinning Budget 2015 was more favourable than anticipated. This was down to positive economic developments over the summer, an increase in tax revenues compared to profile as well as a reduction in national debt interest costs.  This allowed the introduction of a package of income tax reductions and expenditure increases amounting to &euro;1,050 million in Budget 2015, or about 0.6 per cent of GDP.  This package is likely to have a positive short-run impact on aggregate demand in the economy compared to an alternative of no policy change. It is estimated that the Budget package will add 0.3 per cent to real GDP in 2015 and an additional 0.2 percentage points to employment growth. </p><p>  Over the medium term my Department is forecasting average annual growth of just over 3 per cent in the 2015-2018 period. This is driven by a positive contribution from net exports on the back of economic growth in Ireland's trading partners.  Domestic demand is set to contribute to growth as well, with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in an increase in private consumption.</p></reply>

The Central Bank measures, as set out in the consultation document, would place restrictions on the loan to value (LTV) and loan to income (LTI) ratios banks can apply when lending for house purchase. They would apply to all mortgage lending in Ireland by regulated firms. The Central Bank has indicated that the primary objective of these measures is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to try to reduce the risk of bank credit and housing price spirals from developing in future. A copy of the Consultation Paper is available on the Central Bank website.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Central Bank is undertaking a wide public consultation process on its proposals and any person who has a view or comments on the proposals can submit them electronically to the Central Bank at by 8 December 2014 and these will be taken in to account by the Central Bank in its further consideration of the matter.<br/><br/>I am on the record as recognising the importance of sustainable and sensible mortgage lending and that there should be no return to the cycle of boom and bust mortgage lending. However, there is also a need to be mindful of the real needs of the economy and that any new macro prudential measures will not cause an undue distortion of economic and prudent lending activity. While I recognise that this is an area that falls within the independent competence of the Central Bank, there is a case to be made for introducing such measures in a more graduated manner for example in relation to the proportion of private home mortgages initially that can exceed the 80% LTV threshold.  Some adjustment to the proposals would allow home buyers and lenders time to adapt their economic behaviour and adjust to the new regulatory realities.<br/><br/>It is noted that a number of other countries who have introduced similar macro prudential measures have also adopted a graduated implementation approach. My Department's submission to the Central Bank is being finalised at present and will be submitted by the due deadline of Monday next.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will also be aware, Budget 2015 contained a number of measures to support a functioning housing market. In particular, in order to support first time buyers to save towards a deposit for their first home, DIRT will be refunded in respect of savings up to a maximum of 20% of the purchase price. This measure will run until the end of 2017.</p></reply>

Foreign-owned firms in are generally large, high-turnover enterprises concentrated in certain sectors and firm- specific and product-specific devleopments can have a bearing on measured GDP.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding these developments relating to contracted production, there is no doubt that economic recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.  High-frequency data such as retail sales, industrial production and purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) are all in strong positive territory. Employment growth resumed in 2012 and the Live Register continues to fall month-on-month. This recovery has manifested itself in tax revenues which are expected to come in &euro;1 billion (or 2.5 per cent) above original expectations. <br/><br/>Returning to the issue of contracted production, it should be recalled that it involves very little employment effect or second-round impact on the wider economy and complicates the task of forecasting net exports.  As developments are sector- and product-specific they have the potential to unwind or accelerate with potentially large impacts on measured GDP.</p></reply>

In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are also undertaking investigations in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This includes sharing of information and intelligence and intensive monitoring of the situation.</p><p>  In addition, as part of its routine compliance work Revenue actively monitor the mineral oil sector through analysis of monthly Return of Oil Movements and supply chain data. Any anomalies or breaches of Regulations detected are fully investigated as a matter of course.</p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy I am satisfied the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible actions to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud including, where possible,  pursuing prosecutions against offenders.</p></reply>

My officials believe the Deputy may be referring to VAT groups.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the EU VAT Directive establishes the EU Community VAT legislation upon which the national VAT legislation of all EU Member States, including Ireland, must comply.  Article 11 of the VAT Directive provides that a Member State may regard as a single taxable person (or VAT group) any persons established in the territory of that Member State who, while legally independent, are closely bound to each other by financial, economic and organisational links.  Article 11 is transposed into Irish legislation in Section 15 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  Section 15 provides that the Revenue Commissioners may regard two or more person established in the State that are closely bound by financial, economic and organisational links as a single taxable person (or VAT group) if this seems necessary or appropriate for the purpose of efficient and effective administration (including collection).</p><p>  Where the Revenue Commissioners treat a number of related persons as a single taxable person this generally removes the necessity of issuing VAT invoices in respect of transactions between these persons except in the case of certain property transactions. The persons that may be considered as related persons for the purposes of a single taxable person (or VAT group), is not confined to multinational corporations and includes a body corporate and an unincorporated body of persons as well as individuals.  Since the type of person who may be included in a VAT group is broad in scope I cannot accept that the VAT provisions referred to by the Deputy provide a greater advantage to multinational corporations. </p><p>  Furthermore, the Irish VAT code provides a generous cash flow advantage, specifically for small to medium enterprises, under the cash accounting system.  While VAT is normally accounted for on the basis of invoices issued, regardless of whether or not the trader has been paid for the supply, businesses with an annual turnover of &euro;2 million or less can opt to account for VAT on a cash receipts basis, where they do not have to pay VAT until payment for the supply is actually received.  This facility assists a significant number of small indigenous businesses in the critical area of cash flow.</p></reply>

The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes. The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not, therefore, involve the award of credits.<br/><br/>To be eligible for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, a person must: <br/><br/>- Permanently live in the State (exception may be made where EU regulations apply),<br/><br/>- Be aged under 66,<br/><br/>- Have started insurable employment or self-employment before the age of 56, <br/><br/>- Not work full-time, although for the purposes of this scheme, a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week, <br/><br/>- Care for a child (under 12) or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis. <br/><br/>It is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC. The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied. These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. <br/><br/>Where someone age 66 or over does not satisfy the conditions to qualify for a SPC, or qualifies for less than the maximum rate, they may instead qualify for one the following:<br/><br/>- The means-tested State pension (non-contributory). The maximum personal rate of this pension is &euro;219, which may be payable if their means are no more than &euro;30 per week. A reduced rate may be payable if their means are no more than &euro;245 per week. A living alone allowance may also be paid, where applicable. <br/><br/>- If a spouse receives the SPC, the other spouse may receive a payment, known as an increase for qualified adult (IQA), which may be up to &euro;206.30 per week. <br/><br/>- If widowed, they may qualify for a widow's contributory pension, which they may claim either based on their spouse&rsquo;s or their own social insurance record. The qualifying conditions for this require fewer contributions paid (260) than the SPC, and the maximum personal rate for those aged 66 or over is &euro;230.30. <br/><br/>Where a person qualifies for more than one of the above payments, they are paid under the pension that is most advantageous to them. <br/><br/>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced from 1994, and as with most schemes, this was without retrospective effect. Costs in relation to this scheme, under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. The possibility of backdating was considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions. This found that backdating it to 1953 would cost approximately &euro;160 million in additional spending annually. The amount reduces to &euro;150 million if backdated to 1973/74. <br/><br/>These additional costs would be very significant and consequently, the Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994. Any decision to change the scheme would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

With improvements in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  Given these changing demographics and the incrementally upward pressure of pension provision on State finances, there is a need to encourage a long-term savings habit by individuals to supplement income from the State pension for those who will otherwise not be in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement.<br/><br/>The key recommendation of the OECD Review of Irish Pension System, a report I commissioned and which was completed in 2013, was to improve the adequacy of pensions by increasing coverage in the funded part of the pensions system through a universal mandatory or quasi-mandatory employment based pension system.<i></i>In line with this recommendation and with the Programme for Government, the <i>2014-2016 Statement of Priorities</i>confirmed that during 2015 the Government will agree a roadmap and timeline for the introduction of a new, universal supplementary pension saving scheme.<br/><br/>The constituent factors involved in constructing an efficient and effective universal pension system are complex and diverse and it is of critical importance that any system chosen is correctly designed.  <br/><br/>Therefore, development of the roadmap will involve detailed consideration of the range of models and options available and will include co-operation across a range of Government Departments and engagement with all sectoral interests.</p></reply>

This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data. In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis.</p><p>  Revenue officers have visited and taken samples from every filling station about which a complaint has been made in the context of the current concerns about fuel contamination, and these samples have been analysed by the State Laboratory. From June 2014 to date 175 samples have been subject to scientific analysis.  Despite extensive testing by the State Laboratory, no evidence of any prohibited stretching agent has been found in any of the samples, except two samples taken from one site on the eastern seaboard.  The conclusive results received in that particular case has resulted in seizure of the product and closure of the facility and a file is being prepared for prosecution.</p><p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results have been received in recent days which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations (including Co. Mayo).  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to deliberately mix normal road diesel with petrol.  This contamination could have taken place earlier in the summer, well ahead of the problems manifesting themselves in cars in Co Mayo and elsewhere.</p><p>  If the problems that have come to light were caused by an unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed into petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.  However, the Deputy can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.  They will also continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and share information and intelligence on this issue.</p><p>  I am advised also that, as part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are challenged when encountered by enforcement officers, particularly throughout the Border Midlands West Region. No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for tackling fuel fraud, that they are aware of instances in the UK earlier this year where contaminated petrol was scientifically identified.  I am unaware of any further details relating to this matter.  I am however advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no instances of petrol being imported into Ireland from Bournemouth. </p></reply>

Alternative definitions in other EU legislation are not relevant to the interpretation of food for VAT purposes.</p></reply>

As a direct result of the extension of the exemption threshold from &euro;10,036 to &euro;12,012, an additional 80,000 low income earners will be removed from the charge entirely. This means that 28% of all income earners will not pay any Universal Social Charge at all.</p></reply>

However, neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. <br/><br/>The provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the need to make adequate provisioning to meet these risks. As a matter of course, insurance companies carry out reviews of the risks they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make decisions to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk. Insurance Ireland has indicated that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover.<br/><br/>I am advised that in cases where individuals are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at .<br/><br/>Government policy in relation to flooding is focussed on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.The Office of Public Works is carrying out an assessment of flood risk throughout the country under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.  This programme will include the  production of a comprehensive suite of flood risk maps and the development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk.  The plans will consider the best possible options, both structural and non-structural, for dealing with the risks on a long-term basis.<br/><br/>This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016. Works are completed on a prioritised basis. Because of the cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, this approach will see benefits over the medium and long term.<br/><br/>The Deputy has raised the issue of flood insurance in the Tralee, Co Kerry.  The OPW has advised that Tralee was identified through the national Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment as a location where flood risk was potentially significant. It is therefore designated as an Area for Further Assessment under the CFRAM Programme.  A detailed flood risk assessment of Tralee is being carried out by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW, under the Shannon CFRAM Study, in partnership with Kerry County Council.  Draft flood maps, which represent predicted flood extents for certain probabilities of flood events, are currently being produced and these will be subject to public consultation during the coming months.  Details of public consultation events will be advertised locally and will be available on the CFRAM Programme website .<br/><br/>The next phase in the CFRAM Study will be the flood risk mitigation options assessment process.  Flood Risk Management Plans will be prepared in late 2015. The Office of Public Works and Insurance Ireland have agreed on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes. The outcome of this arrangement is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works and will, therefore, be able to reflect this in assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed. The OPW is continuing work on developing data on completed flood relief schemes in the format required by Insurance Ireland.  The insurance industry is however committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is to be expected that this could facilitate the provision of flood cover in areas that are protected by completed schemes. <br/><br/>Following the severe weather events at the end 2013/early 2014, and on foot of Government decision to provide up to &euro;19.6m for storm damages to public coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure, the OPW has allocated funding of &euro;18.3m to local authorities for programmes of works to repair damaged public coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.  The overall response to the severe weather events was co-ordinated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the funding for repair of coastal defences is part of a total of up to &euro;70 million which the Government has allocated for repair and remediation works arising from the storms.</p></reply>

It is important that consumers are given adequate notice to allow them to take the required steps to close or transfer their accounts. </p><p>  I wish to highlight that all banks providing current accounts in Ireland are subject to the Central Bank's Current Account Switching Code, which is designed to make the process of switching current accounts easier and quicker and to offer protection and support for consumers when switching bank account. The Switching Code places obligations and time limits on both the old and the new bank when completing the switching process. Where accounts include credit facilities, such credit facilities will be subject to the credit assessment process applicable at the receiving bank.  </p><p>  I have said before that I expect that the restructuring of the banking sector in Ireland and the recovery of the economy will present opportunities for the entry of new market participants well positioned to be confident in the future profitability of an Irish branch or subsidiary. </p><p>  It is important to highlight that the Irish financial market offers opportunities to institutions. This Government has taken steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution considering establishing in Ireland. In seeking to reduce the barriers to entry which are specific to the Irish banking market, Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, as amended, which provides for the regulation of bank fees and charges has been disapplied for the first three years in the case of new financial service providers setting up in Ireland.  This arrangement was provided for in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the entry into the market of a new retail credit firm authorised by the Central Bank over the summer. </p><p>  The  Deputy will also be aware of the creation of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), ensuring that in future, Irish businesses have access to long-term funding.</p></reply>

The savings rate is usually positive, as households accumulate resources for future consumption.  The savings rate can vary with the economic cycle but also because of larger structural changes in the economy such as population ageing.</p><p>  Data from the first quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2014 are available from the CSO. Although the savings rate tends to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, there has been a jump in the savings rate since the sharp fall in economic activity between 2007 and 2011. Prior to Q4 2007, the household savings rate averaged 8.0 per cent. Between Q1 2008 and Q1 2014 it has averaged 12.4 per cent.</p><p>  The increase in the savings rate has been driven by several factors:</p><p>- The decline in household income in the years following 2008 prompted the behavioural response by households of elevating their level of precautionary savings in response to increased uncertainty surrounding future income levels.</p><p>- The second main reason for the increase in the savings rate was the very large decline in household assets. As calculated by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI), household assets have fallen by a little over a fifth since the end of 2007, largely due to the large decline in house prices. As a result, households have responded by reducing their liabilities. Households became net borrowers in early 2009 and have reduces liabilities by about one eighth since the end of 2007.</p><p>- Finally, Ireland's population has begun to age, a process which will continue in the decades ahead and which will drive savings behaviour to smooth consumption over the lifecycle.</p></reply>

The flexible options at retirement introduced and expanded over time in relation to Defined Contribution (DC) pension savings, and which I have outlined in the previous response to the Deputy (including the option and conditions relating to investment in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund or AMRF), are designed to facilitate this purpose. </p><p>  The option to take the balance of any DC pension savings (after the tax-free lump sum)  as a single taxable lump sum amount or, alternatively, by way of investment in an Approved Retirement Fund  or ARF is conditional on the individual having attained the age of  75 years or, if younger, having pension income in payment for life of &euro;12,700 per annum at the time of exercising the option (which pension income could include a pension paid by the State). If these conditions are not satisfied, an individual must either invest in an AMRF or purchase a pension annuity with the remaining pension funds. These various requirements are in keeping with the aim of ensuring that individuals have a source of pension income over the entire period of their retirement.</p><p>  In this year's  Finance Bill, I have introduced an option to allow AMRF owners to draw-down up to 4% of the assets of such funds each year. This is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to boost their existing income and provide a more certain form of  income prior to reaching age 75. This change has been welcomed as improving the accessibility to pension savings, particularly of those with lower pension fund values at the point of retirement. I have no plans for further changes in this area at this time. </p><p>  There is no requirement on Qualifying Fund Managers who hold and manage AMRFs on behalf of individuals to make returns to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the number of AMRFs under their management. I am not in a position to say, therefore, how many AMRFs are in place. I understand anecdotally, however, that investment in an AMRF is viewed by many at this time as a preferable option to the immediate purchase of a pension annuity. The funds in an AMRF can be used at any time to purchase a pension annuity and the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF with unfettered access to the funds, subject to taxation, when the beneficial owner reaches age 75 or satisfies the pension income requirement, if sooner.</p></reply>

They would apply to all mortgage lending in Ireland by regulated firms. The Central Bank has indicated that the primary objective of these measures is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to try to reduce the risk of bank credit and housing price spirals from developing in future. <br/><br/>The specific measures proposed for primary dwelling houses are to restrict new lending to a limit of 80% of the value of the property and to a maximum of 3.5 times gross annual income.  It is important to note that the Central Bank has also stated that banks will be able to lend, in some instances, above these threshold limits. However, any lending in excess of the loan to value ratio must be limited to no more than 15% of the value of new loans issued and, in respect of exceeding the loan to income ratio, to no more that 20% of the value of new loans.  Other exemptions will also be available in certain circumstances. <br/><br/>The Central Bank has also outlined measures for buy to let (BTL) mortgages which propose to restrict BTL lending above 70% LTV to no more than 10% of the value of all housing loans for investment purposes.  The Central Bank has now commenced a consultation process on the proposed measures and submissions and comments on these can be made to <i><font color="#0000FF">r</font></i>8th December 2014.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that Budget 2015 contained a number of measures to support a functioning housing market. In particular, in order to support first time buyers to save towards a deposit for their first home, DIRT will be refunded in respect of savings up to a maximum of 20% of the purchase price. This measure will run until the end of 2017.</p></reply>

An intensification by the Central Bank of its engagement with mortgage lenders to require them, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, to propose and conclude sustainable and durable alternative arrangements to their customers in mortgage arrears of greater than 90 days;</p><p>2. Significant reforms to personal insolvency and the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, to make it more accessible for people with unsustainable personal and mortgage debt to address their position;</p><p>3. Updating the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to provide safeguards to cooperating borrowers while also promoting and encouraging efforts by both lenders and borrowers to meaningfully address mortgage arrears or pre-arrears;</p><p>4. Mortgage to rent which is now available as a social housing response to allow people to remain in their house, where possible; and</p><p>5. The provision of an independent mortgage information and advice service.</p><p>  The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in arrears. Under the CCMA, if a borrower is not satisfied with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. Borrowers also have the right to appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.   If the borrower is still unhappy with the outcome of the appeal or the complaint made to the lender, they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman. </p><p>  The monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department also provides an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.  The Department's latest publication, with data for the end of September 2014, shows that the number of principal dwelling home or PDH mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has fallen by over 2,000 accounts in the month to 67,854 accounts. In addition, the publication showed that total PDH mortgage accounts in arrears were now below 100,000 for the first time since the financial crisis.</p><p>  Taken together, the framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.  However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.</p></reply>

The European Commission in its autumn forecasts estimate that real unit labour costs in Ireland will fall by 4.3 per cent annually in 2014 which is the largest decline across all EU Member States and compares with a fall of 1.2 per cent in the UK, and increases of 0.1 per cent in the EU, 0.2 per cent in the US and 0.3 per cent in the euro over the same time period. Competitiveness has been achieved through wage moderation vis-a-vis trading partners as well as productivity improvements.</p><p>  The real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI) is a measure of the trade-weighted exchange rate for Ireland, adjusted for relative price developments. In October 2014, Ireland's real HCI fell by 3.9 per cent year on year.  A fall indicates an improvement in price competitiveness and leaves Irish-based firms better equipped to compete on the international market. </p><p>  Relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to our euro area peers. For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2009. Despite continued low levels of HICP inflation in Ireland, the rate has now been at or above the euro are rate for several months. Developments in this regard will require ongoing monitoring to ensure that hard-won competitiveness gains are not lost in the years to come.</p></reply>

The main driver of headline inflation is the fall in the price of goods, notably commodity and non-energy industrial goods prices, while service price inflation remains relatively moderate. Core HICP inflation, which excludes energy prices and unprocessed food, was up 0.8 per cent over the year to October 2014. The modest price pressures in the economy continue to be driven by a small number of sectors (e.g. Alcohol Beverages and Tobacco; Miscellaneous Goods and Services; Restaurants and Hotels and Education). </p><p>  House prices are monitored as part of the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) as part of the European Semester. As the recently-published Alert Mechanism Report refers to house price developments in 2013, the small increase in Irish house prices in that year was well below the threshold for this indicator and therefore did not trigger an alert.  It should be noted, however, that Irish residential property prices increased by 16.3 per cent in the year to October 2014. </p><p>  The most recent forecasts by my Department, for Budget 2015, estimate an average annual rate of HICP inflation of 0.5 per cent for this year. In this context, the annual HICP inflation in the year to date has averaged 0.4 per cent. As such, we continue to operate in a low inflation environment. It is also important to note that deflationary trends were highlighted as an economic risk in Budget 2015 and continue to be monitored in this regard.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. <br/><br/>Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, particularly lending to the domestic market, and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector. Both banks have recently reported on increased year on year sanctioning activity for lending to the SME sector. <br/><br/>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses, and the SME State Bodies Group provides forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SME's access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  <br/><br/>Some of the main policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:<br/><br/>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .  <br/><br/>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth and also ensuring that credit provided to SMEs meets their needs rather than the needs of those who offer the credit.  The SBCI, from available funding of some &euro;800 million initially, will provide a more extensive range of financing than is currently offered in Ireland such as loans of longer duration, with in-built payment holidays that encourage and enable growth of our SMEs. The SBCI will have a lower cost of funding and this bene t must be passed onto SMEs.  The SBCI is working with its first lending partners to provide initial funding to the SME sector by the end of 2014.  A full roll-out will occur from January 2015 with traditional bank lenders and importantly, new credit providers from beyond the traditional bank sector being involved which means SMEs will benefit from greater choice as well as more funding.  More information on the SBCI can be found on .<br/><br/>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included.<br/><br/>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund. This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness. <br/><br/>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at .<br/><br/>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the forthcoming Action Plan for Jobs 2015 will include a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing of growth in the SME sector. </p></reply>

Taken in conjunction with first quarter data, GDP grew by 5.8 per cent in the first half of this year. The increase in economic activity is broadly-based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.</p><p>  Exports rose by 13 per cent in the year to the second quarter of this year.  This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001 and there is growing evidence that the impact of the patent expiry issue in the pharmaceutical sector has passed. </p><p>  On the domestic front, personal consumption was up by 1.8 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter and investment increased by 18.5 per cent.   Consumer spending has been strong in the first eight months of the year.  Retail sales in the period January to October were up 6 per cent when compared with the same period in 2013.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up almost 4 per cent over the same period.  Investment in building and construction as well as in machinery and equipment spending are on a rising path. </p><p>  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with employment increasing in each of the last seven quarters. The total number of jobs has increased by over 80,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012.  In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012 to 10.9 per cent in October.  </p><p>  My Department is forecasting full-year GDP growth of 4.7 per cent this year. This is being driven by strong growth in exports, but domestic demand indicators such as industrial production and retail sales are also in positive territory. This recovery has manifested itself in tax revenues which are expected to come in &euro;1 billion (or 2.5 per cent) above original expectations. </p><p>  Over the medium term, my Department is forecasting average annual GDP growth of just over 3 per cent in the 2015-2018 period. This is driven by a positive contribution from net exports on the back of economic growth in Ireland's trading partners.  Domestic demand is set to contribute to growth as well, with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in an increase in private consumption. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the current improvement, risks to the outlook remain for Ireland.  These relate to the low inflation observed in many advanced economics as well as geo-political tensions and the underperformance of the euro area economy. As highlighted in the material accompanying Budget 2015,  the phenomenon of contracted production has boosted GDP in the first half of this year. It complicates the task of forecasting net exports at this juncture and, by extension, GDP.</p><p>  In terms of the public finances, policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in the deficit in recent years.  This decline has been in a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting domestic activity as well as repairing the public finances.  All of Ireland's interim deficit ceilings under the Excessive Deficit Procedure have been met and Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent in 2015.  This has been important in restoring Ireland's credibility in the international markets - bond yields have fallen substantially since the high rates of mid-2011.  The debt ratio has peaked and is now on a downward path.  After 2015, fiscal policy will be set in line with the requirement to move towards Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective, which is for a balanced budget in structural terms.</p><p>  The macroeconomic and fiscal framework underpinning Budget 2015 was more favourable than anticipated. This was as a result of positive economic developments over the summer, an increase in tax revenues compared to profile as well as a reduction in national debt interest costs.  This allowed the introduction of a package of income tax reductions and expenditure increases amounting to &euro;1,050 million in Budget 2015, or about 0.5 per cent of GDP.  This package is likely to have a positive short-run impact on aggregate demand in the economy compared to an alternative of no policy change. It is estimated that the Budget package will add 0.3 per cent to real GDP in 2015 and an additional 0.2 percentage points to employment growth.</p></reply>

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.  </p><p>  At present, certain childcare and pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates under the terms of paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001, where the organisation is a charitable organisation, that uses its property exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit. The organisation claiming charitable status for the purpose of qualifying for exemption from rates must comply with the definition of &quot;charitable organisation&quot; as stated in PART 1 section 3 of the Valuation Act, 2001. Similarly, certain pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates where  the conditions detailed in paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 are met.  </p><p>  Inconsistency in the approach to the exemption from rates of childcare and early education facilities was raised at Committee Stage of the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012 in the Seanad with Minister of State Simon Harris, who was taking the Bill through the Seanad on my behalf. The  Government's response was to  approve  a Seanad Report Stage amendment to the Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis. This amendment was proposed and passed at Report Stage in the Seanad on 20th November 2014. I intend that the Bill will be considered by the D&aacute;il shortly. </p><p>  Making exception to core, long-standing valuation principles can have a far reaching negative impact on the rates system and consequently a far reaching impact on Local Government funding. The decision taken by Government to extend the exemption from rates for early childcare and education was taken having considered the views of stakeholders in the sector. As outlined in the Seanad, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that is a significant source of funding for Local Authorities. One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable.   Therefore, I do not intend to extend this exemption to all early childhood education facilities providing early childhood care and education.  </p></reply>

IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Midlands Region comprises of Westmeath, Longford, Roscommon, Laois and Offaly and is a strong cluster in the medical technology and life sciences sectors.  The Midlands is home to key IDA Ireland client companies such as Abbott, Covidien, Integra, GeneMedix, Freund, Utah, KCI, and AMS.   In addition, it is home to international business services companies such as Teleflex, AXA, NPD Group and PPD.  The fact that these international companies are already located in the region makes the Midlands attractive to potential clients as a location. Another factor to attract clients into the region is the construction of a 25,000 sq.ft.  advance technology building in Athlone by IDA Ireland, as set out in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>  In Longford, there are 6 IDA companies employing 700 people. In the region as a whole, there are 43 IDA Ireland-supported companies employing over 4,800 people in full or part-time employment.</p><p>  I am glad to say that during 2013, as part of the Succeed in Ireland initiative, Ark Consulting announced the creation of 10 jobs, to be located in Longford.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises. My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices. The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation. The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops. The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.</p><p>  Additionally, IDA Ireland is working on a new corporate strategy for the years 2015 to 2020, which will be launched early in the New Year. I am working closely with IDA on this.</p></reply>

The Deputy is asked to note that this table reflects only part of the Local Enterprise Office activity to the end of October 2014. In many cases payments are on hold pending completion by the LEO clients of the necessary financial returns, etc, and the November and early December period would traditionally see a large volume of grants being completed.Since the start of the year, over 700 projects totalling &euro;10.86m have been approved by the 31 LEOs, which will result in jobs gains in excess of 1,000.  In addition, 4,500 clients have received mentoring services to improve capability and drive growth. <br/><br/>The LEOs have been active in the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur Programme which aims to support a new wave of young entrepreneurs. Results to date are impressive with over 1,018 completed applications received, most of whom would have undergone a training bootcamp where they would have received intensive business development training and mentoring aimed at improving their business skills. <br/><br/>In other areas, the Service Level Agreement entered into between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities provided for a Centre of Excellence (CoE) to be established in Enterprise Ireland to drive the introduction of best practice across the LEO network. The CoE, in partnership with the LEO network, have made significant progress to date; for example, a Training and Staff Development Strategy has been agreed across a wide ranging programme including team development, financial appraisal, customer engagement and new social media applications, while further development areas have been identified for 2015. On average 8 training days per LEO staff member have been delivered. This strategy will contribute to the effectiveness of the Local Enterprise Offices.<br/><br/>The LEOs are also party to new operational protocols with key stakeholders including Micro Finance Ireland, Revenue, Department of Social Protection, the Credit Review Office, Skillsnet and F&aacute;ilte Ireland which establish structured links, increase the sharing of information, increase and maintain mutual awareness of the services and supports offered to clients through these agencies and the LEOs.  <br/><br/>Each LEO has also developed a Local Enterprise Development Plan with associated metrics which sets out the key objectives and associated tasks and activities aimed at delivering upon those objectives. These Plans effectively establish the work agenda for the LEOs within their County each year and will ensure that the LEOs are focused on delivering enterprise support services for their clients. The CoE has commenced working with the LEOs with a view to preparing Plans for 2015.<br/><br/>I am satisfied that the staff in the LEOs are making huge efforts to ensure that this major reform of the enterprise support structure is implemented in a manner that is beneficial to sustainable development of the enterprise sector in their County.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: Grant aid paid by LEO to client companies and no. of LEO Training Programmes + Participants at end of October 2014</b><table><tr><th>LEO</th><th>Paid Amount &euro;</th><th>No of Clients Paid</th><th>No of Projects Paid</th><th>No Of Training Programmes</th><th>Total Participants</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>255,010 </td><td>33</td><td>35</td><td>62</td><td>1,248</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>212,973 </td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>28</td><td>374</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>154,853 </td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>17</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>175,603 </td><td>23</td><td>24</td><td>68</td><td>744</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North/West</td><td>185,728 </td><td>23</td><td>23</td><td>115</td><td>1496</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South</td><td>288,790 </td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>51</td><td>689</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>292,324 </td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>25</td><td>697</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td>313,767 </td><td>41</td><td>42</td><td>48</td><td>813</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown</td><td>360,095 </td><td>33</td><td>37</td><td>26</td><td>555</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Fingal</td><td>87,134 </td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>58</td><td>1,237</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South</td><td>180,623 </td><td>21</td><td>21</td><td>40</td><td>482</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>25,330 </td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>145,662 </td><td>21</td><td>22</td><td>36</td><td>668</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>204,956 </td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>19</td><td>240</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>237,756 </td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>60</td><td>580</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>74,121 </td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>30</td><td>235</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>197,274 </td><td>15</td><td>17</td><td>21</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>301,629 </td><td>36</td><td>38</td><td>5</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>148,726 </td><td>26</td><td>27</td><td>24</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>118,005 </td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>33</td><td>421</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>246,300 </td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>33</td><td>869</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>80,500 </td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>23</td><td>295</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>95,983 </td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>18</td><td>252</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>244,239 </td><td>22</td><td>24</td><td>22</td><td>254</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>233,470 </td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>79</td><td>284</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>315,548 </td><td>23</td><td>26</td><td>31</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>126,541 </td><td>25</td><td>25</td><td>65</td><td>549</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>439,527 </td><td>51</td><td>57</td><td>95</td><td>428</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>183,297 </td><td>21</td><td>21</td><td>54</td><td>730</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>233,725 </td><td>31</td><td>32</td><td>55</td><td>675</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>310,615 </td><td>22</td><td>26</td><td>44</td><td>1,116</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>6,470,105 </td><td>683 </td><td>719 </td><td>1,294</td><td>17,145</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The LEOs became the First-Stop-Shop providing guidance and support to new entrepreneurs and existing micro and small business owners.As part of the reform, the LEOs are being supported by Enterprise Ireland's Micro Enterprise and Small Business Division which has established a Centre of Excellence responsible for developing an improved environment for small and micro business and utilising Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s experience and specialised sectoral approaches to business innovation and development. <br/><br/>The restructuring of enterprise supports is underpinned by a number of important factors, among which was the development of a comprehensive and robust Service Level Agreement (SLA) between Enterprise Ireland (EI) and each Local Authority. The SLA provides a framework for the delivery of the LEO services and LEO activities and addresses such issues as:<br/><br/>- Protocols relating to Budgets, Project Evaluation and Approval;<br/><br/>- Micro Enterprise Policy guidelines as articulated by my Department;<br/><br/>- Robust Performance Indicators measuring employment, start-ups and other metrics;<br/><br/>- Roles and Responsibilities of respective bodies (EI, LAs, LEOs)<br/><br/>- Benchmarking of LEOs<br/><br/>- Corporate Governance. <br/><br/>The SLA also includes a template for a Local Enterprise Development Plan which each LEO must prepare on an annual basis, including both LEO and Local Authority supports to enterprise. The SLA helps to ensure the consistent application of policy across all LEOs from the evaluation of applications to the spending of budgets allocated. It is complemented by a range of other measures, such as staff training, new communications structures, and the preparation of the Local Enterprise Development Plans, which will help to make the LEOs the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; place within a County for anyone with a business idea.<br/><br/>There is provision in the SLA for an annual review of the framework SLA, the outcome of which will influence the adjustment of the current, and development and agreement of future SLAs. A formal review group will be established at national level chaired by my Department and involving EI, the City and County Manager&rsquo;s Association, my Department and a nominated Head of LEO. This review will be carried out in early 2015.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I am satisfied that the Local Authorities and the staff in the LEOs are making huge efforts to ensure that this major reform is implemented in a manner that is beneficial to sustainable development of the enterprise sector in their County.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-03a.184.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120300070#WRC02500"><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the related issues of milk quota abolition, the &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; and the butterfat coefficient correction have been the subject of much discussion at EU level over the recent past.  Milk quotas will be abolished from the end of March 2015 and I have been very active in seeking to secure further measures to ensure a soft landing for milk producers in the period in advance of this.    In terms of the current quota position, at the end of October it was estimated that Ireland was 7.15% over-quota, with month-on-month increases continuing to be evident. At current rates, this would result in a superlevy bill of approximately &euro;115m. The superlevy is set by milk quota Regulations agreed at EU level. Any amendment to the regime requires a proposal from the Commission and agreement of a qualified majority of all other Member States.</p><p>  At numerous Agriculture Council meetings over the recent past the issue of additional measures to ensure a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; to milk quota abolition in 2015 was discussed, where I, and some other like-minded Ministers consistently called on the Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime, via the butterfat correction in particular, but such an agreement was not forthcoming at the time and this remains the case. As there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers such an adjustment looks unlikely to be achieved.   </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, for super levy purposes, butterfat causes an adjustment to milk supply &ndash; the greater the differential between average butterfat (current levels) and reference fat levels (base fat), the greater the adjustment to milk intake levels. The proposed solution is to reduce the positive butterfat co-efficient and increase the negative one to ensure fair distribution across Member States. Technically, this can be changed under Commission competency at Management Committee level. The Commissioner has said they will not move on butterfat without majority support at Council, and unfortunately, as outlined previously, there number of countries opposed to any move on butterfat is such that an impasse has been reached and an agreement has not been forthcoming.   </p><p>  It must be clearly noted that a number of other countries are opposed to any action on the issue of further soft landing measures and have actively sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone. I am obviously resolutely opposed to any suggestion of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years. The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible. The current Italian presidency agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July, it was again discussed in October and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils, including December, where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.   </p><p>  In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard to the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call. I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.</p></reply>

However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, under section 4(2), designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p><p>  My predecessor, Minister James Reilly T.D, wrote to the The Health and Social Care Professionals Council in May of this year advising it of his intention, in the public interest, to designate by regulation the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under the Act. The Act provides that the Minister for Health is obliged to consult with the Council in the first instance concerning a proposed designation. The also gives interested persons, organisations and bodies an opportunity to make representations to the Minister.  The Council has been asked to advise on a number of issues concerning the proposed designation and has been requested to take into consideration the recently published report of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on the academic standards necessary for the accreditation of courses in Counselling and Psychotherapy.  This is an essential element as it would inform, for the purpose of registration, the assessment by the registration board, when established, of the qualifications of those currently in practice.  </p><p>  This is the first stage in the consultation process under the Act and I expect to receive the Council's report in the coming weeks. I will then proceed to the next stage which will involve a much wider consultation when I have fully considered the Council's report. The question of making the Council's report publicly available can be considered at that stage. While a number of issues remain to be clarified including decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of applicants for registration, I intend to progress the question of regulating of counsellors and psychotherapists as a priority. </p></reply>

On the basis of the new material uncovered and on the legal advice received, the Government has decided to request the European Court of Human Rights to revise its judgment in the case.   It will be contended that the ill-treatment suffered by the fourteen men should be recognised as torture.</p><p>  This decision was not taken lightly. As EU partners and as strong bilateral partners, the UK and Ireland have worked together to promote human rights in many fora and during the original case the UK did not contest that a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human rights took place.     The British and Irish Governments have both worked hard to build stronger, more trusting relations in recent years and I believe that this relationship will now stand to us as we work through the serious matters raised by this material which has come to light in recent months. </p></reply>

This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. <br/><br/>Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.<br/><br/>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. This Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on my Departments website at the following link , or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, phone 0761 108588.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that it is my firm view that all schools should be inclusive. It is with this spirit of inclusiveness that the proposed Admissions to Schools Bill is designed. The regulatory framework should see improved access to schools for all pupils and ensure there is consistency, fairness and transparency in the admissions policies of schools and in the service they provide to parents.  If the parent feels that they may have experienced discrimination, they may wish to contact the Equality Tribunal which is an independent State body set up to investigate or mediate complaints of discrimination.  They can be contacted at The Equality Tribunal, Davitt House, 65A Adelaide Road, Dublin 2, Tel: +353 1 6136800 or  Email: info@equalitytribunal.ie.</p></reply>

It will be considered by the ERC, and the results of this consideration by my Department and the National Council for Special Education, but will not be shared with other Departments or statutory bodies.<br/><br/>My Department has collected this data in order to consider potential revisions to the system of allocating Resource Teaching and Learning Support to schools on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot; (2014).<br/><br/>The Working Group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have. The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders.<br/><br/>The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioural disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders. <br/><br/>Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.<br/><br/>Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives. <br/><br/>The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br/><br/>Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school. <br/><br/>At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey. <br/><br/>The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data. Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<br/><br/>Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire. I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br/><br/>Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. <br/><br/>The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.<br/><br/>SNAs are allocated to schools to enable them to support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs. The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually, taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children. <br/><br/>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. <br/><br/>It is a matter for schools to make applications to the NCSE for SNA support for pupils who are enrolled to their schools. Schools who wish to make new applications for SNA support for pupils may continue to make such applications to the NCSE. <br/><br/>All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The objective of the application process was to enable customers to confirm their details for billing and relevant PPS numbers were requestedin order for customers to claim the allowances that they were eligible for. <br/><br/>On 19 November 2014, the Government decided on the introduction of a number of measures in relation to a revised approach to water charges. This was done to provide clarity and certainty and ensure that water charges are affordable for customers. As the new arrangements are based on self-declaration and appropriate audit, PPS numbers will no longer be required by Irish Water.In compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Acts, Irish Water will delete PPS data already collected during the customer registration process to protect customers&rsquo; data. Irish Water has developed a protocol in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to address this data deletion exercise.My Department does not have any information on the number of application packs that have been returned with the PPS number included prior to 19 November.<br/><br/>To implement the changed charging regime, and to provide those households who have yet to register with an opportunity to respond to the Irish Water customer registration campaign, so that they may avail of the new benefits and to receive accurate bills, it will be important to register by 2 February 2015. Customers who have already responded to the registration process are not required to do anything further in relation to this.Anyone who has already responded to Irish Water can contact the organisation by phone at 1890 448 448 to advise of changes or updates to their previous response.<br/><br/>The Water Services Bill 2014, which was published yesterday, provides that where a customer of Irish Water does not register with Irish Water, they shall be liable for a charge of &euro;260 for each year until such time that they have registered.  The Bill also provides for the payment of an annual water conservation grant ; however,w here the occupier of a dwelling has not provided details of their water supply and waste water services to Irish Water , he or she will not be eligible for the grant. The Bill also provides for the removal of the power of Irish Water to use PPS numbers &ndash; this section will be commenced when the data deletion exercise is completed.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives and has contacted all Oireachtas members to provide details of an improved level of service which it is aiming to provide. <br/><br/>The team can be contacted via email to <i>oireachtasmembers@water.ie</i>or by telephone on a new dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

My Department is currently working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Commission to finalise the text of the document with a view to commencing the implementation of the LEADER element of the Programme in 2015.  The LEADER element of the RDP is delivered by Local Action Groups (LAGS) through the medium of Local Development Strategies (LDSs). The selection process to select LEADER LDSs and LAGS for the 2014-2020 programme will be an open process that will facilitate participation by any entity that meets the selection criteria. I expect the process to begin shortly and in this context I cannot say what entities will be successful until the process is complete. As required by the EU regulation governing the programme, successful local development strategies will be selected by an independent selection committee established for that purpose.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in network upgrades and at least 1.6m of the 2.3m addresses in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services by the end of 2016. In October, two companies announced projects to deliver direct fibre connectivity to approximately 500,000 homes and businesses in every county in Ireland. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available. Under EU State Aid guidelines Member States cannot intervene in areas where commercial investors have plans to roll out services.<br/><br/>On the 24th November, I launched a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map. This allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether or not their premises/home is included in the Government&rsquo;s proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on a county by county basis as to which villages and townlands are to be included.<br/><br/>This map can be accessed at e.  There is a wealth of data and information available here to better inform citizens about the on-going commercial investment in improved broadband services as well as the detail of the Government&rsquo;s ambitious plan to ensure all parts of Ireland have access to high quality broadband services.<br/><br/>The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015.<br/><br/>A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) towards the end of 2015.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Panel engaged extensively with all the parties involved during its investigations and although it was not within the remit of the panel to address the issues concerning the deferred members of the scheme, the Panel met with representatives of the deferred members committee on two occasions.  The Panel explained to the deferred representatives that the process it was involved in was an industrial relations process and that responsibility for dealing with the deferred members rested with the IASS Trustee through engagement with employers.</p><p>  In its Report , published on 16 June 2014, the Panel recommended, inter alia, that the IASS Trustee engage with the employers on ways to alleviate as much of the impact of the Trustee proposals as possible whilst also recognising the overall affordability to the employers of the proposals for active and deferred members.  It was the Panel&rsquo;s view that these discussions should be informed by a set of principles which the Panel had discussed and agreed with the employers and communicated to the Trustee.  </p><p>  As a result of that Report, there was an uplift in the monies to be provided by the employers outside of the IASS, a significant proportion of which is intended for the deferred members to make a contribution towards mitigating the benefit cuts proposed by the IASS Trustee. This is an essential consequence of the process proposed by the Expert Panel.</p><p>  Specifically, almost &euro;20m in extra funding is being proposed by the employers in addition to the &euro;40m already being made available for deferred members. The total contribution proposed by the employers aimed at resolving the IASS difficulties amounts to over &euro;260m.</p><p>  It is the Panel's definitive view that the proposed measures represent the best possible outcome that can be achieved and that if this final opportunity to resolve this very protracted problem is not grasped now, the situation facing members of the IASS will deteriorate further.</p></reply>

Farmers were paid for the quantified costs of compliance, except where flat rate payments per hectare were agreed in advance.<br/><br/>The following plan types were paid at a flat rate per hectare, assuming eligibility and adherence to the appropriate prescriptions: <br/><br/>- Chough<br/><br/>- Corncrake (in the Shannon Callows) <br/><br/>- Hen Harrier<br/><br/>- Commonage Destocking (mainly in restricted areas of Mayo and Galway)<br/><br/>- Corncrake (in Mayo and Donegal)<br/><br/>- Breeding Wader (in the Shannon Callows)<br/><br/>With the exception of the commonage destocking plans, these plans were entered into on a voluntary basis.  The relevant prescriptions were prepared and tailored to ensure that farming supported an improvement in the condition of the habitat or for the species being managed, under contract with the farmer.  The NPWS Farm Plan Scheme was therefore designed to incentivise farmers to go above and beyond their statutory requirements and was not compensation for designation.<br/><br/>The payment rates that pertained under the various plan types are set out in the table.  It may be noted that capital works may also be a part of individual plans and are paid according to costs incurred.<table><tr><th>Plan Type</th><th>Payment Rates</th></tr><tr><td>Chough</td><td>Payment at two rates: <br /><br />&euro;250 per hectare up to 40 hectares<br /><br />&euro;25 per hectare for areas in excess of 40 hectares  </td></tr><tr><td>Corncrake (Shannon Callows)</td><td>Payment at three rates: <br /><br />&euro;450 per hectare, up to a maximum of 40 hectares, for meadow<br /><br />&euro;325 per hectare, up to a maximum of 40 hectares, for wet grassland, marsh or fen<br /><br />&euro;25 per hectare for areas in excess of 40 hectares</td></tr><tr><td>Hen Harrier</td><td>Payment at three rates: <br /><br />&euro;350 per hectare up to 40 hectares<br /><br />&euro;25 per hectare from 40 to 120 hectares<br /><br />&euro;5 per hectare on lands greater than 120 hectares</td></tr><tr><td>Commonage Destocking Plans</td><td>&euro;39.50 per destocked sheep per annum (reviewed annually)<br /><br />&euro;50 per sheep per annum offwintered from commonage areas for a period of 5 months in Galway and &euro;40 per annum in Mayo</td></tr><tr><td>Corncrake (Mayo and Donegal)</td><td>Measure 1: Creation of Early/Late Cover (ELC)<br /><br />&euro;1.75 per m2 for the first 0.1 hectare<br /><br />&euro;1.50 per m2 for areas greater than 0.1 hectare (to a maximum of 0.5 hectares)<br /><br />Measure 2: Maintenance of ELC<br /><br />Up to 0.1 hectares @ &euro;880 per hectare<br /><br />0.11 &ndash; 0.25 hectares @ &euro;440 per hectare<br /><br />Greater than 0.26 hectares @ &euro;275 per hectare<br /><br /><br /><br />Measure 3: Delayed Mowing<br /><br />July 15th meadow mowing: &euro;275 per hectare <br /><br />August 20th meadow mowing: &euro;450 per hectare<br /><br />September 1st meadow mowing: &euro;510 per hectare<br /><br />Measure 4: Delayed Grazing<br /><br />Post-July 15th pasture grazing: &euro;275 per hectare<br /><br />Post-August 20th pasture grazing: &euro;450 per hectare</td></tr><tr><td>Breeding Wader</td><td>Maximum rate for top quality habitat of &euro;366 per hectare</td></tr></table>All plan payments other than those described above were calculated at farm level, on the basis of cost incurred or income foregone.  This generally arose where a generic prescription was not applied.  An example of this would be payments to farmers who tolerated losses by wintering wildfowl (geese and swans) in the Wexford Slobs.  The costs to the farmer were established on a field by field basis and it was not possible to apply a generic prescription.<br/><br/>In general, payments to farmers were calculated on the area of eligible lands under appropriate management <i>or</i><i><i></i></i>the income foregone for compliance with an NPWS Farm Plan. Therefore, the range of payments to farmers per annum was from zero payment in a few cases, to substantial payments in a limited number of cases, where significant losses resulted from compliance at individual farm level.</p></reply>

My role, as Minister for Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with regard to the protection and management of our built and natural heritage, is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, together with the role of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners as regards heritage assets.  </p><p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage and gives local planning authorities primary responsibility to identify and protect architectural heritage by including structures on the Record of Protected Structures.
