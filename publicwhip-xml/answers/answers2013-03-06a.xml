If the motorist does not pay the fixed charge, he or she will in the normal course be prosecuted for the alleged offence.</p><p>  There can be circumstances where the fixed charge notice may be cancelled in accordance with Garda procedures drawn up in the light of legislative exemptions and prosecutorial guidelines.  Cancellation occurs where it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair or proportionate.  Decisions on cancellations are governed by Garda policies and procedures, framed around legislative and prosecutorial guidelines issued by the DPP.  Cancellation can occur in circumstances where, for example, exemptions apply in relation to emergency vehicles or the wearing of seatbelts, or where there are evidential difficulties, such as where the registration number registered by a speed camera does not correspond to the vehicle in question, or where there are emergency medical circumstances such as, for example, a sick child being driven to hospital, an imminent birth, or a medical professional rushing to a sick or elderly patient.  Access to cancel a fixed charge notice through 'Pulse' is restricted to users with the rank of Inspector or higher.</p><p>  The statistical information requested by the Deputy on the number of fixed penalty charges imposed and terminations in each Garda division for the 5 year period from 1/1/2008 to 31/12/2012 has been requested from the Garda Commissioner and, to the extent available in the format requested by the Deputy, will be forwarded to her as soon as possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-06a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030600062#WRA00800"><p>The Garda National Policing Plan for 2013, which I laid before the House last December, sets out the policing priorities and objectives for the current year.  The Plan is designed to meet the policing needs of all communities and includes objectives of particular relevance for rural areas, including active community engagement in the development of policing strategies and concerted efforts to support and protect vulnerable sections of the community.  The Garda Plan also outlines the Garda Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station and district network.   The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas. The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of our communities.  Nationally, it is anticipated that revised policing arrangements will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware from recent discussions on this issue,  until recently, the Garda station network was essentially the same as the RIC network which obtained in 1922.  Such a large-scale static deployment of resources is no longer appropriate, particularly as the transport and communications infrastructure has been transformed. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a class-leading police computer system, a state-of-the-art digital radio system and a transport fleet which is currently receiving significant investment. The centralisation of Garda services will facilitate the introduction of an enhanced grid patrolling system that will be operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system will ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country. Furthermore, the new Garda rostering arrangements which were implemented last year provide a better match between Garda availability and policing demand.</p><p>  I am, of course, aware of concerns in rural communities about the incidence of crime, and of burglary in particular and I am conscious of the deep distress which these crimes can cause to householders and of the broader impact in terms of the fear of crime in our communities. I therefore very much welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in this form of criminality.  This is principally being achieved through Operation Fiacla which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries.  The latest quarterly figures from the Central Statistics Office for burglary suggest that Operation Fiacla is having an impact, when compared with the quarterly figures prior to its introduction, and I am hopeful that the success of the operation will be continue to be reflected in future crime statistics as they become available.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>  I am informed that as of end February  2013, 4,226 persons have been arrested and 2,327 persons have been charged under Operation Fiacla, reflecting the extent of the operation and the impact it is having. </p><p>  It is the Government's intention to ensure that frontline services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources.  The Commissioner enjoys my full support and that of the Government in continuing to confront crime in all its forms.  I have every confidence that he and everyone in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deliver an effective police service in rural as in all other areas.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-06a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030600062#WRA01000"><p>In response to the need to raise awareness of violence against women among a wide audience Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, operates an annual awareness raising grant scheme. The scheme provides funding for local awareness raising campaigns that increase the understanding and recognition of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Grant applications are assessed according to specified criteria, including in particular the relevance of the project to the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2010-2014 and the level of joint/collaborative work involved in the proposed project. After the projects funded under the scheme  have completed their work Cosc evaluates  them. This evaluation is fed back to the Public Awareness Sub-Committee of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women.</p><p>  I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has updated its policies in relation to domestic and sexual violence in recent years. The policies are made available to all Garda members through the internal Garda portal.  I am informed that a wide range of training has been provided in recent years. New recruits have received general training. Members of specialist units such as the Child Pornography Unit and the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Units also receive specialised training. The B.A. Degree in Police Studies contains a comprehensive module on domestic violence. Relevant members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been instructed on sexual violence risk assessment tools in conjunction with the Probation Service. Specialist interviewers have been trained in  interviewing techniques in relation to child and vulnerable adult victims/witnesses of sexual and violent crimes.</p><p>  I understand that the Courts Service website allows family law practitioners, other justice sector professionals and lay people to access information on family law issues, including domestic violence. I am informed that the Courts Service also has a policy of making information publications of non-State service providers available in its information displays in court buildings. </p><p>  I understand that the Legal Aid Board has developed its website to provide better access to information on its role and services. The Board has produced a number of information leaflets including leaflets in relation to domestic violence and legal aid for complainants in rape and certain sexual assault cases. This information is available electronically on the website and in hard-copy in the Legal Aid Board offices.  </p><p>  Guidelines for working with perpetrators of sexual offences have been developed by the Probation Service and training has been provided to relevant staff as needed. The Probation Service has developed and published a domestic violence policy document and all staff have received training on the policy.  Through the existence of the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence and the co-ordinating work of Cosc a more coherent and strategic approach to awareness raising has emerged.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-06a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030600062#WRA01200"><p>I am interpreting the Deputy&#8217;s question in a broad manner so as to provide the information which I believe he is seeking. The term State Boards is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &#8220;Board&#8221;.  Details of the vacancies that occurred throughout the following 17 bodies during the period in question are set out below along with details of those cases where expressions of interest were sought from the public.</p><p><b><i>Censorship of Publications Board</i></b></p><p>Five vacancies occurred. I advertised for expressions of interest on 1st March 2013, closing date is 22nd March 2013.</p><p><b><i>Censorship of Publications Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>Five vacancies occurred. I advertised for expressions of interest on 1st March 2013, closing date is 22nd March 2013.</p><p><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management</i></b></p><p>One vacancy occurred.  The person appointed was a civil servant.</p><p><b><i>Courts Service Board</i></b></p><p>Fifteen vacancies occurred. The Courts Service Board has 17 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice. Of the 15 vacancies, three were filled by persons nominated by myself including a civil servant from my Department.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board</i></b></p><p>Four vacancies occurred and four appointments were made.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board</i></b></p><p>Nine vacancies occurred.  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only has a few outstanding cases on hands.  The 9th appointee is a civil servant.</p><p><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board</i></b></p><p>Three vacancies occurred and three appointments were made. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board consists of 10 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p><b><i>Legal Aid Board</i></b></p><p>Fourteen vacancies occurred. Of the 14 appointments to this Board, eight were civil or public servants.</p><p><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board</i></b></p><p>Three vacancies occurred and three appointments were made.</p><p><b><i>National Disability Authority</i></b></p><p>One vacancy occurred.  I made an appointment after seeking expressions of interest of which I received 12 applications.  This appointment was from a public applicant.</p><p><b><i>Parole Board</i></b></p><p>Six vacancies occurred and six appointments were made, two of those appointments were serving public servants.</p><p><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>Four vacancies occurred.  The Government appointed four people on 3rd April, 2012.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.</p><p><b><i>Private Security Authority</i></b></p><p>Eleven vacancies occurred. I invited expressions of interest for membership of a new Board. In total, twenty-nine expressions of interest were received - I am still considering the applications and expects to be in a position to make a decision shortly.  Although there are eleven vacancies on the Board, in accordance with the relevant legislation, four of these will be nominated representatives from my own Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Authority itself.</p><p><b><i>Property Registration Authority</i></b></p><p>Three vacancies occurred.  I made three appointments to the Authority, of which, in accordance with legislation, one is a nominee of the Law Society, one a nominee of the Bar Council and the 3rd, the elected Property Registration Authority staff representative.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Appeal Board - established 24th July 2012</i></b></p><p>Six vacancies occurred.  The Government made six appointments after seeking expressions of interest of which my Department received 41 applications.  Those appointed were public applicants. The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Regulatory Authority - established 3rd April 2012</i></b></p><p>Eleven vacancies occurred.  I made 11 appointments after seeking expressions of interest from members of the public.  I received 114 applications.  Nine of those appointed were public applicants, one is a civil servant and the Chairperson, who was a member of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Implementation Team, was appointed in order to provided continuity to the Authority which has operated on a non-statutory basis for a number of years. The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.</p><p><b><i>The Equality Authority</i></b></p><p>Fourteen vacancies occurred.  The outgoing Board of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment by me in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at end of July 2012, and therefore issues of selection did not arise. Three members of the outgoing Human Rights Commission, which is appointed by Government accepted reappointment from December 2011 until end May 2012. The Deputy will be aware that the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority are in the process of merging to form the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC). An independent selection process in relation to the membership of the new Commission is underway and members of the public were invited to apply. The intention is that the successful applicants will be appointed by myself and by Government to the two existing bodies, pending enactment of the necessary legislation to effect the merger. It is also intended that the successful applicants will meet with the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-06a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030600062#WRA01400"><p>I am aware of the report of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance and also of the fact that the report makes no allegation that such profiling is actually carried out.  This is not surprising given that an Garda Siochana do not engage in racial profiling.  The question of whether we should create a legislative prohibition therefore needs to be considered in that light.</p><p>  This is of course a complex matter.  Ireland has become a much more diverse society and indeed the nature of Irishness has evolved as many people from overseas have made their homes here.  At the same time immigration control is an important national interest and our laws must be enforced.  I believe however that it is perfectly possible to operate an effective system of immigration control without resorting to racial profiling but relying instead on good intelligence and the professional judgement and experience of our Gardai and immigration officers and indeed this has been demonstrated to be the case.  I will consider this matter further in the development of the Immigration Protection and Residence Bill which I propose to republish later this year.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  There are particular difficulties with the Supreme Court list which continues to experience lengthy waiting times now in excess of four years.  Waiting times for priority cases are 9-12 months at present and the Chief Justice has recently directed that no new cases be admitted to the priority list unless it can be clearly demonstrated that it is an exceptional case where there are urgent grounds necessitating a priority hearing.  Such urgent grounds would include appeals directly affecting the custody of an individual, child abduction, urgent family law matters, and appeals with urgent and systemic constitutional implications.</p><p>  Although considerable efforts are being made by the Chief Justice to manage waiting times, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the establishment of a Court of Appeal.  I recently announced my intention to establish a Court of Appeal with both criminal and civil jurisdiction.  The Government is committed to the holding of a Constitutional referendum on Article 34 which is necessary to achieve this and work has commenced in my Department in this regard.  It is intended that the referendum will take place, together with at least one other referendum, in the autumn. <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The proposed Amendment would, if passed, allow for the establishment of modern court structures including a Court of Appeal and a new family court structure.  These proposals have the potential to achieve significant change to the structure of our courts which have remained largely unchanged since 1924.</p></reply>

Despite the difficult financial situation that the country finds itself in, I have ensured that the 2013 budget for Cosc is unchanged from the 2012 budget amount. This will enable Cosc to continue its financial support of intervention programmes to enable them to operate. In 2012 Cosc provided grant assistance of the order of &euro;625,000 to the programmes.</p><p>  While the work that is done by the programmes involves direct interactions with men, the programmes have been developed in order to maximise the safety of female partners and ex-partners of the men on the programmes, and their children.  An important feature of programmes is the work that is done with partners and ex-partners by way of partner contact arrangements. All programmes have a dedicated partner contact element. A dedicated partner contact worker or workers  are engaged by the programme management to work with any partner or ex-partner of the men on the programme who wishes to be involved. This work informs the programme facilitators of the ongoing safety of the partners and children of the men on the programmes.</p><p>  There are weekly contacts between the partner contacts and the partners/ex-partners during which the man's behaviour in the preceding week is discussed and this information is then passed to the programme facilitator.  This allows the facilitators to challenge any man whose behaviour outside the programme is not matching his statements while attending the programme. The partner contact worker also provides practical support and advice to women in violent/controlling relationships.</p><p>  Under the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2010-2014, Cosc established a Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programme Committee to support the work of intervention programmes and to improve overall delivery of the programmes and their outcomes. The Committee is currently working towards this by:</p><p> - Developing uniform protocols and procedures to help strengthen co-operation and co-ordination between programmes and other relevant service providers</p><p> - Overseeing the collection and analysis of improved data to help with understanding who and why the programmes help as well as providing indicative data for outcomes research.</p><p>In recognition of the programmes' part in reducing domestic violence, a representative of the programmes has sat on the National Steering Committee on Violence against Women since the middle of 2012.</p></reply>

These Reports have detailed significant progress made across the more than 200 actions contained in the National Women&#8217;s Strategy 2007-2016. In my own Department, significant achievements should be noted in the areas of Violence against Women and Anti-Human Trafficking measures.</p><p>  Whilst acknowledging the progress made to date, it is important to recognise that much still needs to be done if we are to achieve de facto gender equality in Ireland. The National Women&#8217;s Strategy is an important instrument for achieving this aim and its stated Key Objectives are as relevant now as they were when the Strategy was published in 2007.  The Report outlining progress made in implementing the National Women&#8217;s Strategy during 2011 is complete and will be presented to Government shortly, and subject to the Government&#8217;s approval, it will be published at the earliest opportunity. The delay in this regard, while regrettable, has been due to work pressures associated with the ambitious Gender Equality Programme currently being undertaken as part of Ireland&#8217;s Presidency of the European Union.  A Mid-Term Review of the Strategy is also being finalised and I expect that this will be presented to Government at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

In 2010 the two police forces put in place a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.  The joint Cross Border Policing Strategy includes sections dealing with Operations; Cross Border Investigations; Intelligence-sharing and Security; Information and Communications Technology; Training; Human Resources, and Emergency Planning.  The two Forces are jointly engaged in implementing initiatives in all these areas.</p><p>  I meet and maintain contact very regularly with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to address matters of mutual concern and enhance effective co-operation and co-ordination on all criminal justice matters.  Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters we operate a structured framework to further develop this co-operation.  Officials from our Departments meet regularly to assess and report to us on developments in a number of areas where co-operation is pursued.  The two Justice Departments, the police authorities and the public prosecutors North and South have jointly developed and put in place a Joint Manual of Guidance for use in criminal investigations with a cross-border element.  The joint manual supports the police and prosecution authorities in both jurisdictions by ensuring that each side has an awareness of the needs of the other jurisdiction and can bear those in mind in conducting an investigation.  The joint manual allows them to maximise the chances of a successful detection and prosecution.</p><p>  The fight against the threat from paramilitary groups is a priority for both police services.  The Garda&iacute; co-operate seamlessly with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in actively bearing down on these criminal terrorists.  The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI who have responsibility for operational policing co-operation have repeatedly emphasised that the close and high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.</p><p>  I would emphasise that the joint Cross Border Policing Strategy recognises the particular value of interagency co-operation in certain areas, for example, in ongoing efforts to combat organised crime.  The Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling which comprises representatives from the two police forces, the two customs services, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency has underpinned successful actions which have disrupted the activities of a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels.  A similar interagency group, the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group, is in place to support the fight against the activities of gangs engaged in tobacco fraud.</p><p>  There is positive and dynamic North-South co-operation at policy and operational levels in combating crime.  The challenges that crime presents are shared ones on this island and joint working will continue to enhance efforts to improve community safety for all.</p></reply>

Upon receipt of a report from the Commissioner I will review the situation.  I understand that the officers carrying out the examination are continuing to keep the family members of the deceased updated on progress.  While I fully appreciate the concerns of the family, in any case where criminal behaviour is suspected it is only through a Garda investigation, and where evidence of criminal wrongdoing is available through the submission of a file by the Garda&iacute; to the Director of Public Prosecutions, that persons can be brought fully to account.  Therefore, I hope that the Deputy will agree that, in the first instance, we need to allow the present Garda examination to proceed to its conclusion.</p></reply>

The Deputy will note that total expenditure for 2012 represented a reduction of 10% over 2011.  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &euro;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  That significant reduction follows savings measures I introduced since coming into office including cuts to fees in the course of 2011. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid him/herself.  The Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act and the information sought by the Deputy regarding persons with prior convictions is therefore not recorded. </p><p>  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if he/she cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him/herself in person or through legal assistance of his/her own choosing or, if he/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  My overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts. </p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that a new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions will have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence,  to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.</p></reply>

Reform of the workplace relations institutions will involve the Equality Tribunal in a merger with the Labour Relations Commission, Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) (first instance functions) and National Employment Rights Authority to form a single agency for dealing with first instance complaints.

I have consulted with the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights and provided a detailed response to issues and questions raised with regard to the General Scheme by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). A high-level delegation met with the relevant OHCHR senior officials on 8 October 2012. This was a very positive meeting and addressed fully all the issues and concerns raised previously by the High Commissioner.  The OHCHR consider that Ireland has engaged in a good process in the development of the new Commission; has full confidence that the Government is approaching the issue in the right way and considers our approach as a best practice model for other countries.</p><p>  I am on record regarding my concerns in relation to the disproportionate budgetary cuts made to the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission in the past. I consider the fact that the provision for 2013 in the budget for the new IHREC of &euro;4.409m is a significant achievement given the current financial pressures on the public purse. This level of funding maintains the combined 2012 level of Exchequer grant-in-aid funding of both bodies and demonstrates the Government's strong commitment to strengthening our institutional framework for promotion and protection of human rights and equality.</p><p>  As a consequence of the merger of both bodies, bringing together and integrating two separate staff streams will be an initial task for the new Commission.  Also the new Commission will as a priority task undertake a review of staffing needs and prepare a business case for any essential additional staff. Again I am on record as saying this will have funding implications, but will be considered as favourably as possible even in the current extremely difficult climate.  The proposals in relation to functions as published  in the General Scheme are designed to give the new body a wide mandate in promoting equality and human rights while also giving it effective legal powers of protection and enforcement to address issues at a systemic level and to assist individuals in vindicating their rights.</p><p>  As regards the former National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism the new body will have a role in relation to integration issues with regard to migrants and also some of the functions of the Committee were subsequently absorbed into the  Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, an office of my Department.  In relation to direct reporting to the Oireachtas, I  would refer the Deputy to Heads 19 and 20 of the published General Scheme of the Bill which addresses this detail.</p></reply>

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.</p><p>The Garda Central Vetting Unit currently provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland which employ personnel to work in a full time part time, voluntary or student capacity with children and or vulnerable adults and who are registered with the Unit for this purpose. All organisations are aware of the processing time frames for the receipt of vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection processes. The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012. To ensure equity and fairness all applications are dealt with in chronological order from date of receipt.</p><p>It is my objective that processing times should be kept to a minimum, while maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system. In that regard, following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, sanction was recently granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Unit in the near future.  The Deputy may wish to note that Garda Central Vetting Unit will become the National Vetting Bureau under the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and will have a substantially expanded role under that legislation. I am currently engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in addressing the staffing issues relevant to the coming into force of the 2012 Act.</p></reply>

The moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service does not apply to the Garda Reserve, as members are volunteers and do not draw a salary. The Commissioner has carried out an internal review of the Reserve and has decided to extend their powers to include additional training in additional areas such as Domestic Violence, Child protection, Conflict Resolution, Garda policy on Bullying and Harassment, Out of Vehicle Safety Training (OVST), First Aid and Ample Probe Training. Continuous Professional Development courses continue to be provided annually to Garda Reserves on a Divisional basis. </p><p>  I would like to assure the House that the Government are fully committed to the continued development of the Garda Reserve.

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of demographics, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. </p><p>  One of the key elements of the 2013 Plan is that it sets out proposals for continuing the process of restructuring the way in which Garda services are organised and delivered, with the objective of enhancing the efficiency of the Force at a time of financial constraint.  This copperfastens the commitment of the Commissioner to smart policing in using available resources efficiently and effectively and ensuring that the maximum number of Garda personnel are available for front-line policing.  A specific example of this is the targeted use of resources under Operation Fiacla in dealing with burglaries. </p><p>  In that overall context I believe that the objectives set out in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013 will be achieved and that, despite the pressure on the public finances, it will be possible for the Force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities in a manner that will facilitate the presence of operational Garda&iacute; on patrol preventing and detecting crime.  The Garda Commissioner has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country. <font color="#000080">  </font>The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will continue to be provided to our communities.  The Garda Commissioner has also advised that closure of stations will result in some additional 61,000 patrolling hours being available for operational policing.</p><p>  I am confident that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to provide a professional policing service right across the country in a manner that is effective and is consistent with the highest standards for which the Force is renowned.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that addressing such criminality remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and these priorities are clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013 and in the Programme for Government. I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner about all aspects of serious crime and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to vigorously tackle organised crime through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations. Despite the challenges which they face, we should remember that week in, week out, the Garda&iacute; are successfully bringing people involved in gangland activities before the Courts, securing convictions and that a substantial number are presently serving their sentences in prison.</p><p>  The Garda approach involves targeting serious criminals and organised criminal groups on a number of fronts, including through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Serious and Organised Crime Unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau. These units are also supported, as required, by the Security and Intelligence Section which assists with the provision of intelligence briefings and timely information.</p><p>  Law enforcement efforts in this regard are underpinned by a comprehensive framework of criminal law measures. Whilst this current framework is being actively used to tackle organised crime the overall legislative response is being kept under review. In this regard my Department is currently undertaking a specific review of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 to see if its provisions can be strengthened and the views of the Garda Commissioner have been sought in this regard.  Furthermore, an Expert Group also established under the auspices of my Department, is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the Proceeds of Crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to strengthen the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.</p><p>  While there is already very strong anti-gangland legislation in place, I will continue to pursue important improvements to our overall legislative architecture. In this regard, the legislative priority for combating crime is the publication and enactment of a new Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill. This Bill represents a major step forward in the fight against serious crime.  It will lead to the establishment, for the first time, of a national DNA database in Ireland.  Finally I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that, if he feels there are other measures which might be taken in this area, then I will look at that very positively.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-06a.82.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030600064#WRC01100"><p>This question relates to the issue surrounding the allegations concerning the cancellation of Fixed Charge Notices.  Fixed Charge Notices are provided for under the Road Traffic Act, 2002 and are an alternative to prosecution.  They give a motorist the opportunity to acknowledge the offence, pay the fixed charge and, where the offence is a penalty point offence, incur the appropriate penalty points.  While the issuing of a Fixed Charge Notice does not constitute commencement of legal proceedings, it normally leads to a prosecution if the fixed charge is not paid.</p><p>  There can be circumstances, however, where the Fixed Charge Notice may be cancelled, in accordance with Garda procedures drawn up in the light of legislative exemptions and prosecutorial guidelines.  Cancellation occurs where it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair or proportionate.  The procedures provide authority to District Officers, or Inspectors Acting as District Officers, and an Inspector in the Fixed Charge Processing Office to cancel Fixed Charge Notices.  Cancellation can occur in circumstances where, for example, exemptions apply in relation to emergency vehicles or the wearing of seatbelts, or where there are evidential difficulties, such as where the registration number registered by a speed camera does not correspond to the vehicle in question, or where there are emergency medical circumstances such as, for example, a sick child being driven to hospital, an imminent birth, or a medical professional rushing to a sick or elderly patient.  Access to cancel a fixed charge notice through 'Pulse' is restricted to users with the rank of Inspector or higher.</p><p>  Allegations concerning the cancellation of fixed charge notices are being examined by an Assistant Commissioner who is due to report his findings shortly.  I have received an interim report from the Commissioner, but I will not be making any further comment on any allegations until the final report is available, which I have been informed by the Commissioner will be in two weeks time.  It would be premature and wrong to assume that the cancellation of fixed charge notices were inappropriate.</p></reply>

Both organisations, as public bodies, are concerned that employees rights are protected.  When tendering for services both organisations makes use of standard templates issued by the NPS prepared by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  Potential service providers are reminded, under the terms and conditions of the tender documentation, that they are required to have taken account of their legal obligations relating to employment protection and working conditions in the provision of services sought and that the employment status, remuneration, taxes, immigration and work permits of all personnel retained for the purposes of providing services are their sole responsibility in law.</p><p>  In this regard, tenderers must, when submitting their bid, provide a statement confirming that they have taken account of these legal obligations relating to employment protection and working conditions.  Failure to do so renders the tender submission non-compliant and excludes them from further consideration for the provision of services. Tenderers are also required to include an undertaking to comply fully with Council Directive 2001/23/EC relating to the safeguarding of employee's rights in the event of transfer of undertakings and to indemnify the contracting Authority for any claim arising or loss incurred as a result of its failure or incapacity to fulfil its obligations. Once contracts are in place, any reported breaches of rights would be taken up with the employer.</p></reply>

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present. </p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and following the committee's recent announcement, three JobBridge interns have this week been appointed in order to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts. </p><p>  The ISIS committee also announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues, in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  In addition, on 25 February last, the ISIS Committee and the Committee for Judicial Studies hosted a lecture given by Lord Justice Colman Treacy on Sentencing Guidelines, focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council of England and Wales.  I understand that it is the intention of those Committees to host further events of this nature in the future. </p><p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.</p></reply>

As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.  </p><p>  In November 2011, the judiciary agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill. A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill, a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010. The observations of the sub-committee were conveyed to me by the Chief Justice on 8 May 2012. These observations were duly considered in my Department taking account of intervening developments and of current Government policy. Following this consideration, I conveyed the relevant drafting instructions to the Attorney General in November 2012.  Work on the drafting of the new Bill continues, therefore, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel and I very much appreciate the ongoing support being given to this initiative by the Chief Justice and her judicial colleagues. Under the Government's Legislation Programme for the Spring Session, announced by the Chief Whip on 15 January 2013, publication of the Bill is expected later this year.</p></reply>

The Bill provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State.  This and the other aspects of the Bill raised by the Deputy are among those to which we are giving detailed consideration at this time, including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel.</p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members including those being raised by the Deputy on this occasion.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the joint committee.  Work on the Bill continues on that basis while taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the courts.  It remains my objective under this new approach, and mindful of our having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to the Government for approval and publication later this year.</p></reply>

As of 17 February 2013, there are 4,819 residents in 35 direct provision accommodation centres contracted to the RIA throughout the State.  I am aware of the recommendations made in relation to the direct provision system in the fourth monitoring report of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance on Ireland which was published on 19 February 2013.  I have explained in detail in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions the reasons the direct provision system was introduced in 1999 when the structures in place were entirely unsuited to the situation then pertaining.  A new system was necessary to prevent widespread homelessness among asylum seekers.  I have also explained that residents and their children have the same medical and educational entitlements as Irish citizens and, as well as their full board costs being met, can apply to Community Welfare Officers for assistance to meet a particular once-off need by way of an exceptional needs payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  The system remains a necessary feature of the State's asylum and immigration system.  I acknowledge that the length of time spent in the direct provision system is an issue to be addressed.</p><p>  On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings.  All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996.  High-quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that people who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.  This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process.  The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource-intensive.  There are no quick or easy decisions to make.  Given the life-changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.</p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, which I intend to republish, provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State.  This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements.  This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  Further, I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel of people with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases, thereby speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system.  I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months.</p></reply>

They give a motorist the opportunity to acknowledge the offence, pay the fixed charge and, where the offence is a penalty point offence, incur the appropriate penalty points.  While the issuing of a Fixed Charge Notice does not constitute commencement of legal proceedings, it normally leads to a prosecution if the fixed charge is not paid.</p><p>  There can be circumstances, however, where the Fixed Charge Notice may be cancelled, in accordance with Garda procedures drawn up in the light of legislative exemptions and prosecutorial guidelines.  Cancellation occurs where it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair or proportionate.  The procedures provide authority to District Officers, or Inspectors Acting as District Officers, and an Inspector in the Fixed Charge Processing Office to cancel Fixed Charge Notices.  Cancellation can occur in circumstances where, for example, exemptions apply in relation to emergency vehicles or the wearing of seatbelts, or where there are evidential difficulties, such as where the registration number registered by a speed camera does not correspond to the vehicle in question, or where there are emergency medical circumstances such as, for example, a sick child being driven to hospital, an imminent birth, or a medical professional rushing to a sick or elderly patient.  Access to cancel a fixed charge notice through 'Pulse' is restricted to users with the rank of Inspector or higher.</p><p>  Allegations concerning the cancellation of fixed charge notices are being examined by an Assistant Commissioner who is due to report his findings shortly.  I have received an interim report from the Commissioner, but I will not be making any further comment on any allegations until the final report is available, which I have been informed by the Commissioner will be in two weeks time.  It would be premature and wrong to assume that the cancellation of fixed charge notices were inappropriate.  Let us await the final report on this matter, which I expect shortly, and we will then be in a position to draw conclusions.</p></reply>

The Garda Policing Plan for 2013 sets out the Commissioner's proposals to amalgamate a number of Garda Districts, including the Gorey and Enniscorthy Districts. The Commissioner&rsquo;s priority in introducing the changes in the 2013 Policing Plan was to ensure the continued delivery of an effective policing service throughout the country and ensure that Garda resources are deployed to meet the existing and projected policing requirements within all Divisions in 2013, including the Wexford Division.</p><p>  The amalgamation of Garda Districts into larger Districts will allow for the more flexible deployment of resources and provide improved economies of scale in terms of administration.  The Garda Commissioner has stated that, whilst the revised structures will further enhance operational capacity, they will also continue to support the Garda community policing philosophy.  The revised District arrangements for the Wexford Division are aimed at freeing up Garda personnel from desk duties so that they are out with communities, engaging in frontline policing.  In that context, I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the amalgamation of the Gorey and Enniscorthy Garda Districts will lead to improved efficiencies in the delivery of the policing service currently provided within the Wexford Garda Division.</p></reply>

We strongly believe that sustainable development can only be achieved by ensuring a strong human rights foundation. That is why the Government places such an emphasis on the promotion of human rights in its poverty eradication efforts in developing countries.  Through our overseas aid programme we support the promotion of human rights in developing countries in a number of important ways. Active engagement with and support for civil society is a key aspect of this work. Of Ireland&rsquo;s total aid budget of &euro;623 million this year, about a quarter will be channelled through civil society organisations to support their valuable work in advancing human rights, whether civil and political, or economic, social and cultural.</p><p>  Specific funding is also provided for human rights work in Ireland&rsquo;s nine Programme Countries. This supports the work of Governments for example in ensuring the rule of law, National Human Rights Institutions, non-governmental organisations and others in promoting and protecting human rights, especially for the most vulnerable. Overall funding for governance in our Programme Countries amounted to over &euro;27.5 million in 2011, equivalent to 15% of our total spend there.</p><p>  At the global level, support is provided for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which plays a pivotal role in overseeing major programmes in protecting human rights and implementing international rights agreements. &euro;2 million was provided for the Office of the High Commissioner by Ireland in 2012. We also support the Irish Human Rights Commission for its work with National Human Rights Institutions in Sierra Leone and Malawi.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s current membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council provides a further opportunity to play a vibrant and strong role in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide. We remain committed to a strong multilateral human rights system which can impartially monitor the implementation of human rights norms. In particular, Ireland is championing the UN Universal Periodic Review mechanism which reviews all member states&rsquo; human rights records.</p><p>  At the European Union level too, Ireland is playing a full an active part in ensuring human rights are advanced in developing countries. Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s determination to promote human rights and democracy through all its external actions. Ireland, together with other EU Member States and the European Commission, agreed an EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy last year. By working together effectively in promoting human rights, we believe our impact will be greater.</p></reply>

The legislation provides for the possibility of full or partial deferral in certain defined circumstances to qualified liable persons, and in such circumstances, the interest is 4% per annum.  The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  Details of the deferral arrangements are available on Revenue's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>, where the Revenue Commissioners have recently published a useful Guide to Local Property Tax.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for those who do not qualify for deferral of the tax, there is a wide range of payment options available to liable persons, which will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full or to pay the tax in equal instalments beginning in July 2013 by direct debit or by deduction at source from employment income, occupational pension or certain payments for the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In these circumstances, no interest will be charged.</p><p>  I am satisfied that Revenue will make it as easy as possible for people to comply with their obligations and facilitate the vast majority of liable persons who, I believe, will wish to pay their LPT charge.  However, for those residential property owners who are not prepared to pay, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the interests of fairness and equity to the compliant taxpayer who pays their LPT, follow-up action will be taken to recover the tax from those liable persons as soon as possible.  Revenue will pursue payment of the Revenue Estimate, which is an estimate of the LPT due and applies where the liable person has failed to submit their LPT Return, including by way of mandatory deduction from 1 July 2013 from the liable person's employment income, occupational pension or certain Government payments.  In such circumstances, payment of interest will not arise assuming no additional liability arises.</p></reply>

These can include mortgage-to-rent, trade-down mortgages, equity participation, interest rate reduction, split mortgages and sale by agreement, or other appropriate options as may be developed by lenders.  The split mortgage is one of a number of arrangements suggested by the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group Report (the Keane Report) and involves splitting a distressed mortgage into an affordable mortgage and warehousing the balance.</p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that the majority of the lenders have introduced or are in the process of introducing a split mortgage arrangement.  While lenders have taken on board the broad approach set out in the Keane report, the product details vary from lender to lender. The most notable difference involves the interest rate charged on the warehoused element of the split mortgage which, I am informed, varies from 0% up to the full mortgage interest rate.  Central Bank statistics indicate that at the end of September 2012, which is currently the latest statistical data available, twelve split mortgages were in place.  However, long term options are now being rolled out and the Central Bank has informed me that data being published as part of its quarterly mortgage arrears and repossession statistics for the end of 2012 and throughout 2013 will show progress in this area.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that write-downs of residential mortgages are agreed on a case by case basis and are not disclosed by the covered banks. However general information on the accounting write-offs of the covered banks is set out in their annual and interim reports.</p></reply>

Any claims, over and above that described above, will rank as an unsecured claim in the liquidation process.</p><p>  There are standard rules which apply to the distribution of the assets of companies in liquidation and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere with these rules.  However the State does intervene to ensure that statutory redundancy is available through the Social Insurance Fund and that arrears of pay, sick pay, holiday pay or pay in lieu of statutory notice (limited to EUR600 per week up to a maximum of eight weeks) are payable from the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  The Minister for Social Protection will rank as a preferential creditor of IBRC in respect of any payments made to employees of IBRC from the Social Insurance Fund or the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  Any action taken by the Minister which might divert the assets from IBRC creditors to employees could be challenged in the Courts.  I have been advised by the special liquidators that that any voluntary severance scheme, that was in place prior to liquidation, is no longer operational.</p><p>  The special liquidators have said that it is their key priority that all employees are fully kept up to date on all developments during the course of the special liquidation. They have indicated that their approach will be to talk with employees directly either in small groups or on a one to one basis and they also plan to communicate by email general updates to employees during the course of the special liquidation.</p></reply>

With regard to an estimated comparison of the new arrangement with the Promissory Notes previously, any calculation of cost would be based on a number of assumptions, including what assumed interest would prevail and assumptions around future refinancing rates, all of which will depend upon the outcome of uncertain future events.  These assumptions can have a material impact on the ultimate valuations and are subject to a wide range of possible outcomes.

I can advise the Deputy that officials within my Department met with the IBOA last month and issues surrounding the status of the employees of the IBRC (in liquidation) were discussed.  The special liquidator has advised that there is ongoing interaction between the IBOA and the Special Liquidators.

The Local Property Tax (LPT) does not come into effect until 1 July 2013.  The Government decided to extend the NPPR Charge into 2013 to ensure as smooth a transition as possible for local authorities, pending the introduction of the full LPT.  The inter-Departmental Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill on the design of a property tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) recommended that the NPPR Charge should be absorbed into the LPT as a separate (supplemental) tax, at the existing level (currently &euro;200) applying to non-principal private residences.  However, the Government that, while the NPPR Charge will be collected in 2013, when a half-year LPT will also apply, it should be discontinued thereafter.

Where a property is owned by more than one person, the owners are jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax.  This means that Revenue can pursue one person for the full liability and payment by that person discharges the tax liability of all joint owners.  For the purposes of completing an LPT Return, joint owners are required to agree a valuation for the property.  A single Return should be submitted on behalf of the joint owners. If the LPT is not paid, the Revenue Commissioners can proceed to collect the tax from any of the owners.</p><p>  An exemption from the charge to LPT is available where a residential property was previously occupied by a person as his or her sole or main residence and has been vacated by the person for 12 months or more due to long term mental or physical infirmity and is not occupied by any other person.  However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the exemption will not apply in this particular case as the parent and children own the property jointly therefore they are jointly and severally liable for the tax.</p><p>  The Non-Principal Private Residence (NPPR) Charge is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am informed by the Minister that the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.  The NPPR charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge.  A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the NPPR charge. In respect of a residential property that is co-owned by several persons, such as a parent and his or her children, each co-owner is jointly and severally liable for the charge.</p><p>  Section 4(5) of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides an exemption in cases where a property is vacated due to illness, including an incapacity brought about by infirmity due to old age.  However, as the specific property in this instance is shared between four liable owners and liability is joint and severable, based on the information provided it would seem that the three sibling co-owners would be liable for the NPPR charge.  Should there be any doubt concerning the application of the provisions of the 2009 Act in specific circumstances, legal advice is recommended.</p><p>  Under the 2009 Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that following receipt of data from the DSP in late 2011 containing details of DSP pension payments, it emerged that some pensioners with significant other income had not previously declared their DSP pension for tax purposes.  Revenue&rsquo;s approach was, firstly, to ensure that the record was correct for 2012 and thereafter to examine in detail the largest cases where there was a mismatch between their records and the DSP record, beginning with cases where annual non-DSP income exceeded &euro;50,000.  In the case of a couple in a marriage or civil partnership, the combined non-DSP income of both spouses is considered for this purpose.</p><p>  The information obtained from the initial examination informed Revenue approach to other high risk cases.  This follow-up project has been ongoing and Revenue is now corresponding with taxpayers who did not declare their DSP pension where they have annual non-DSP income of between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000.  The Commissioners also advise that this correspondence gives the taxpayers in question an opportunity to engage with Revenue, and, for example, to claim any unclaimed tax reliefs such as medical expenses for themselves and their spouse.  </p></reply>

The Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p><p>  My Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. Other P.E. facilities e.g. pitches are provided, where appropriate and in the context of available resources, as part of the Department's school building programme. The provision of playing pitches is not part of the specification for primary schools. However, in certain circumstances and where the site conditions allow, the project scope may include the levelling and grassing of an area which schools may decide to use for playing fields. At post primary level, an area may be developed as a practice playing field where site conditions and resources permit.</p><p>  In the context of my Department's co-operation with local authorities in identifying suitable sites for schools, the location of sporting facilities is one factor taken into account in locating schools. The Deputy may be aware of my Department's role in developing shared community facilities in the Fingal County Council area, which has made facilities available to the wider community on a shared basis with the school.</p><p>  Given the current financial constraints within which my Department is operating, priority is being given to applications from schools for essential mainstream classroom accommodation. In this regard, my Department is not in a position to consider applications from schools for funding towards pitches or sports facilities outside of the context of school projects on the building programme. My Department will however continue to provide general purpose rooms, PE Halls and outdoor play areas in schools where new schools are being provided within the context of available funding.  It is open to local communities to liaise directly with schools regarding the potential use of school facilities after school hours.</p></reply>

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers.</p><p>  Following a review of the operation of the subsidiary and supplementary panel arrangements in the 2012/13 school year and in order to enable the redeployment process to operate in a more efficient manner a number of changes are being introduced with effect from the 2013/14 school year.  All eligible applicants who meet the eligibility criteria will be placed on the relevant supplementary panels. There will no longer be separate subsidiary panels.  The Subsidiary and Supplementary Special National Panels are being phased out and no new applications are being accepted. This decision by the Department reflects the wider availability of primary teachers who are qualified to work in all settings which was not the case when this panel was originally set up.</p><p>  Access to the Supplementary Special National Panel for the 2013/14 school year will be confined to those teachers who were on the Subsidiary or Supplementary Special National Panels in the 2012/13 school year and who did not secure a permanent teaching post. My Department has contacted these teachers directly. A further change is that the Supplementary Special National Panel for the 2013/14 school year will be used only for filling permanent teaching posts in special schools that are not otherwise required for the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers.  The arrangements for panel access for fixed term (temporary), substitute and part-time teachers for the 2013/14 school year are set out in Circular 0038/2012 which is available on the Department website.</p></reply>

Its research provides a valuable input to the development of course curricula and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address emerging skills needs.  The Springboard programme targets funding of free part time higher education courses for unemployed people in areas where there are identified skills shortages.  More than 10,000 places have been provided under the two rounds of the programme to date.  A new call for proposals for courses to be run under the programme in 2013 issued to higher education providers at the end of February.</p><p>  The joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan has been developed as a direct response to identified ICT skills shortages and contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, including through the roll out of graduate skills conversion courses.  In February 2013 more than 760 new places were made available on the conversion courses in higher education institutions around the country.  This is in addition to the more than 700 places that were provided in 2012.  6,500 training places are currently being rolled out for unemployed people under the Momentum programme.  The training, which is aligned up to levels 5 and 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications, is targeted at areas of labour market demand and there is a particular focus on the needs of unemployed people under the age of 25.  Funding is also provided to Skillnets, where the development of training is led by representatives of industry ensuring that training provision meets the needs of the sector.</p><p>  In addition, a range of recommendations to ensure the system continues to respond to enterprise needs is being implemented through the National Strategy for Higher Education.  The creation of a new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will also ensure a focus on the evolving skills requirements of industry.</p></reply>

The QNHS shows that there was an overall increase in employment year-on-year across the economy of 1,200 people.  While this is a modest increase in overall terms, it is the first annual increase in employment recorded since the Second Quarter of 2008.  This follows on from seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter increases in employment of 3,900 in Quarter 2 2012, and 2,200 in Quarter 3 2012.</p><p>  The reference, in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, to a reduction of 400 employees in the private sector seems to relate to Table A3 of the QNHS.  This table provides an indication of the number of employees in the public sector and the private sector, based on the CSO&rsquo;s Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey.  However, the figures published in this table do not include all persons in employment in the private sector.  For example, they exclude employees in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries sector, and those who are self-employed.  Figures provided elsewhere in the QNHS show an increase in employment in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries sector year-on-year.  The number of people who are self-employed also increased year-on-year.  There may, of course be some overlap between these two categories.</p><p>  What is clear is that the number of people employed in the public sector, as set out in Table A3, has declined considerably as part of the Government&rsquo;s Public Sector Reform Plan, while employment numbers are increasing in the private sector, as reflected in the headline QNHS figures.  In addition, the increase in employment numbers in the private sector which are referenced in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 are supported by the job creation figures of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, who between them supported the creation of almost 10,000 net extra jobs in 2012.  Employment also increased in sectors outside the normal remit of the enterprise agencies, such as wholesale and retail.</p></reply>

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs considered an action plan for the introduction of such a system at meetings in December 2012 and January 2013 and agreed that an integrated licensing system for the retail sector be delivered by the end of this year.

Such an integrated licensing system is a reformative step in reducing the administrative burdens for business.</p><p>  Delivering an integrated licensing system, in the first instance for the retail sector, will require the firm and ongoing commitment and engagement of the relevant licensing authorities to work closely with my Department and with Forf&aacute;s.  A list of 30 core licences for the retail sector have been identified for the initial stages of this project involving up to 16 licensing authorities.  My colleague, Minister John Perry, has invited all these authorities at the highest level to become members of the Steering Group for this project; the Steering Group will begin meeting shortly. Minister Perry will chair this group.</p><p>  Furthermore, an audit of the statutory obligations and required administrative processes of those core licences identified for the retail sector is underway.  This audit includes: a review of all the information that is required for each licence in terms of application, renewal and compliance; an assessment/understanding of the current systems for approval, authorisation, record keeping, security and personnel engaged; further analysis to identify those licences that can be amalgamated/integrated, and a review of the current underpinning IT frameworks.  The outputs of this audit process will inform whether any legislative change is required as well as the definition of an integrated licence management system that will include the technical infrastructure design, the detailed system design and security and risk analysis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-06a.332.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013030600064#WRO00800"><p>Invalidity pension section currently has 88 claims awaiting an initial decision for a period in excess of two years.  It is not possible to provide an exact breakdown of these cases but it is reasonable to believe that the majority of these are cases which fall to be decided under EU regulations or bi-lateral agreements.  These cases are more complex and take considerably longer to process.  Invalidity pension section has been involved in a business process improvement review and backlog elimination programme.  This programme has led to a significant reduction in the number of invalidity pension claims awaiting decision, down from 7,007 claims at end May 2012 to 2593 claims at the end of February 2013.  In addition, new claims are now processed on receipt with a decision being made based on information provided or, if this is not possible, further medical evidence or additional information is requested and a decision is made on receipt.</p><p>As a consequence of the very high number of decisions made in the last 9 months, there has been a corresponding substantial increase in the number of appeals being received.  Invalidity pension section is now focussed on reducing the backlog in the appeals area.  Illness benefit section currently has no claims pending on the system for a period in excess of two years.  With regard to appeals in both schemes, the number of open appeals of illness benefit and invalidity pension registered on or before 4 March 2011 is given in the table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Scheme Type</th><th>No. of appeals registered before 4th March, 2011</th><th>No. registered before 4th March, 2011 as a  percentage of total of Appeals open</th></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td><div>185</div></td><td><div>13.8%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity</td><td><div>66</div></td><td><div>1.6%</div></td></tr></table></p><p>These represent the most protracted cases.  Appeals where medical grounds are identified as an issue under appeal are referred in the first instance to the Department's medical assessors for a second medical assessment and any further investigation, examination or assessment that is deemed necessary.  If, after a second medical examination, an applicant is still deemed not to meet the qualifying criteria, the appeal proceeds by assignment to an appeals officer.  Delays have developed in the processing of medical assessments and reviews due to a combination of factors including the increased workload for medical assessors and the reduced number of medical assessors due to retirements.  The Department is addressing this issue and has recently run a competition to establish a new panel of medical assessors.  Three new medical assessors were appointed from this panel and all commenced work in November 2012.  It is expected that a further 8 medical assessors will be appointed from the panel in the near future.</p><p>By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial process, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that while every effort is made to deal with appeals as fast as possible this cannot be at the expense of fairness or due process.  Processing times of appeals reduced by 10.3 weeks overall in 2012 as compared to 2011.  Of course, further improvement is needed.  In that regard, the Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  There were 32,558 cases finalised in 2012.  Any undue delays in the claim and appeal process are regretted.  The Department has and will continue to implement measures to reduce the waiting time for applicants and appellants.</p></reply>

The threat response plan will incorporate measures intended to cease, avoid, reduce or prevent threats, pressures or hazards that may be having an adverse effect on the conservation status of a species of bird referred to in Article 1 of the Birds Directive and/or causing the deterioration of the habitats of species for which a Special Protection Area has been classified pursuant to the Birds Directive.</p><p>  The development of a threat response plan for the conservation of Hen Harrier in Ireland is underway and my Department is currently engaged in a procurement process to secure the necessary support in order to undertake this process in a timely and efficient manner. My Department will be working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in exploring the areas of overlap between the conservation of habitat for the Hen Harrier and the forestry and agricultural sectors in the location referred to by the Deputy, with a view to finding practicable and manageable solutions to reverse the significant Hen Harrier population declines that have been recorded.

Decisions relating to the provision of broadband services in any particular area, including the upgrading of telephone exchanges, are commercial decisions for the commercial service providers.  I have no statutory power to compel any service provider to offer higher levels of broadband service at any particular location.  </p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.  </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan commits the Government to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  This will ensure that citizens or businesses, wherever they are located, have a broadband connection which meets their needs to interact effectively with society and business in a global digital environment.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Carraroe, County Sligo, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.    </p></reply>

The technologies being supported include anaerobic digestion and combined heat and power, which will also contribute to our renewable heat targets.  It also contains incentives for co-firing of biomass in peat powered generation plants with a premium for the use of energy crops such as miscanthus and willow.  The scheme operates by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable electricity generated and sent to the grid over a 15 year period.  The scheme does not set out a tariff price for biomass itself which is a contractual matter between biomass supplier and the electricity generator.  The REFIT schemes are funded through the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy which is paid for by all electricity consumers.  I do not have any plans at this time to open any new REFIT schemes or to adjust the schemes currently in existence with respect to any particular feedstock.</p></reply>

The aim is to attract matching funding from the private sector, such that the overall amount available for investment is greater than &euro;70 million.  NewEra has been asked by Government to coordinate establishment of the Fund and ensure it is appropriately managed.  It has been meeting with sector participants and parties with experience in making and managing investments in the energy efficiency sector. </p><p>  The Fund will be supported by the creation of a National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework (the Framework), which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing the investment-ready projects.  Work on the Framework is well advanced with a public/private group established late last year.  The first version of the Framework will be published in early April this year. </p><p>  I anticipate that NewEra will shortly conclude the process of stakeholder engagement and move to formalise interest in the Fund&rsquo;s establishment.

The remit of the local government system in Ireland is unduly narrow.  However, through a comprehensive reform process, which encompasses the development of capacity and strategic collaboration with stakeholders such as local development bodies, the sector can respond to the significant international evidence that local government should assume a leadership role in fostering local collaboration for economic and social development.</p><p>  A range of economic and enterprise supports are currently provided through a number of different programmes, delivery bodies and local governance structures at local level.  For many years, local authorities have been engaged in promoting local economic development; County and City Enterprise Boards have had lead responsibility locally for micro-enterprise development, while certain aspects of the LEADER programmes have also promoted local economic development through supports for businesses and entrepreneurs.</p><p>  As a key part of Government&rsquo;s overall response to the current jobs crisis, it is necessary to intensify our responses at local level.  This can be achieved through the integration of all local economic and enterprise supports within a single integrated local and economic development system.  The Government decision to establish Local Enterprise Offices in local authorities, which will be complemented by a greater integration of local government and local development economic and enterprise supports, will facilitate an improved co-ordination of efforts locally.  It will see the dynamism and innovative capacity of County and City Enterprise Boards and LEADER companies combined with the institutional capacity of local government to provide a strong platform for economic development locally, and it will streamline supports for business and entrepreneurs at local level.</p></reply>

This resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to approximately &euro;314m on the basis of the Programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013.</p><p>  In this context the original funding allocations given to each Local Development Company (LDC) contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP required readjustment. My Department is currently carrying out an exercise to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all measures in order to complete the rebalancing of the programme in as equitable a way as possible. The original allocations to Mayo North East LEADER Partnership and South West Mayo Development Company were some &euro;10.752 million and &euro;12.150 million respectively.   </p><p>  In addition, given the levels of spending by the LDCs from 2009 to date it is very unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013. The co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond the end of 2013 and will therefore have a knock on effect on the overall Programme requirement.  Once the rebalancing exercise as outlined above has been satisfactorily completed decisions will then be made regarding definitive allocations and the resumption of new project approvals.</p></reply>

The national response to the problem of drug misuse is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016. The Strategy provides a co-ordinated and comprehensive response to the problem and is founded on a partnership approach.  Under this partnership approach all of the relevant statutory agencies work closely with the community and voluntary treatment sectors in tackling the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs. This collaborative approach is reflected in all of the working structures established under the national drugs policy framework.  The Strategy, which is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague Minister of State at the Department of Health Mr. Alex White T.D., adopts a pillar based approach to the problem, involving the implementation of a wide range of measures across the five pillars of drug supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</p><p>  Significant Government resources continue to be allocated to tackling drug misuse. In addition to the considerable resources provided to the statutory services, including health, education and criminal justice authorities, in dealing with drugs issues as a part of their normal day to day services, the Department of Health also administers a Drugs Initiative Programme. This Programme, which primarily funds community based drugs initiatives supported by the Drugs Task Forces, currently has available to it in excess of &euro;28m for 2013.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the involvement of my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Strategy is primarily, although not exclusively, concerned with the drug supply pillar. In this regard, drug law enforcement remains a key priority area.  This is reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan for 2013 which highlights a strong focus in combating serious crime in all its forms, in particular organised crime and its close links with drug trafficking.  Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also involved in a wide range of collaborative work involving community interests including, for example, the work of the local and regional Drugs Task Forces, the work of the Joint Policing Committees and community initiatives such as the work being undertaken, in partnership with the Family Support Network organisation, in tackling the problem of intimidation associated with drug related debts.</p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to strongly affirm the Government's steadfast commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse. This important work will continue to be progressed in partnership with all relevant stakeholders and will continue to include ongoing active community participation in addressing this complex problem. </p></reply>

The aim of the Programme was to help encourage increased tourism from growing markets.  Therefore, in devising the Programme, officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department consulted with tourism interests, both State and private, to identify those markets with the greatest potential for growth.  On the other hand, a threshold for a successful rate of visa applications of 93% over a twelve-month period was applied for countries to be considered for inclusion in the Programme, this being the average success rate at the time for visa applications. The setting of such a threshold is a common feature of visa waiver programmes worldwide (e.g. for the USA the threshold is 95%).  Neither Albania nor Macedonia met this criterion at the time of the setting up of the Programme and the figures for 2012 indicate that they remain below the threshold.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that work has been ongoing, through the regular Common Travel Area Forum (CTAF) meetings between the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the UK Home Office and UK Border Agency, on the development of reciprocal short-stay Common Travel Area (CTA) visa arrangements.  These arrangements would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA, with first arrival in either Ireland or the UK, and to travel freely between the two jurisdictions.</p><p>  In relation to the countries that are visa-required, there are, in fact, very few differences between the two jurisdictions. There are only seven countries for whose citizens Ireland requires a visa for travel for which the UK do not.  Conversely, there are ten countries for whose citizens the UK requires a visa but Ireland does not.  Discussions on visa alignment are ongoing under the auspices of the CTAF Forum.</p><p>  Neither Ireland nor the UK is bound by the provisions of the Commission Proposal COM (2012) 650.  However, it should be noted that, of the proposed list of sixteen countries and five categories of British citizens for whom of the visa requirement will be lifted (in respect of those countries bound by the Proposal), all but four - East Timor, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau - are already, and have been for some time, visa-free for travel to Ireland.  It should be noted that, in 2012, the total number of visit visa applications to Ireland from the six countries in question was 33, of which 25 were from Namibia.  Therefore, it is very unlikely that lifting of the visa requirement would have any notable impact on tourist numbers.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances. The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.</p><p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are currently 31 vehicles allocated to the Cork North Division,  7 of which are allocated to the Mallow District. Garda management closely monitors the allocation of all policing resources and operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure that the optimum use is made of available resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. In addition, the Garda authorities have informed me that the current policing arrangements for the Cork North Division make the best use of available resources.  Moreover, the Garda authorities have indicated that the needs of the Division will continue to be examined as additional resources become available.</p><p>  In that context, the Deputy will be aware that I made an additional &euro;3 million available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year which enabled the Force to procure an additional 171 vehicles, bringing the total number of vehicles procured in 2012 to 213.  The roll out of these vehicles to Garda Divisions throughout the country is ongoing and, in that context, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that 31 of the vehicles are being allocated to the Garda Southern Region which includes the Cork North Division. These vehicles are being deployed in line with operational requirements. A further allocation of &euro;5 million has been provided for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in 2013.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to provide an effective and efficient policing service.</p></reply>

Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail. I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.</p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public. My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided. I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.</p><p>  I will bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities. Insofar as the question of revocation of Bail by the courts is concerned, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics. However, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me court statistics are not maintained in the manner sought by the Deputy.</p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics in relation to offences committed while on Bail directly to the Deputies.</p></reply>

This operation is running in conjunction with national operations such as Operation Fiacla and other Garda operations in existence to combat criminality within the Donegal Division. The main focus of the operation, which is ongoing, is to disrupt and prevent criminality against older persons within the community,  to apprehend suspects in the commission and the attempted commission of offences, and to fully investigate, detect and prosecute any offences outstanding against those suspects and groups.  This will be achieved through a focused, targeted and coordinated approach by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  The objectives of the operation are being addressed through intelligence led patrols, checkpoints, continued liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), intelligence gathering and the continued support and rejuvenation of Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes.

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of demographics, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The Garda budget for 2013 is &euro;1.412 billion which is a significant amount of money despite the financial constraints under which we operate.</p><p>  In relation to Garda numbers, these have been reducing due to the moratorium on recruitment introduced by the previous Government and the current strength is just under 13,400. My objective, despite the enormous financial issues facing the Government, is to ensure that Garda numbers will not fall below 13,000 and I will be bringing relevant proposals to Cabinet in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Operation Fiacla was set up by the Garda Commissioner and is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country.

In addition, the latest quarterly figures for burglary suggest that Operation Fiacla is having an impact, when compared with the quarterly figures prior to its introduction.  Indeed the most recent crime figures show that the number of aggravated burglaries is down when compared with the previous 12 months.

The Garda National Policing Plan for 2013, which I laid before the House last December, sets out the policing priorities and objectives for the current year.  The Plan is designed to meet the policing needs of all communities, in urban and rural areas, including active community engagement in the development of policing strategies and concerted efforts to support and protect vulnerable sections of the community.</p><p>  Under the Plan, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continues to vigorously tackle organised crime through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations, including through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist Garda units.  Notwithstanding the challenges faced in tackling organised crime, week in week out the Garda are successfully bringing people involved in this type of criminality before the courts and a substantial number are presently serving sentences in prison.</p><p>  Other examples of particular strategies adopted by the Gardai in recent times include  Operation Fiacla which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries.  The latest quarterly figures from the Central Statistics Office for burglary suggest that Operation Fiacla is having an impact, when compared with the quarterly figures prior to its introduction, and I am hopeful that the success of the operation will be continue to be reflected in future crime statistics as they become available.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b> I am informed that as of end February  2013, 4,226 persons have been arrested and 2,327 persons have been charged under Operation Fiacla, reflecting the extent of the operation and the impact it is having.  </p><p>  Garda&iacute; also continue to work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora including the Joint Policing Committees and through community based initiatives such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.  There are over 1,300 local Community Alert groups around the country. The signing, in January this year, of an updated Memorandum of Understanding between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Mu&iacute;ntir na T&iacute;re who administer the Community Alert programme further underlines the Garda commitment in this area.  Furthermore a new Garda Community Crime Prevention Programmes booklet has been published to support the establishment and operation of Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and similar local crime prevention initiatives. </p><p>  Another area of concern has been the incidence of metal theft and, building on their existing crime prevention operations and advice, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published a new Metal Theft Crime Prevention and Reduction Plan, on 6 February 2013. The Garda Plan was developed in close cooperation with stakeholders who participated in a metal theft forum and it is designed to provide for an effective and multi-agency response to the problem. The publication of the Garda Plan is an important first step in providing a strategic framework to tackle the rise of metal theft.</p><p>  More generally, local Garda Management closely monitors patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. The situation is kept under review and paramount consideration is given to the needs of residents in our communities. Garda Management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to communities and that current structures in place meet the requirements of the delivery of an effective and efficient policing service.</p></reply>

With regard to organised crime structures in this jurisdiction, I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently two categories of organised crime groups operating in the jurisdiction. The first category consists of groups that are well established and tightly structured and who are involved in offences such as drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups who are characterised by less cohesive group structures and whose criminal activities are mainly confined to Ireland. </p><p>  In the circumstances, and taking into account the disparate and constantly evolving nature of the groups involved, it is not possible to give a reliable figure for the number of gangs operating at a specific time.  The operation of these groups is monitored on an ongoing basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, where relevant, information is disseminated at a European level to Europol.  I can assure the Deputy that addressing organised crime remains a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This priority is clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013 which sets out the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities.</p></reply>

In that context, the legacy the last Fianna F&aacute;il-led government bequeathed to me was a series of expenditure ceilings for the Justice Sector which, if  applied, would have resulted in devastating cuts in Garda services which I, as Minister, would not and could not stand over.  The Fianna F&aacute;il National Recovery Plan was unacceptable and would certainly have put the Garda Commissioner in an impossible position. Fortunately, I was able to secure additional funding over the three year period, 2012-2014, to ensure that the Garda Commissioner, and indeed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, could continue to deliver an effective policing service.</p><p>  Ireland's agreements with the Troika do not include the closure of Garda stations. Over the last two years the Commissioner has carried out a complete review of the District and Station network and in his professional opinion, with which I fully agree, has set out details for the closure of 139 Garda stations throughout the country.  39 of these stations were closed in 2012.  8 of these had not been opened for a number of years.  Their closure was a paper exercise which simply recognised reality.  95 were closed on the 31st January 2013 and the remaining 5 will be closed in the coming months.</p><p>  While the Policing plans for 2014 and 2015 have not yet been prepared, I understand, from discussions with the Garda Commissioner, that the current consolidation process will be largely completed by the end of this year and it seems unlikely at this point in time that there will be any further station closures in 2014 and 2015.</p></reply>

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.

The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.</p><p>  Waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases.  The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times. It should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of Circuit Court sittings in venues outside Dublin. This increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President of the Circuit Court plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011. The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  Arrangements are underway to appoint a small new cadre of specialist judges of the Circuit Court to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. The President of the District Court is also concentrating judicial resources in the areas of greatest need and is currently considering the allocation of additional judicial resources to the hearing of Family Law cases to address delays in this area.</p><p>  The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous review and has introduced a number of initiatives such as reorganising sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses to reduce waiting times. In addition, the delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has increased judicial availability for trial work. These initiatives continue to be reviewed and expanded. While the waiting time for asylum pre-leave applications is high, the allocation of more judges and, particularly, more research support for judges has helped to reduce the waiting time for post-leave applications to its lowest level in over two years. The Courts Service has also advised that, despite significant pressure, the waiting times in the High Court lists have generally reduced considerably.</p><p>  The Supreme Court, however, continues to experience lengthy waiting times which are now in excess of four years.  Waiting times for priority cases are 9-12 months at present and the Chief Justice has directed that no new cases be admitted to the priority list unless it can be clearly demonstrated that it is an exceptional case where there are urgent grounds necessitating a priority hearing.  Such urgent grounds would include appeals directly affecting the custody of an individual, child abduction, urgent family law matters, and appeals with urgent and systemic constitutional implications. Although considerable efforts are being made to manage the waiting times, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the establishment of a Court of Appeal. I recently announced my intention to establish a Court of Appeal with both criminal and civil jurisdiction.  The Government is committed to the holding of a Constitutional referendum on Article 34 which is necessary to achieve this and work has commenced in my Department in this regard.  It is intended that the referendum will take place, together with at least one other referendum, in the autumn.</p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.</p><p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.</p></reply>

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced. The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority and Register of Charities, had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place in 2011.  Arising from this review, I delayed bringing this legislation into force as we considered how best to achieve the objectives of the Act in a context of Government spending reductions.  It remains an objective of the Government to strengthen the regulation of the sector in effective and proportionate ways.  To advance this, a public and stakeholder consultation is being conducted by my Department on the implementation of the Charities Act and the establishment of a register of charities.  Issues covered in the consultation paper include the establishment of a Charities Regulatory Authority; the statutory registration of charities and granting of charitable status; and reporting requirements for registered charities.

It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to make a final decision on the date of closure of Stepaside Garda Station and I have no function in that regard.  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of all law-abiding people who reside in this State.  The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties in Stepaside and other Garda Stations will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of all communities.  Nationally, revised policing arrangements will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013.</p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests.  Local Garda management have engaged and will continue to engage with communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements following the closure of any particular Garda station.  The objective is to ensure that the best possible policing service is provided to the public at all times.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Stepaside is in the Blackrock District in the Dublin Metropolitan Eastern Division.  Stepaside Garda Station is approximately 3 miles from Dundrum Garda Station.  As of 31 January 2013, there are 35 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Stepaside Garda Station.  The majority will be allocated to Dundrum Garda Station and some will be allocated to Blackrock Garda Station.  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of all law-abiding people who reside in this State.  The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties in Stepaside Garda Station will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of the community there.</p></reply>

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The current average processing time is approximately 8 to 10 weeks.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations are aware of the processing time frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection processes.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda vetting, the standard procedure is that all applications from no matter what organisation are processed in chronological order from their date of receipt.  It is my objective that processing times should be kept to a minimum, while maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system.  In that regard, following recent discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, sanction was recently granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Garda Central Vetting Unit in the near future.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Garda Central Vetting Unit will become the National Vetting Bureau under the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and will have a substantially expanded role under that legislation.  I am currently engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in addressing the staffing issues relevant to the coming into force of the 2012 Act.</p></reply>

Its business customers include business tenants, fishing vessel owners and crew, and full access is required for commercial traffic servicing the fishing side and its various ancillary enterprises.  A wide range of other users use the harbour, including commuters using the DART service, yacht club members, walkers, tourists and other social users.  This combination of uses of the Harbour brings its own inherent dangers and it is essential that the needs of all users are accommodated as far as possible in a safe and secure facility.  Health and Safety concerns must be paramount in the management of the Harbour. </p><p>  Traffic and parking management within the Harbour itself has been an issue for some time, particularly in the light of concerns raised about safety and emergency access for the Coastguard, the Lifeboat service, and an G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There have been a number of occasions where the volume of cars in the Harbour and the resultant pressure on parking has led to a situation where emergency access has been seriously compromised.  The Harbour authorities have received specific complaints from elements of the emergency services in that regard.  Fortunately no serious incident has arisen yet.  Enabling works and upgrading works have been taking place over a number of months in order to improve traffic management within the Harbour and a number of additional measures are being considered.  All aspects of health and safety within the Harbour are of course kept under constant review</p></reply>

State Aid approval was received from DG Comp in respect of the proposed tariffs on 18 October 2011.</p><p>  My Department was consistently supportive of the efforts to introduce these REFIT tariffs.  The tariffs apply to a broad range of Biomass Technologies, including Anaerobic Digestion Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and non-CHP, Biomass CHP and also Biomass Combustion.  The tariffs will be adjusted by way of indexation annually by the annual increase, if any, in the consumer price index in Ireland commencing 1 January 2010.  REFIT III has the potential to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 targets under the Renewable Energy Directive, particularly through the more highly efficient energy production process of CHP which makes use of the heat produced in energy generation instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that funding these REFIT tariffs results in an additional charge to electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation as provided for under the Electricity Regulation Act.  The REFIT for Biomass Technologies was subject to the normal Government approval process and was approved by Government in December 2011.

I have emphasised to the Health Service Executive the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.</p><p>  The HSE's National Service Plan 2013 states that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce. National Standards for reducing non-consultant hospital doctors hours have been issued to hospital managers and clinical directors. These specify a series of compliance targets and timescales and will be used to assess progress on a site by site basis,  The HSE has also recently established a national group chaired by a senior executive to bring a clear and urgent focus to implementation of the Directive, assessment of performance and site by site accountability for change. The hours of other healthcare workers are in compliance with the Directive.</p><p>  The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 provided for implementation of the 1993 Working Time Directive in respect of most workers, including healthcare workers. Non-Consultant hospital doctors however had been excluded from this Directive and consequently they were excluded from Part II of the Act, which provides for minimum rest periods, a  maximum working week of 48 hours averaged over a reference period, and other matters relating to working time.</p><p>  Directive 2003/88/EC consolidated  Directive 93/104/EC and Directive 2000/34/EC. The latter Directive had reversed the exclusion of non-consultant hospital doctors, and provided for a phased reduction of their maximum average weekly working hours, with full compliance to be achieved by August 2009. The European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004 transposed the EU Working Time Directive for non-consultant hospital doctors in Ireland. It provided for:</p><p> - the phased reduction in the average working week to 48 hours;</p><p> - 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work; and</p><p> - 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.</p><p>  The consolidating 2003 Directive recognises that certain activities may require continuity of service and allows for the provision of compensatory rest where this arises, subject to the workers concerned being afforded appropriate protection. It specifically identifies doctors in training as a relevant category. In 2010, the 2004 transposing Regulations were amended to specifically recognise collective agreements permitted under the Directive between the two sides of industry, such as that reached between the HSE and the IMO which provides for non-consultant hospital doctors working for 24 hours, subject to compensatory rest being granted.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy.</p><p>  In relation to financing of UHI, my Department is currently advancing work on the <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.</i>  This White Paper will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. The work involved is both complex and technical and demands a wide-range of specialised legal and financial expertise which my Department is currently in the process of engaging.  It also requires strong engagement across a number of Government Departments. To facilitate this, my officials are currently establishing a UHI Design Team which will include representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and elsewhere. The Team will oversee progress on the White Paper and ensure effective, timely collaboration across different Government areas as appropriate.</p></reply>

The maximum grant of &euro;5,020 was payable once in any three year period.  More than 300 people received the grant each year at an estimated cost of &euro;1.3 million.  The key eligibility criteria for the Motorised Transport Grant included medical criteria, the requirement of a car in order to retain employment and a means test to determine the amount of grant (if any) payable.  Eligibility for the Motorised Transport Grant could also be considered in Exceptional Circumstances, other than for employment retention, for a person with a severe disability who lived in very isolated circumstances and where their disability prevented use of public transport.</p><p>The Mobility Allowance was a means tested, HSE payment to persons with a severe disability, (who are unable to walk or be in such condition that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous to their health) who are over 16 years and under 66 years, to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings.  The Mobility Allowance is paid monthly and the current rate is &euro;208.50 per month.  ere are in excess of 4,700 recipients of mobility allowance at an annual cost of over &euro;9 million.</p><p>I have provided the Deputies with the figures for the numbers of applicants in receipt of the Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant for the last full year for which those figures are available, i.e. 2011, in the table below.</p><p>Conscious of the position of the Ombudsman that the Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant schemes are illegal in the context of the Equal Status Acts and following detailed consideration of the issues involved with Cabinet colleagues, the Government decided on 26th February that it was no longer possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they operated and to devise an alternate solution for meeting the priority transport needs of people with a disability.  Although the Government's decision ends both schemes to new applicants with immediate effect, the payment of Mobility Allowance to those currently in receipt of it, will continue for another four months.</p><p>The Government remains very conscious that there are many people who cannot access public transport and who rely on supports such as the Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant for their transport needs.  Unfortunately it is not possible to expand these schemes to comply with the Equality Status Acts, without incurring very significant additional costs, which would result in a requirement for severe service cut back in current disability, older people and mental health services.  It is important to note that the decision is in no way intended to save costs and the funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the priority transport needs of people with a disability.</p><p>A special review group, which will be independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  Following the initial phase of the group's work, which will concentrate on issues around Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant, a key concentration of the group will be to look at opportunities for the enhancement of the transport options provided to the relevant persons in need.  As part of the review, the HSE will examine the circumstances of all those currently benefiting from the schemes to ensure the identified solutions will encompass their priority mobility needs.  In addition, the Minister for Health has instructed the HSE to contact each individual in receipt of the payments to notify them of this decision.</p><p><table><tr><th>County / HSE Region</th><th><div>Applicants in receipt of Mobility Allowance in 2011</div></th><th><div>Applicants in receipt of Motorised Transport Grant in 2011</div></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin South</td><td><div>99</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South City</td><td><div>75</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East</td><td><div>68</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South West / Kildare West Wicklow</td><td><div>394</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin West</td><td><div>207</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td><div>152</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>114</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>102</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>110</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan / Monaghan</td><td><div>80</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North Central</td><td><div>185</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North West</td><td><div>299</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td><div>255</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carlow / Kilkenny</td><td><div>251</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td><div>109</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork North Lee</td><td><div>213</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork South Lee</td><td><div>171</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td><div>69</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>173</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South Riding</td><td><div>116</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>128</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>191</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td><div>113</div></td><td><div>83</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>367</div></td><td><div>39</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>160</div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mid West</td><td><div>371</div></td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td><div>45</div></td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo / Leitrim / West Cavan</td><td><div>85</div></td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTALS</td><td><div>4,702</div></td><td><div>278</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The reforms, which are intended to better equip the Task Forces to respond to the current pattern of substance misuse, also provide for the extension of their remit to include alcohol addiction.  A final version of the report is being prepared which will take account of discussions at the Drugs Advisory Group and responses received in relation to the proposed reforms.  It is also envisaged that the final report will take account of Government decisions in relation to addressing the alcohol issue.  As I have previously outlined to the House, I intend to bring forward further measures to improve management, oversight and control of funding allocated by Drugs Task Forces in due course.  I also plan to consult with the Drugs Task Forces on my proposals in relation to boundary changes in advance of deciding the optimum coverage arrangements.</p></reply>

The National Standards are intended to underpin the licensing system for healthcare providers and will be the basis for the monitoring and inspection regime.  At present a communication and awareness programme is being rolled out to hospitals by HIQA and the HSE.  The Standards ensure service providers protect patients from risk and from harm, inform patients of adverse events, acknowledge and support the key role of staff, promote good governance and make the best use of information and resources to deliver high quality and safe care within the resources available.  Standard 1.7 requires service providers to promote a culture of kindness, consideration and respect.  The Standard ensures that a service provider should recognise that at certain stages of a services user&rsquo;s care and treatment, some individuals (for example, those who may be approaching end of life) may be more vulnerable than others and the service provider should proactively identify the likely points where this may occur and provide mechanisms to support service users.  The Standards will form the basis for the future licensing of all healthcare facilities in Ireland.</p><p>  In support of the Programme for Government commitment to the introduction of a national licensing system, work is currently underway in the Department on legislative proposals relating to the development of a licensing framework for health facilities.  Such a framework will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers.  It is designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that healthcare providers do not operate below core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way.  Once finalised, Government approval to carry out a public consultation process will be sought. </p></reply>

This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination, in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.</p><p>  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.  My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination.

It has been in use in the west of Ireland since July 2012.  Under the protocol, if patients can be transported to a primary PCI centre providing 24/7 treatment of STEMIs within 90 minutes of diagnosis, then they are brought directly to that centre. The primary PCI centre in the west of Ireland is the cardiology centre in University Hospital Galway (UHG). This unit has 2 cardiac catheter laboratories and a dedicated team of interventional cardiologists, nursing, technical and radiography staff on call 24/7. Based on international best practice, a unit such as this will serve the population of the west of Ireland for management of STEMI.</p><p>  If transport to UHG within 90 minutes is not feasible, then STEMI patients are taken to the nearest emergency department equipped to stabilise patients, such as Mayo General or Portiuncula Hospitals, for thrombolysis (administration of clot-bursting drugs) to stabilise the situation. They are then transferred to UHG for assessment as to whether further immediate intervention is needed. This is accepted international best practice for management of STEMI patients, particularly in remote areas.  In addition to the national protocol, the Code STEMI Protocol, approved by the Medical Director of the HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) and through the HSE Clinical Care Programmes, outlines the actions required by hospital and NAS staff when a STEMI patient is to be transferred from a hospital to a PCI centre. </p><p>  Following the death of a patient who had self presented at Mayo General Hospital with a STEMI, a number of steps were taken.  The NAS reported the incident to the National Incident Management Team of the HSE at national and regional level for review. The NAS carried out an internal review and in parallel requested an independent review, which was conducted by the State Claims Agency. A review was also conducted between the NAS and Mayo General Hospital to ensure that the CODE STEMI protocol is followed for this type of incident. The clinical programme lead of the Acute Coronary Syndrome Programme, and the Director of the National Ambulance Service, have been made aware of the outcome of these reviews and actions highlighted by the reviews have been implemented. These include training of staff, additional auditing of calls within the Ambulance Control, a written protocol between Mayo General Hospital and the NAS and the recirculation by the NAS of the Code STEMI protocol.</p></reply>

Also, the HSE envisages that the forthcoming Clinical Guidelines for Opioid Substitution Treatment will address many of the issues that are raised by service users and their families.  The views of service users were sought and taken on board when a review of the methadone protocol which was carried out in 2010.  Work on the implementation of the recommendations of that report is now progressing.  Meanwhile, the Methadone Protocol Prescribing Implementation Committee and the National Drug Rehabilitation Implementation Committee include service user representation.</p></reply>

It was staffed by persons with the necessary clinical, IT, operational and management skills to address issues relating to both unscheduled and scheduled care, who were seconded to the Department from the HSE and some other organisations.  Administrative support for the SDU was provided by Department of Health staff.  Dr. Martin Connor of Value Based Health Solutions was contracted in June 2011 to provide a number of services, including the setting up and operationalisation of the SDU.  In order to maintain and build on the work achieved from June 2011, a Government Decision was made on 29 November 2011 to re-engage his services to provide expert advice to the Department and to the SDU.</p><p>  In order to deliver the required improvements in relation to emergency departments, elective, outpatient and diagnostic services, a need for directors of performance management in scheduled and unscheduled care was identified.  Whereas the post of Director of Performance Management in Scheduled Care was filled by open competition in December 2011, a similar competition for the post of Director of Performance Improvement in Unscheduled Care failed to secure a suitably qualified candidate.  The services of Ms. Lis Nixon of Lis Nixon Associates were secured by open tender in January 2012 to address this situation.  As the SDU transferred operations from the Department of Health to the HSE with effect from 1 January 2013, the Deputy's question, insofar as it relates to other SDU staff members, has been referred to the Executive for direct reply.</p></reply>

I have sought its inclusion in the updated Core Ten-T Network currently under discussion and have also proposed that it be designated part of a specific Core Corridor under the Regulations governing the next round of Ten-T funding for the period 2014 -2020.

My Department is working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the Heads of the new Bill to provide for the merger of the airport with a restructured Shannon Development in a new, commercial, State-owned entity and this legislation will be advanced during the first half of this year. When the Heads of the Bill are ready, they will be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport for their consideration prior to drafting. It is my hope, subject to enactment of the Bill, that the new Shannon entity could be established mid-year although I appreciate that this will be challenging. It will then be a matter for the new entity to proceed with the development and expansion of the aviation services centre in Shannon.</p><p>  In January, I appointed Rose Hynes as Chairman of the SAA and in that context I expect her to take on the role of Chairman designate for the NewCo which is in the process of being established.  More recently, I have made four further appointments to the board of the SAA, including two employee representatives nominated by ICTU.  A process to recruit a Chief Executive for the Shannon Airport Authority and the new Shannon entity (NewCo) is also currently under way.  In addition, my colleague, Minister Bruton and I, have written to the Chairmen of the SAA and Shannon Development requesting that they and their management teams work closely together over the coming months to ensure an orderly transition to the establishment of NewCo. In this regard also, Minister Bruton appointed Ms Hynes and one other SAA board member to the board of Shannon Development and it is likely that one further common appointment may be made to the boards of the SAA and Shannon Development to maximise synergies between the two ahead of the merger.</p></reply>

The purpose of the offer was to stimulate inbound tourist traffic. There have been some positive developments in relation to additional capacity on US-Ireland routes for 2013 linked to both general traffic demand and the expected increased traffic linked to the Gathering. However, overall the response from the airlines to date has been inadequate. The Government has made it clear that it will need to see a significant increase in capacity and routes before consideration can be given to abolishing the tax.</p><p>  The &euro;3 flat rate charge has applied since 1 March 2011. Data from the three State Airports shows a modest increase in passenger numbers of 0.5% in 2012 at the three airports.  Individually this breaks down as: </p><p>  - Dublin airport increase of 1.9% on 2011</p><p>  - Shannon decrease of 14.9% on 2011 and </p><p>  - Cork decrease of 0.9% on 2011.</p><p>  However, a number of factors influence demand for air services so it is not possible to attribute increases or decreases of this magnitude to any one factor.</p></reply>
