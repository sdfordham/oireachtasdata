    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-07a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700059#WRA00500"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of measures in place in relation to the association of driving licence details with penalty points.  The primary purpose of Section 63 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 is to ensure that the driver licence number of individual offenders is recorded, to enable the application of the appropriate penalty points to the licence on conviction by the Court.  The Courts Service notifies all penalty point convictions to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the points are assigned to the relevant driver record in all cases where driving licence details are supplied.  Where a driving licence number is not available penalty points are assigned through a process of matching with other available information, where this is possible.  In those cases where it is not possible to identify a driving licence, details of the conviction are nevertheless retained as penalty point records in relation to the individuals concerned.</p>  <p>  I am of course concerned that recent figures indicate that a large proportion of persons, having been brought before the Courts on penalty point offences, did not present their driver licences in Court and in many cases thereby avoided having penalty points recorded on their licences.</p>  <p>  It is an offence under the Road Traffic Act to fail to provide your licence details and, as I have recently advised the Deputy, an arrangement has been put in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to facilitate the bringing of prosecutions for the non-production of a driver licence in these circumstances.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will shortly commence prosecutions at multiple locations nationwide, targeting persons not presenting their licences in Court.</p>  <p>  I expect this will send a strong message that it is essential that our Road Traffic laws are respected and that there are consequences for the minority of persons who seek to evade them.  Ultimately enforcement and prosecution of offences in this area is about improving public safety and reducing deaths on our roads, and there must be no way out for anybody seeking to avoid receiving penalty points.</p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that my Department is in ongoing and intensive contact with the other relevant agencies with a view to ensuring that the most effective system to associate penalty points with driver licences is in place.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I have recently received an update from the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group on this matter and we have asked that further urgent consideration be given to this specific issue with a view to more detailed analysis being submitted later this year.  In addition to assessing the impact of the prosecutions referred to above, this analysis will consider other means of addressing this issue, including an examination of the feasibility and means of introducing a mandatory association between driver licence details and vehicle registrations.</p></reply>

The strategy will contain an action plan towards ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul Convention), elements of the implementation of the transposition of the EU Victims Directive into Irish law and practice, which relate to domestic and sexual violence and worthwhile actions from the first national strategy which are of an ongoing nature. Following completion of consultation with relevant stakeholders I will seek Government approval for the publication of the strategy which I expect to obtain in the near future.</p>  <p>  Included as part of the strategy will be the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill. I envisage the Bill will be published  this D&aacute;il session. The Bill will provide for new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.  It also includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation.  When enacted, the Bill will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of EU, UN and Council of Europe legal instruments as well as implementing the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas Committees.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the decision by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to cease funding the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, which took effect from the end of March this year. My officials have had contact with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this issue and I have met with the Rape Crisis Network Ireland. I am familiar with the issues involved, which are primarily a matter for Tusla and  the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  In 2014, my Department provided funding of just over &euro;300,000 to organisations working to combat sexual violence towards awareness-raising activities, court accompaniment and legal advisory services. However, Tusla - the Child and Family Agency - is the main public sector funder of the sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-07a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700059#WRA00900"><p>This is a complex matter and I would like to point out some of the issues which arise.  To that end, I assume what we are discussing is decriminalising those who offer their services as prostitutes and not the buyers, brothel keepers and pimps who would also fall under the category of 'those in prostitution'.</p>  <p>  Firstly, I would like to remind the House that the General Scheme to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, which I published last November, includes proposals in the area of prostitution.  There are two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.  As an additional means of combating the exploitation which is associated with prostitution, these offences specifically target the demand side of prostitution.</p>  <p>  The first provision is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence.</p>  <p>  These new offences address recommendations contained in two reports of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality - a report following a review of prostitution and a more recent report on domestic and sexual violence.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with targeting the demand side of prostitution through these new offences, it is also very important that support and assistance is provided to those who wish to exit prostitution.  My Department, through the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, provides funding to Ruhama for the support of persons affected by prostitution.  Funding of &euro;225,000 was provided to Ruhama this year.</p>  <p>  I am aware, however, that there are calls to further decriminalise the women and men who provide sexual services. The extent to which these women and men are currently subject to the criminal law is limited.  Under existing law, there is an offence of soliciting, in a public place, for the purpose of prostitution and an offence of loitering, in a public place, for the purpose of prostitution.  These offences apply to both a person who offers his or her services as a prostitute as well as to those who seek to obtain such services.  These offences are targeted at addressing the public nuisances associated with this type of activity.  Without understating the vulnerability of those involved in providing sexual services, there is also a public nuisance aspect to prostitution which must be addressed.  There must be a balance.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of the approach adopted in Northern Ireland where an offence of paying for sexual services of a person was recently introduced.  The existing offence of loitering or soliciting for purposes of prostitution by persons offering such services was also repealed.  Consequently, those who offer sexual services are no longer subject to any criminal offence under prostitution legislation.  I am not convinced that a similar approach must be adopted in this State.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am aware of the concerns expressed by the groups who work with the women and men in this area and I take those concerns seriously.  It is my intention to review possible alternatives which will recognise the exploitative nature of prostitution, continue to support women and men in exiting prostitution while ensuring any public nuisance concerns are addressed.  Any proposals will require consideration by Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-07a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700059#WRA01100"><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The objectives, functions and powers of GSOC are governed by the 2005 Act.  The Annual Report of GSOC for the year ending 31 December 2014 is the seventh full calendar year report of the Commission&rsquo;s operations.</p>  <p>  As documented in the Annual Report, 2014 was a busy year for GSOC in dealing with investigations. The Annual Report states that GSOC received 11% more complaints in 2014 over 2013 and concluded 8% more cases in 2014 compared with 2013.</p>  <p>  I know that questions have been raised in the past about the level of cooperation that GSOC receives from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but I am glad to say that the 2014 Annual report gives a generally positive message on that issue. The Report notes that there were marked improvements in efficiency and in dialogue and cooperation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am confident that this trend will continue into the future, reinforced by recently renewed co-operation protocols agreed between GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  It is vital that the public has strong confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the system of oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is a key part of our policing architecture tasked with a central role in maintaining public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As Deputies will be aware, this Government is, at present, implementing a comprehensive programme of reform in the areas of policing and justice.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act 2015 passed by the House earlier this year is an important piece of that reform. The Act, which is fully in force, strengthens and clarifies the remit and capacity of GSOC. The legislation has provided GSOC with more comprehensive and effective powers of investigation and oversight which enable it to fully discharge its functions.</p>  <p>  Resources and funding are also kept under continuing review to ensure that GSOC has all the necessary resources to continue to operate effectively and efficiently and in accordance with its statutory remit. This year, an increase of &euro;1 million in the GSOC allocation was provided to resource the organisation's activities. Arrangements have also been put in place for a staff recruitment campaign to fill current vacancies.</p>  <p>  Finally, I should say that the Government has recently agreed to nominate Judge Mary Ellen Ring to be appointed as Chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission following her nomination for appointment to the High Court.  I am confident that Ms Justice Ring will bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to the position of Chairperson and I look forward to working with her during her term of office.</p></reply>

There were 18 people in attendance including trainers.</p>  <p>  This training has been organised as part of the roll-out of RIA's policy in respect of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence and Harassment. The policy document itself is available on RIA's website at www.ria.gov.ie. The policy was produced by a working group comprising representatives from RIA, Cosc (the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence), AkiDwA (migrant women's network), Ruhama, Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Domestic Violence and Advocacy Service, the Irish Refugee Council and the UNHCR. The policy is being introduced to help provide advice and support to staff and residents where such a need arises at any accommodation centre.</p>  <p>  The Policy recognises that RIA and the centres under contract to it have a duty of care to all residents. This duty requires RIA to provide safe accommodation which promotes the well being of all of its residents. RIA will be implementing an integrated and coordinated response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence &amp;amp; harassment within our network of reception / accommodation centres and in cooperation with the network of support services around these centres.</p>  <p>  To date there have been training courses on 20-21 May and 10-11 June 2015 at Mosney accommodation centre, on 16-17 June in Old Convent accommodation centre in Ballyhaunis, Mayo,  and 2-3 June and 1-2 July at Knockalisheen.</p></reply>

The factual position is as follows.  A total of 1,481 new asylum applications were received to the end of June this year compared with 597 for the same period in 2014. This is a year on year increase of 884 applicants or 148%. The top five source countries for applications in 2015 are Pakistan, Bangladesh, Albania, Nigeria, and India. These countries account for some 70% of all applications received to end June. The sharpest increases relate to applications from Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals.</p>  <p>  The number of applications received already this year has exceeded the total number for all of last year.  This is obviously putting a significant strain on resources, particularly on the Direct Provision system which is now virtually full.</p>  <p>  The trend in relation to increased asylum application numbers is also being experienced across other EU States. I have, however, asked my officials to investigate the reasons giving rise to the sharp increase in applications from certain nationalities.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) asylum applicants may make an asylum application at the frontier of the State and are given permission to enter and remain in the country pending the final outcome of their application.</p>  <p>  I want to make it clear that Ireland always has and will continue to live up to its obligations in relation to the granting of protection to those who are in need of it and meet the criteria set down in international and national law.  However, where such applicants are deemed to be unfounded, then they must leave the State when required to do so.  This is the position with all developed nations worldwide and Ireland is no different in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-07a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700059#WRA01700"><p>I can assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the measures which are being taken to combat crime and enhance public safety in the city centre area. I am advised that Garda&iacute; make full use of the extensive range of legislation which is in place to address street crime and anti-social behaviour, including knife crime and drug related crime.   I am aware of course of the concerns which have been expressed in relation to a particularly serious recent incident of knife crime in the city centre, and note that persons have been charged in connection with these assaults.</p>  <p>  Tackling this type of crime is central to the overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate. As part of the Garda Plan a range of dedicated policing operations and measures are in place to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in the city centre.  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of the first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; are of course key components in providing visible policing in the city centre and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Garda responses, I am sure the Deputy would concur that the issues involved are not simply policing ones. He will also recall that I have previously met with the key state agencies and other stakeholders in relation to various actions which are aimed at improving the general environment in Dublin City Centre, and strongly support this ongoing work.</p>  <p>  In relation to the concerns which have been expressed about drug misuse in the city centre, the Deputy will be aware that  the Government's overall response to the problem of drug misuse, is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016. The Strategy is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and it  provides a coordinated and comprehensive response founded on a partnership approach.</p>  <p>  I think it is generally accepted that the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a  multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.   These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader aspects of the problems referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Finally,  I welcome the continued close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council and other agencies as well as ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, such as the Dublin City Business Forum.  My Department is maintaining contact with these cooperative initiatives, and I understand that positive feedback is being received in relation to the policing measures being employed by the Garda authorities, and their level of engagement  with business and community interests.</p></reply>

The Report, acknowledging government policy in this area, does not recommend any immediate right to work. It does, however, recommend that provision for access to the labour market for protection applicants, who are awaiting a first instance decision for nine months or more (in line with the recast Reception Directive) and who have cooperated with the protection process (under the relevant statutory provisions), should be included in the International Protection Bill and should be commenced when the single application procedure is operating efficiently.</p>  <p>  This recommendation takes account of the fact that, under the current statutory arrangements, first instance decisions in respect of refugee status and subsidiary protection do not, in the normal course, issue within nine months at present.</p>  <p>  A key concern with regard to granting protection applicants the right to work is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system could be undermined by giving persons who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum, the same access to employment as immigrants who follow the appropriate pre-entry route to obtain employment in the State. There is an effective immigration and visa system in place for those who wish to migrate to the State for employment purposes. Any change of policy in relation to access to the labour market by protection applicants would also need to have regard to the large number of people currently unemployed in the State.</p>  <p>  It should also be borne in mind that while access to the labour market is permitted in other Member States, it is often the case that this is very restricted with access to only certain labour market sectors and often only after specific periods of time have elapsed.  In addition, access may be subject to labour market tests having been met.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the Working Group and their implications will be carefully considered by Government in the coming period.</p></reply>

The standard certification fee is stipulated as &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  There is no provision to waive or reduce the applicable statutory fees. Each application for naturalisation is also subject to an application fee of &euro;175.</p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met. I do not accept that citizens of other EU states are less able to pay naturalisation fees than nationals of other countries. The Deputy may wish to note that there has been an substantial increase in the number of EU nationals applying for and being granted Irish citizenship over the past 3 years.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.  Democratic participation by citizens is a cornerstone of our representative democracy and a leaflet informing new citizens of their right to register and vote in all elections in the State and how to register is included in the ceremony packs issued to candidates for citizenship.</p>  <p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

Implementation of this programme, including the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate, is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach.</p><p>Following the publication of the Report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established an Implementation Steering Group to focus on the implementation of the short<font color="#2F2F2F">, </font>medium and long-term recommendations in the Report.  To assist in the overall reform process a Strategic Transformation Office has been established at Garda Headquarters to coordinate the implementation of the reforms arising from the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report.</p><p>Important steps to respond to Report's recommendations have included the establishment of Risk Compliance and Continuous Improvement Offices in each Region to ensure the standardisation of processes and to support Regional Garda management in improving the delivery of local policing services and ensuring governance and accountability.</p><p>Other important measures which are being taken forward are the development of a new accountability framework for crime investigation, incident management and administration, as well as the introduction of a new IT strategic planning process to oversee the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology. In this regard I have been working closely with my colleague Minister Howlin to secure the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology and I hope to make significant announcements shortly in relation to the development of Garda ICT systems.</p><p>The Garda commitment to improving the support to victims of crime is highlighted in early developments following on the Inspectorate's recommendations. These include the establishment of Garda Victim Service Offices in each Garda Division from March 2015.  In addition, a new Child Protection, Domestic Violence and Human Exploitation Unit has been established and a Chief Superintendent appointed to oversee the new unit under the auspices of Garda National Support Services.  Updates are also being made to PULSE to facilitate better communication with victims.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that following a detailed analysis of PULSE data in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, the CSO has recently resumed publication of the quarterly crime figures, along with an analysis of the how the issues identified by the Garda Inspectorate impact on the production of these statistics.  The analysis carried out by both the CSO and the Garda Inspectorate has identified common issues of concern in relation to Garda crime recording processes and systems.  Following the publication of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na took a number of important initiatives to address the issues identified in relation to the recording of crime, and the Commissioner has recently indicated that, arising from and building on this work, she expects a series of further new measures to be rolled out nationally later this year.  It is essential that we have access to accurate, reliable data on crime, and the CSO will continue to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address the issues identified, and has indicated that it will repeat its analysis of the data quality issues at regular intervals.</p><p>I might also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to other work being led by the CSO which is chairing an Expert Panel to examine the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations on crime statistics, including with a view to the development of new crime counting rules.</p><p>More broadly, my Department has established a Criminal Justice Strategic Committee, as part of the overall justice sector reform programme, and as also recommended by the Inspectorate. The Committee includes the heads of all the relevant criminal justice agencies and provides a forum to address cross-cutting issues within the criminal justice sector.</p></reply>

Nevertheless the State cannot be regarded as having an obligation to subsidise the family concerned and the sponsor must be seen to fulfil the responsibility to provide for his/her family members if they are to be permitted to come to Ireland".  </p>  <p>  This sets out the rationale for the policy very clearly.  While economic considerations are not the sole criteria to be considered and there is always scope to look at exceptional circumstances, it is reasonable for the State to expect a person seeking to be regarded as a sponsor for another person's immigration  to Ireland to demonstrate capacity to support them.  Age does not change that principle.   It should be noted also that this in no way prejudices the right of the person seeking to come to Ireland to apply in their own right through one of the various immigration channels open to them, for example as a student or employment permit holder.</p>  <p>  I should say that the policy position set out above is in line with the family reunification policies of immigration regimes across the EU and of other developed countries worldwide.</p></reply>

Preparations are currently being made to bring the Bill to the D&aacute;il for Report Stage, with a view to enactment later this year. The requirement to enact suitable capacity legislation has long been one of the core obstacles to ratification of the Convention and the progress made in this area is a testament to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the obligations of the CRPD in a comprehensive and meaningful way.  Progress is also being made on necessary reforms to legislation on sexual offences, and by my colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State for Primary and Social Care, on reforms to mental health legislation.  Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  Further measures required to enable ratification include amending unsuitable and outmoded language and in some cases, archaic legal provisions, in other legislation. </p>  <p>  Once all legislative measures have been agreed by the Interdepartmental Committee, we will submit a Memorandum for Government setting out the roadmap to ratification and requesting approval for legislation to amend current obstacles to ratification. Once approved by Government, we will publish the roadmap, outlining the measures to be taken to overcome all outstanding barriers to ratification of UN CRPD, along with the estimated timescales involved.</p></reply>

Section 42 of the Referendum Act 1994 provides that the validity of a provisional referendum certificate may only be questioned by a petition to the High Court, that a petition may not be presented unless the High Court has given leave to do so and that a person seeking leave must do so no later than seven days after the publication of the certificate in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  </p><p>Section 44 of the Referendum Act 1994 provides that a petition must be lodged in the Central Office of the High Court not later than three days after the grant of leave by the High Court under section 42.</p><p>Section 46(2)(a) of the Referendum Act 1994 provides that in fixing the date for and conducting the trial, the court shall give the matter such priority as is reasonably possible.  Policy in relation to the Referendum Acts is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are, under the constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presidents monitor waiting times across all court lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time.</p><p>Two separate parties sought leave to petition the result of the Marriage Referendum in the High Court. Those cases were heard on the 5th June by the President of the High Court, and leave was refused in each case.</p><p>Both applicants have since lodged appeals with the Court of Appeal and, pending the hearing of those appeals and subsequent order of the court, that Court has stayed the certification of the referendum result. The appeals are now scheduled to be heard on the 30th of July. It is my understanding that this is a priority appeal hearing.</p><p>Given that there is a stay on certification of the referendum result by the Returning Officer pending the hearing of those appeals in relation to the High Court's refusal of leave to petition the provisional referendum certificate, the Thirty Fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill cannot be signed into law at this point by the President in accordance with Article 46 of the Constitution. A Marriage Bill for the purposes of implementing the necessary legislative changes to give effect to the constitutional amendment set out in Thirty Fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill therefore cannot be published and introduced in the D&aacute;il at this time.  Depending on the outcome of the appeal process and the court's determination, I would expect, if appropriate, to bring a Marriage Bill to Government for approval and introduction into to this House as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

The position remains unchanged.</p>  <p> The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is constantly seeking ways in which the visa system may be developed to facilitate legitimate travel to the State for the purpose of tourism and business.  In doing so, officials in INIS maintain regular close contact with relevant Government Departments and agencies.  It is, however, important to emphasise , at the outset, that the vast majority of tourists visiting the State - over 96% - are from countries whose citizens do not require a visa to travel to the State e.g. the United Kingdom, other EU states, the United States, etc.</p>  <p>  In July, 2011, the Government launched the first ever Irish Short-Stay Visa Waiver Programme.  Under this Programme, tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa are able to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  The Programme covers eighteen countries including major emerging tourism and business markets such as China and India.  The Programme has proven extremely successful leading to a 68% increase in visits from the countries covered by it  from 2010 (the last full year before its introduction) and 2013.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of this programme, negotiations took place with the United Kingdom authorities on the development of a reciprocal programme i.e. of also allowing visitors with an Irish visa to travel to the UK on the basis of that visa.  These negotiations led to the establishment of the British Irish Visa Scheme which I launched, with the UK Home Secretary, in October last year.  This Scheme was implemented in China later that month and in India in February of this year.  The Scheme, which will supersede the Waiver Programme, allows visitors to travel to and around the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, including the north and south of the island of Ireland, on a single visa.  A formal joint review of the Scheme with the UK is due to be carried out shortly and both Governments have committed to the worldwide roll-out of the Scheme to be substantially completed by the end of this year.  I am confident that this Scheme will build on and expand the growth in visitor numbers resulting from the original Waiver Programme.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, a liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other regular visitors with a good visa history, has been implemented in the Irish Visa Offices in Beijing, Moscow, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi over the last few years.  This regime allows for the issue of multi-entry visas for up to five years' duration for applicants with a good previous visa history.</p>  <p>I am satisfied that the existing visa regime continues to support and facilitate tourism growth from countries whose citizens are visa-required for travel to the State.</p></reply>

Testing of the system is currently underway. It is expected to be in place shortly.  I should emphasise that applications for re-entry visas may be made by post. There is no necessity to attend at the public office and I would urge all applicants to make full use of the postal service insofar as possible.</p>  <p>  In common with the re-entry system, the immigration service is also planning to introduce an on-line booking system for appointments to register and apply for permission to be in the State. Naturally, it is important that there is coherence between the various services provided to persons using the public office whether they are provided by INIS or GNIB. Therefore, the experience of operating the re-entry visa appointment system will be examined to see if it can be adapted for the registration and permission to remain process also.</p>  <p>  I should point out that within existing arrangements every effort is made to provide a customer friendly service for callers to the Burgh Quay offices.  The GNIB Public Office is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays).  The office also remains open through lunchtime.  Priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work or conduct business, with tickets for persons registering their presence in Ireland for study-related purposes being allocated after 9am (special arrangements are in place for students during the period September &ndash; Mid November to cover the return to studies period).  This is to minimise the amount of time persons at work are required to be away from their jobs.  In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.

As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to detail the operational measures that the Garda authorities have taken or would take generally in relation to threats and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, I can assure the Deputy that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities are of course taken.   More generally, tackling serious and organised crime and addressing the harms it gives rise to at all levels in our community is a central policing priority, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has my full support for the strategies it has in place to give effect to this commitment.   I should also say that while the criminal law in this area is being kept under ongoing review, there is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against Garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

In general terms, while the Directive permits certain restrictions on legal services advertising that are informed by the public interest, the Commission has found that some of the current restrictions being applied in this jurisdiction under existing law may be disproportionate. A letter of Formal Notice to that effect issued to the Government in October 2014. The issue of there being a possible infringement by Ireland is, therefore, being resolved under current Government policy as a matter of legislative reform rather than by direct correspondence with the legal professional bodies. Such correspondence does not, therefore, arise in this instance. The Government's vehicle for this reform is the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.</p>  <p>  My Department is therefore engaged, under the normal procedures, in ongoing correspondence and consultations with the European Commission with a view to finding the appropriate balance between the exigencies of the Services Directive and those of Government policy. Such advertising refinements as may be agreed between the Government and the Commission in achieving that balance will be put forward by way of appropriate amendment to the Legal Services Regulation Bill.</p>  <p>  By way of further explanation of the approach being taken, the Deputy will wish to note the key change that is already taking place under the Bill in relation to the advertising of legal services by legal practitioners. While, at the moment, the legal professional bodies regulate advertising by their members, under section 158 of the Bill it is the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority that will be responsible for the making of regulations in this area. Moreover, this will be the case in relation to both solicitors and barristers.  The resolution of a possible infringement of the Services Directive is, therefore, being approached by means of the drafting of appropriate adjustments to the existing advertising reforms of section 158 of the Bill that can meet the relevant policy concerns.</p>  <p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill is now before the Seanad having completed Seanad Second Stage on 13   May. It is anticipated, therefore, that any Government amendments being proposed to ensure advertising compliance with the Services Directive will be among those circulated for consideration for Seanad Committee Stage which I expect to take place in the Autumn. The intention is that the Bill be completed so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority can come into operation without delay this year.</p></reply>

In order to enable it to carry out its functions effectively GSOC has been given extensive powers, similar to those which the Garda&iacute; have, under the 2005 Act. These include powers relating to, for example, entry and search of any place pursuant to a warrant, arrest with or without a warrant, search of a person, detention and questioning, taking fingerprints, issuing a summons and the bringing of a charge against a person.</p>  <p>  All allegations of criminal offences by Garda&iacute; are investigated by GSOC's own investigators for which they have these full police powers.  GSOC may refer other complaints to the Garda Commissioner for investigation under the Garda disciplinary code, and it may maintain oversight of progress in those investigations. GSOC has the authority to make recommendations to the Garda Commissioner concerning disciplinary proceedings, and also to send a file to the DPP where it feels that the conduct under investigation may constitute an offence.</p>  <p>  There is a mechanism in the 2005 Act for the independent investigation of a criminal investigation by GSOC.  As the Deputy will know, following the recent tragic death of a serving Garda in Donegal who was the subject of a GSOC investigation, I requested the Chief Justice, in accordance with section 109 of the  2005 Act, to invite a judge to undertake an inquiry into the conduct of that investigation.  Mr Justice Frank Clarke, Judge of the Supreme Court, was subsequently appointed to conduct this inquiry.</p></reply>

This is a major undertaking for the Central Statistics Office and requires detailed forward planning in order for census enumerators to call at every home in Ireland to deliver in the region of 1.8 million census forms. </p><p>The CSO works hard to ensure that the information collected and provided from the census remains current, relevant and of maximum use to the public. It has been common practice in advance of each census to conduct a public consultation on possible new questions and changes to existing questions, which are then considered by a specially convened Census Advisory Group in advance of testing in the field in the form of a pilot survey of some 12,000 dwellings. Unfortunately given the very tight budget circumstances in 2013 and 2014, with constraints on resources right across the public sector, it was not possible to pursue this route for census 2016. Accordingly the 2016 census is being run as a &lsquo;no-change&rsquo; census with the questions on the 2016 questionnaire remaining unchanged from those used in the 2011 census, with the exception of the question on marital status.  </p><p>The format of the question on disability used in 2011, and being repeated in 2016, was agreed by the Census Advisory Group which was established to assist the CSO in developing the 2011 questionnaire. This group comprised representatives of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data, along with the relevant CSO personnel.  The group reviewed over 90 submissions for new questions or changes to existing questions during the course of their work. In addition a specific sub-group, comprised of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the  Equality Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies was convened to consider the disability-related questions on the census form. The current format of the disability question was tested successfully in the April 2009 Census Pilot Survey and the Government  subsequently accepted the advice of the CSO and the Census Advisory Group to accept this format of the question. </p><p>The exact format of the question is outlined below, and persons can choose multiple categories of disabilities. As censuses of population are traditionally held at five-yearly intervals in Ireland it is intended that should there be a census in 2021 a full public consultation on the questions to be asked will be conducted in advance.</p><p>Q. 16.

In the circumstances, it is not possible for the State to take over responsibility for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where those companies are reliant on State funding.  This position was confirmed by the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform to this Department in March 2015.  </p>  <p>  The provision of State funding for a CE pension scheme would result in potential claims from employees of other companies in the community sector. The State cannot afford this level of exposure to funding pension arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's position is that private companies contracted by the State to provide a service, including those in the community sector, must manage their expenditure pressures, including labour and pension costs, from within existing funding levels.</p>  <p>  Employers (including CE Sponsoring Organisations) are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002. All CE Sponsoring Organisations were apprised of their responsibilities under this Act at that time. </p>  <p>  CE Supervisors may also qualify for the State Pension at 66 years of age. If they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions (520 contributions @ full rate, equivalent to 10 years contributions) they will qualify for the State Pension (Contributory), which is not means-tested. In the event that there are insufficient contributions, the person will qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), provided they satisfy the means test.</p></reply>

His means for this claim were based on his assessed income during 2013.  He appealed the means assessment of his farm income and an oral hearing was held on 11th March 2015.  At the hearing, he indicated that he was particularly concerned that his expenditure for the lease of his farm had not been allowed for in the assessment.  As he had not previously raised this expenditure with the Department in the course of the means assessment process, the Appeals Officer asked him to provide evidence of payments made during 2013 in respect of the farm lease.  This evidence was outstanding on the date that the Appeals Officer, who had been assigned the case, retired. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the file has been assigned to another Appeals Officer.  I understand that although the person concerned has, in the meantime, provided a copy of a lease agreement dated 18 March 2014, no evidence has been provided to date to show that payments in respect of the lease were actually made in either 2013 or 2014.  I understand that the appeals office will be writing to the person concerned shortly requesting that he provide evidence of any payments actually made in respect of the lease in order that the Appeals Officer can consider if these can be taken into account. </p>  <p>  In the meantime the person concerned is quite entitled to request a review of his current farm assist payment, which at this stage would be based on a means test of his income in 2014. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

Ultimately it is the responsibility of the trustees of a pension scheme to ensure compliance with the funding standard obligations of the Pensions Act.</p><p>The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013, which came into operation from 26th December 2013, amended the Pensions Act 1990 to change the manner in which the assets of a defined benefit pension scheme are distributed in the event of the wind up of a pension scheme.  It also broadened the options available to trustees in any consideration of a restructure of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act.  The amendment essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members and beneficiaries.  The issue of how these changes might be applied is a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries.</p><p>Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Authority.  This guidance makes provision for the notification of all scheme members in advance of any proposed restructuring of scheme benefits.  In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Authority must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before a restructuring of scheme benefits can take place.</p></reply>

Earlier this year, I introduced regulations and approved an amendment to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority to provide for the recognition by the trustees of a pensions scheme of groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred members of pension schemes. These changes mean that all groups representing the interests of the various categories of pension schemes membership are treated the same in the context of the provisions in the Pensions Act.  These changes will facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members and the Pension Authority and the trustees of a pension scheme. </p><p>I understand that my officials have previously met with representatives of the association referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aim of the programme is to provide this cohort of young people with a work placement experience, where they gain the opportunity to learn and develop basic work and social skills in organisations in the private, public, voluntary and community sectors, that will help bring them closer to the labour market.</p>  <p>  These are people who even at the peak of the Celtic tiger would have had difficulty securing employment. Employers are being asked to sponsor work experience opportunities for these young people, to give them a chance over an extended period and to stick with them, even if in the initial weeks the experience is less than good. The Department will also be working to support the participants. It will source pre-employment training and will assign a dedicated case officer to work with them for the duration of the internship. </p>  <p>  Given the commitment that is being asked of employers and being offered by the Department, it is not unfair to ask that young people selected for the programme will offer a similar commitment.  The Department will not be taking a heavy-handed approach, but failure to commit to a suitable opportunity must be considered in the context of the obligation on all persons in receipt of a jobseeker payment to demonstrate that they are making serious efforts to find work.</p>  <p>  The scheme was formally launched in February 2015, and to date a total of 73 companies have signed up to First Steps offering 122 internship positions.  There are currently 26 individuals on the scheme.</p>  <p>  An econometric evaluation of the JobBridge Scheme will be undertaken by independent external consultants.  The Request for Tender is due to issue later this month and we expect to have the contract awarded by early September.  Preliminary findings from the evaluation should be available later in the year.</p>  <p>  As of 25 June, a total of 40,993 individuals started a JobBridge internship since the scheme commenced, of which, 11,346 were under 25 years of age.</p>  <p>  As at 25 June, there were a total of 5,258 individuals on a JobBridge internship, of which, 1,369 were under 25 years of age.</p></reply>

Case officers generally work in teams dedicated to activating clients and supporting them in various ways in their efforts to regain employment.  The team-based approach helps to maximise efficiency and effectiveness and to ensure that a streamlined service is provided to jobseeker clients.   </p>  <p>  The total number of staff dedicated to providing activation and case management support services is currently 500 (Whole-Time Equivalents), not including clerical support. This number is subject to change over time as staff retire, are re-assigned, are promoted etc. and is kept under review.  In addition, there are 42 case officer vacancies at present.</p>  <p>  In common with all Government Departments, this Department must operate within an Employment Control Framework target, set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and within this, activation and control functions are prioritised as resources allow.  </p>  <p>  The Local Employment Service, which the Department contracts annually, supplements its own employment service provision and provides vocational guidance, employment supports and mediation to jobseekers and others.  In the region of 160 mediators are currently employed by 21 Local Development Companies and 1 Community Group as part of the contractual arrangements in place with the Department.</p></reply>

The underspend arises as a result of a lower requirement (&euro;189.64 m) for an Exchequer Subvention to the Social Insurance Fund, higher (&euro;7.91 m) than profiled Appropriations in Aid with both offset by higher than profiled expenditure (&euro;50m) on Vote 37 schemes, services and administration.

While expenditure on the schemes, services operated by the Social Insurance Fund (and associated administration costs) was just below target, similar expenditure on Vote 37 was just short of &euro;50 million ahead of profile.

County councillors may, however, establish entitlement to social insurance benefits based on their non-council related activities.

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2015, representing approx. 34.4% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year resulting in the Department having to make provision for an additional &euro;168 million this year.

I signed the Occupational Pensions Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) (Amendments) Regulations, 2015 and approved Pensions Authority guidance to facilitate this change. </p>  <p>  The change to regulations require the Pensions Authority to notify groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members in situations where the Pensions Authority is proposing to issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B.  This requirement will afford the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the Pensions Authority in relation to such proposals.  The Regulations also give the representative group the right to appeal such a direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law. </p>  <p>  I also approved an amendment to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority on this matter. This change to guidance will require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members of proposals by the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme to issue a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits.  This requirement will afford the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of a pension scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits. </p>  <p>  The issue of engagement with the industrial relations machinery of the State falls within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is acknowledged that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations.  However, I would expect that any group that is recognised for the purposes of collective representation with the trustees of a pension scheme could seek to engage voluntarily with the enterprise involved in talks or trade dispute with its employees.</p>  <p>  You might note that pension schemes in Ireland are generally set up under trust and, in that context the trustees of a pension scheme are required to act in the best interest of all scheme members.  I have no current plans to bring forward amendments to the Pensions Act at this time and will continue to monitor the application of the act on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-07a.273.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700063#WRE02800"><p>The final phase of the one-parent family payment scheme reforms took place on 2 July, 2015, when the maximum child age threshold for the scheme was reduced to 7 years for all recipients.  On that day, the Department supported all affected customers to transition to an alternative income support payment, including the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA), and the family income supplement (FIS).</p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports to assist them to move towards sustainable employment. </p>  <p>  FIS is the most financially advantageous option that is available to affected lone parents and on the basis of advice from Intreo staff the Department has processed up to 1,600 new FIS applications to date from the affected customers.  These customers increased their hours of employment to 19 hours per week, or 38 hours per fortnight and can now also claim the back to work family dividend (BTWFD) where they can retain the child increase portion of their payment.  This is worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year with 100% entitlement and &euro;775 in the second year per child as entitlement reduces 50%.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that to reach the threshold hours for FIS an individual can work for one employer or can combine hours from a number of employers.  </p>  <p>  The majority of customers who transitioned out of the one-parent family payment scheme on 2 July, 2015, moved to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, which is available to lone parents who have a youngest child aged 7 to 13 years inclusive and who qualify for a jobseekers allowance payment.  These customers are exempt from the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance conditions that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  As such, no lone parent with a youngest child aged under 14 years is required to take up employment in order to receive income support from the Department.  They can also move into education and/or employment, including into part-time employment (for example, during the mornings, when their children are at school), if they so wish, and still receive payment, subject to a means test.  </p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment recipients are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and, more significantly, can avail of a wide range of employment support programmes, including the community employment scheme, JobBridge, the back-to-work enterprise allowance, the rural social scheme, and JobsPlus.  These customers can also avail of a wide range of educational options.  They can apply for both the SUSI maintenance and tuition grants and, if eligible, their maintenance grant will not be assessed as means for the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  They can also participate in a wide range of SOLAS and education and training board courses.    </p>  <p>  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Former one-parent family payment recipients who have a youngest child aged 14 years or over who are either not working or working under 19 hours per week, transitioned to a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment &ndash; with the full conditionality of that scheme applied.  These customers receive the same level of activation supports as all other jobseekers.</p>  <p>  For any affected customers who are currently working less than 19 hours per week and are having difficulty increasing their hours to qualify for the FIS and BTWFD payments, the Department will work with these customers and employers to assist them to find additional employment.</p></reply>

However, as a member of the euro area, each Member State has obligations, and this is no different for Greece.  </p>  <p>The second economic adjustment programme for Greece expired on 30 June and all associated financing attached has also expired.  Any agreement at this stage would likely be in the form of a new programme with associated conditionality.  It is in everyone's interest that an agreement is reached.</p>  <p>  Following the result of Sunday's referendum in Greece, I hope that the Greek Government will continue discussions with fellow Member States in an effort to provide certainty for the Greek people and return stability to their economy.  Ireland will continue to engage in an effort to reach a successful conclusion to any negotiations.</p>  <p>  I will attend the Eurogroup (euro area Finance Ministers) today, where we will take stock of developments and listen to the new Greek Finance Minister.

Having said that, my officials have contingency plans in place for a number of eventualities, including the possibility of Greece leaving the euro area.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-07a.322.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700064#WRF01700"><p>The term 'transfer pricing' describes the process by which members of a group of companies set the prices at which they pass goods, services, finance and assets between each other.  There has been a substantial worldwide increase in trade in recent decades, much of which now takes place within multinational groups.  Transfer pricing is a normal and necessary feature of transactions within large groups of companies.</p>  <p>  Ireland introduced transfer pricing legislation in the Finance Act 2010.  The legislation provides the statutory basis to challenge an understatement of profits for tax purposes as a result of abusive transfer pricing and there is an increasing focus by the Revenue Commissioners, as for tax authorities in other countries, on ensuring that multinational profits are not understated.  Ireland's transfer pricing legislation is to be interpreted in accordance with the internationally recognised OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have adopted a phased approach to the implementation of this legislation.  The initial phase focused on requesting companies to undertake comprehensive Transfer Pricing Compliance Reviews.  In 2015, Revenue has commenced risk-based audits specifically examining companies' transfer pricing arrangements.  While the implementation of this legislation is still in a relatively early stage and Revenue will monitor whether any changes to the legislation may be necessary to address issues that may be identified, there is no concern that Revenue has insufficient powers.</p>  <p>  At an international level, Revenue is closely involved in the G20/OECD BEPS Action Plan project.  In particular, the outcomes of actions 8, 9, 10 are likely to result in significant changes to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.  Actions 8, 9 and 10 seek to better align profits with the activities that create value with the objective of ensuring that profits are taxed in the jurisdiction in which they arise.  Revenue also actively participates in the EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum ("JTPF"), which assists the European Commission on transfer pricing tax matters.  One of the issues currently being considered by the JTPF is the implementation of Country by Country Reporting (CbCR) at a European level.  Ireland supports the implementation of CbCR and Revenue recognises that it will be a useful tool for transfer pricing risk assessment.</p>  <p>  On foot of a commitment contained in the Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness which was published as part of Budget 2015, Revenue has also been allocated additional resources for its Competent Authority team dealing with transfer pricing issues.  The Revenue officers concerned engage with treaty-partner country tax administrations where a company resident in that treaty-partner country considers that excessive transfer pricing adjustments are being sought in relation to transactions involving an associated company resident in Ireland.  The Competent Authority team is also responsible for the negotiation of bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements ("APAs") which are a form of cooperative compliance by companies that serve to reduce the risk of abusive transfer pricing.</p></reply>

Where the opportunity has arisen, for example in Rwanda a number of years ago, Revenue has shared its expertise in assisting tax administrations to modernise, particularly in relation to the automation of processes making use of information technology. </p>  <p>  I am informed that Irish Aid, in collaboration with the Revenue Commissioners, is at an advanced stage of preparation of support to be provided to the Malawian Revenue Authority under the Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB) Initiative.  This initiative, run by the OECD Tax and Development Programme, aims at building capacity through targeted, hands-on tax audit assistance programmes where foreign tax auditors work with local tax auditors in developing countries on actual tax audit cases, directly transferring audit knowledge, techniques and skills through a 'learning-by-doing' approach.</p>  <p>  Since 2013, a particular focus of Ireland's tax treaty negotiation work, which is principally undertaken by Revenue, has been to engage with African countries that wish to extend their treaty network.  A tax treaty was negotiated with Botswana in 2013 and with Ethiopia in 2014; treaty negotiations with Ghana, which began in 2014 are nearing conclusion.  In addition, Ireland's treaty with Zambia, signed in 1971, was renegotiated in 2014 and the replacement treaty was signed in March of this year.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Ireland's approach to negotiations is respectful of the need for treaties to be mutually beneficial for both countries concerned in avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion.  The effective operation of a treaty requires each country to be satisfied that the treaty meets its objectives. Tax treaties involve the sharing of taxing rights.  Ireland considers that agreeing to specific source taxation, for example in relation to dividend, interest or royalty payments, in line with the treaty policy of those developing countries that follow the UN approach to such issues, ensures a practical and effective sharing of taxing rights.</p>  <p>  Tax treaties are reviewed primarily on the basis of the age of the existing treaty.  Where a country has sought to re-negotiate an old treaty, Revenue has agreed to the request regardless of the stage of development of the country concerned. Renegotiated treaties with two developing countries were signed in 2015.  A replacement treaty with Zambia was signed in March 2015 and a replacement treaty with Pakistan was signed in April 2015.  The original treaties date from 1971 and 1973 respectively.  The renegotiations of these treaties, and indeed all renegotiations, are informed by the same principles of mutual benefit, and satisfaction with the treaty, based on effective sharing of taxing rights, that govern the approach to new treaties.</p>  <p>  On a broader, multilateral, front, Ireland's support for Country by Country Reporting by multinational companies should result in the provision of this information to tax authorities in developing countries from 2017, which will be very useful in risk assessment in relation to multinationals' activity in those countries.</p></reply>

In relation to CRS reporting, I have committed Ireland to being one of the "early adopter" countries that will commence the automatic exchange of financial account information in September 2017.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also been supportive of Country by Country Reporting and my Department has signalled that support in my Department's 2013 International Tax Strategy document. More recently, we have taken an active role in the development of an internationally coordinated approach to CbCR as part of our commitment to the OECD/G20 BEPS project.  In supporting the agreed approach that has been set out in detail on foot of the BEPS project work, we are conscious that successful implementation will require the coordinated participation of a wide range of countries.</p>  <p>  The proposed rules on CbCR will require multinational corporations (MNC's), with consolidated annual group revenue of &euro;750 million or more, to file the CbC report annually in the country in which the parent entity of the MNC is resident.  The information required is the amount of revenue, profit before tax, tax paid and accrued for each tax jurisdiction in which the MNC does business.  It also requires MNC's to report their total employment, capital, retained earnings and tangible assets in each tax jurisdiction.  Finally, it requires MNC's to identify each entity within the group doing business in a particular tax jurisdiction and to provide an indication of the business activities each entity engages in.</p></reply>

Patent royalty income received by a company in the course of carrying on a trade is chargeable to corporation tax at 12.5% (and at 25% if it is received in a non-trading context). </p>  <p>  However, in Budget 2015, I introduced a new Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness which set out a comprehensive package of measures designed to reposition Ireland to reap the benefits of sustainable foreign direct investment in a changing international tax landscape. </p>  <p>  One of the measures announced in the Road Map was a new Knowledge Development Box ('KDB'), which will provide a reduced effective rate of charge on patent royalty income to the extent that it has been created by research and development carried out in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I view the Knowledge Development Box as a positive measure for Ireland.  It is recognised internationally that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by knowledge-based investment, which is related to research and development and intellectual property.  Putting in place an attractive tax offering for developing and commercially exploiting intellectual property is therefore important to encourage companies to develop their knowledge-based capital in Ireland, and for our continued success in attracting foreign direct investment into Ireland.</p>  <p>  A public consultation to gather views on how the KDB should operate was launched on 14th January and closed on the 8th April.  The consultation paper invited submissions from interested parties on their views of how the KDB should be designed to ensure that it meets the key objective of being the most competitive in class, within the agreed international parameters for fair tax competition in this area.  This consultation went well with active engagement from stakeholders my officials met with a number of parties throughout this time and nearly 40 written submissions were received.</p>  <p>  At the same time, Irish officials have continued to engage with the OECD on the internationally agreed parameters that will confirm what acceptable tax competition for this area, and what may be viewed as an acceptable KDB regime.  These discussions have been on-going at the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices and a consensus on the topic is expected very shortly.</p>  <p>  All of the above will feed into the overall design of the KDB which is being finalised over this summer and will be legislated for in Finance Bill 2015.</p></reply>

The concept of domicile is based on case law and is not prescribed in legislation.</p><p>An individual who is resident and domiciled in Ireland is taxable on their worldwide income and gains.  An individual who is resident but not domiciled in Ireland is only taxable on their Irish source income and any foreign income which they remit into the State.  The domicile levy, provided for in part 18C TCA 1997, is charged on an Irish domiciled individual whose world-wide income in a relevant tax year exceeds &euro;1m, whose Irish property is greater in value than &euro;5m and whose liability to Irish income tax in a relevant tax year is less than &euro;200,000.</p><p>Residence</p><p>Section 819 TCA 1997 provides that an individual is resident for tax purposes if he or she spends</p><p>- 183 days or more in the State in a tax year; or </p><p>- 280 days or more in the State between the current tax year and the previous tax year, with a minimum of 30 days in each year.</p><p>A day for residence purposes is one on which an individual is in the State at any time during a day.  </p><p>Ordinary residence</p><p>Section 820 TCA 1997 deals with ordinary residence.  Ordinary residence relates to residence that has a degree of continuity.  For instance, an individual could be non resident for a year but would remain ordinarily resident if the absence from the State was of a temporary nature.  Ordinary residence arises as a result of an individual being resident in the State for three consecutive years of residence.  Ordinary residence ceases after three consecutive years of non-residence.</p><p>Domicile</p><p>Domicile is a concept of general law.  Domicile is acquired on birth and generally linked to the domicile of the father and not the place of birth.  An individual can only have one country of domicile.  It is difficult to change domicile.  If an individual seeks to change domicile, he or she must prove that he or she now resides in a different country with the intention of remaining there permanently.</p><p>Revenue gathers statistics, from tax returns, on citizens who are resident but not ordinarily resident, individuals who are resident but not domiciled, and individuals who are non-resident.  It is important to note that the circumstances of individuals who are non-resident for tax purposes but who file tax returns can vary widely.  They include, for example,</p><p>- Irish nationals who have moved abroad for work reasons but who retain their home here (their tax return is generally only in respect of rental income on their Irish home);</p><p>- foreign nationals who never resided here but who have investments (including property)  here;</p><p>- foreign nationals who worked here for a period and who may have acquired Irish tax residence for that period (for example, individuals who worked here on a temporary assignment) may retain an Irish tax liability, after ceasing to be resident, in respect of investments made in Ireland during their period of residence.</p><p>The following information in relation to the numbers of individuals falling into each category in the years 2010 to 2013 might be helpful to the Deputy.  More extensive historical information is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of Revenue records.<table><tr><th></th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013*</th></tr><tr><td>Resident citizen but not ordinarily resident </td><td>1,127</td><td>685</td><td>651</td><td>693</td></tr><tr><td>Resident but not domiciled</td><td>4,015</td><td>4,093</td><td>4,310</td><td>4,757</td></tr><tr><td>Non- resident </td><td>9,759</td><td>12,555</td><td>14,999</td><td>17,409</td></tr></table><b>*</b>figures are provisional</p></reply>

There is no provision in the tax code for tax relief in this regard.  This is the case regardless of whether the payments are made voluntarily or under a legally binding maintenance arrangement.</p>  <p>  Maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse.  The effect of this is that the payments are treated in the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after-tax income.  This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.</p>  <p>  As regards maintenance payments in respect of a spouse, the position is generally that the spouse who makes payments under a legally enforceable maintenance agreement is entitled to claim a tax deduction in respect of the payments.  The maintenance payments are then taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse and the couple are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried.</p></reply>

The restriction was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget in respect of all residential lettings as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the year 2013, the latest year for which relevant information is available, and making certain assumptions about the data available to Revenue, it is estimated that the cost from increasing the level at which individuals can claim interest repayments against tax for residential rental properties from 75% to 100% could be in the order of &euro;80 million.  This is based on the assumption that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figures provided could be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost. </p>  <p>  As with all proposals to change reliefs relating to property, there are a number of considerations which must be taken into account to correctly target the measure and ensure this success.

It seems from the details provided that the Deputy is of the view that a reduction applied to a pension in payment from a pension scheme, on foot of a decision by the trustees of the scheme to pass on the impact of the pension fund levy, is ignored in determining the pensioner s taxable pension income.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that any reduction to the pension in payment of an individual, in these circumstances, is applied to the gross pension before tax or USC so that, in effect, it is only the amount of the gross pension after the application of any reduction, on foot of the passing on of the levy, that would be liable for tax. It is not clear, therefore, how the proposed tax exemption proposed by the Deputy would work in those circumstances.</p>  <p>  In my response to the Deputy's question of 23 June last on this general issue, I gave a very detailed and reasoned outline of my position in this matter.  For the reasons set out in that reply I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy or other levies.  I also made the point that taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees etc) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the tax burden on those on low and middle incomes.</p></reply>

The programme is supported by a combination of student fees, State funding and other income.  </p><p>While in this case the fees could be considered high, in the majority of cases where third level tuition fees are payable they are at much lower levels.  In addition, those participating in the programme must already have acquired an undergraduate degree, the fees for which would have been covered by the State in the vast majority of cases. </p><p>I would point out that tax relief at the standard rate of 20% is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, including a postgraduate course.</p><p>Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &quot;student contribution&quot;.  No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees.  A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.</p><p>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2015, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).  Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750.  Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375.  Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif">Tuition fees </font></th><th><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif">&euro;15,000</font></th></tr><tr><td><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif">Capped at </font></td><td><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif">&euro;7,000</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif">Less</font></td><td><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif">&euro;2,750</font></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><font face="MS Reference Sans Serif">&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850 </font></td></tr></table>I have no plans to introduce tax relief for loans taken out to pursue the graduate entry medical programme as tax relief is already provided for the tuition fees.  In addition, the introduction of such a relief would inevitably lead to calls for all other student loans to be similarly tax relieved.</p></reply>

Given the scale of the State's investment - some &euro;20.8 billion - and the different financial instruments this money is invested in, there are a range of options available to recoup value from the bank and it is critical that we get these decisions right.  As a result Goldman Sachs International and William Fry are assisting the Department with this work by providing financial and legal advice respectively.  </p>  <p>  Reconfiguring the bank's capital structure, which is not longer fit for purpose given the new regulatory regime, is just the start of the process, but it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.  Discussions commenced recently with the SSM (Single Supervisory Mechanism) and the Central Bank, AIB's regulators, regarding AIB's capital structure and this process is expected to take a number of months.  </p>  <p>  No decision has been made by the Government to sell any of our investments in AIB.  All options remain on the table and while I have said previously that an Initial Public Offering or IPO on the stock market, looks like the most likely exit route for the State, it is too early to specify what steps will be taken or to put a timeline on decisions.  Any sale will involve selling shares held by the ISIF.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated on numerous occasions, Government policy is that we will not remain a holder of our banking investments in the long term.  Given our high debt to GDP ratio, we do not have the luxury of holding all of these investments indefinitely and I envisage receipts from the gradual sale of these investments helping to play their part in reducing the State's overall debt burden in the coming years.</p></reply>

The key objective of these regulations is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to reduce the risk of bank credit and house price spirals from developing in the future.  Within the overall framework, the Bank has allowed for a certain flexibility by lenders to exceed these limitations when assessing individual cases.  However, in line with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code and other regulations, lenders will still be required to assess an individual borrower's affordability and lend prudently on a case by case basis.   Lenders will be required to submit data on their residential mortgage lending to the Bank on two reporting dates: (a) at 30 June each year to reflect activity in the 6 month period ending on that date and (b) annually at 31 December to reflect activity in the 12 month period ending on that date.  </p>  <p>  A preliminary aggregate level data submission must be submitted to the Bank within 10 working days of the reporting date.  Within 20 working days of a reporting date, a completed monitoring template including loan level data must be submitted to the Bank together with a final reconciling aggregate-level data set.  The first reporting date will be 30 June 2015 and this will be for the period from the date the Regulations came into effect until 30 June 2015. </p>  <p>  Regarding the level of mortgage activity, data from Banking and Payments Federation Ireland indicates that, on average, around 2,340 mortgages per month were approved in the first five months of 2015 and this compares to the monthly average of around 1,810 for the same period in 2014.</p></reply>

The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, will also end after this year.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  </p>  <p>  The pension fund stamp duty levies are charged on the trustees of pension schemes and others (including insurance companies) who have responsibility for the management of the assets of pension schemes or plans.  It is up to the trustees of pension schemes, for example, to decide whether and how the impact of the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent.  I have no detailed information on the decisions made by pension fund trustees or others in relation to the passing on of the full or a partial impact of the levy to the current, deferred or former (retired) members of pension schemes.  I am aware, however, that where trustees have made the decision to pass on the impact or part of the impact of the levy to pensioners that a smaller reduction in pension payments over the lifetime of the pension may have been made in many cases in preference to a larger reduction over a shorter period.</p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy collected as requested in the details supplied with the questions.  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees etc) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the tax burden on those on low and middle incomes.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Health has primary responsibility for the implementation of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has suggested that a social responsibility levy be introduced solely on the manufacturers of alcohol products.  I understand that the policy objective of such a levy would be to impose a levy on the drinks industry commensurate with the damage to society caused by the abusive consumption of the products that industry produces.  I believe that applying such a levy to drinks manufacturers alone would not achieve that objective, as the availability of cheap and below cost alcohol is not solely a matter for the manufacturers, but for certain retailers of alcohol products.  In addition, any consideration of the introduction of such a levy would need to examine wider issues such as its impact on Ireland's export trade.  In 2014, exports of alcohol products amounted to nearly &euro;938 million. </p>  <p>  All proposed changes to tax policy are considered in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

The exact suite of tests applied depends on the whether a petrol or diesel sample is to be tested and could include any of the following tests: specific gravity; distillation characteristics; simulated distillation profiles; methanol; ethanol; oxygenates; olefins and aromatics; lead; manganese; sulphur; RON and MON.  Tests may also be carried out to check for the presence of a range of different fuel markers. </p>  <p>  The types of instruments used in the tests include density meters, automated distillation units, UV-Vis spectrophotometers, gas chromatogaphs, gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer detector, high performance liquid chromatographs, X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer and a wide range of other commonly available laboratory equipment.</p>  <p>  The accuracy and precision (repeatability) characteristics of test methods depend on the sample preparation and analysis technique used, the matrix being tested and the level of analyte present.  These parameters have been determined via validation studies for all test methods used by the State Laboratory for routine testing of petrol and diesel samples. </p>  <p>  However because contamination of petrol and diesel can occur in many different ways, analyses carried out to test for contamination may also involve some non-routine testing, and accuracy and precision values determined during validation may not be fully applicable.</p>  <p>  The State Laboratory has Service Level Agreements in place with all its client Departments and Offices and operates on the basis of agreed turn around times for results to be reported.  In the case of Revenue Prosecution samples in the hydrocarbon oils area, the agreement is that 80% of samples will be reported within 50 days.  However, achieving this target will depend on the types of samples submitted and the testing required, and on the numbers of samples being within expected levels.  Also, at the request of Revenue, testing of priority samples takes precedence, which could have a negative impact on the turn around times for less urgent samples.</p></reply>

Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the Maltese Financial Services Authority on 30th April 2014 when a liquidator was appointed under the provisions of the Maltese Companies Acts 1995.  The liquidation is proceeding according to Maltese law. </p>  <p>  The liquidation of an insurance company is a legally complex and time consuming process.  The Liquidator has advised that settlements and refunds of premiums can only be paid out by the Liquidator after all of the Company's liabilities are quantified.  Since it could some time for a particular case to be finalised and, under the Statute of Limitations, claimants are given two years following an accident to make an initial claim, it may take some years before the liquidation process is completed. </p>  <p>  In the immediate aftermath of the announcement of the liquidation of Setanta, my officials were informed by Insurance Ireland that the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland had indicated that they intended to accept all third party claims.  My statements in the D&aacute;il reflected this position which was accurate based on the information available at the time.  </p>  <p>  However, the MIBI obtained a legal opinion and, having considered it, they advised the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in late July 2014 that the 2009 Agreement with him does not require the MIBI to satisfy awards against drivers covered by a policy of insurance where the insurer is unable to pay all or part of an award because of insolvency.  Jointly with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I obtained legal advice on this matter from the Attorney General.  Having considered the Attorney General's advices, I proceeded on the basis that the MIBI would not be playing a role in compensating claimants due awards under Setanta policies and that all Setanta claims, including those which were settled but not paid out by Setanta, would fall to be processed as part of the Setanta liquidation.  The Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the Setanta Liquidator have done much work to agree procedures to allow for advance payments of up to 65% in respect of claims to be paid from the Insurance Compensation Fund.  </p>  <p>  This updated position was provided by me in response to Parliamentary Questions regarding Setanta Insurance and the MIBI on 17th September 2015. </p>  <p>  The respective roles of the Insurance Compensation Fund and the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland in the compensation of former Setanta policyholders is currently before the High Court.  The matter will be heard by Mr Justice Hedigan on 13 July 2015.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Central Bank will in due course be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened.  However, since Setanta is a Maltese authorised company subject to prudential supervision by the Malta Financial Services Authority, any follow-up investigation on the regulatory issues surrounding the firm's failure falls under the responsibility of the MFSA as home regulator.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the Group threshold below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p>  <p>  There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p>  <p>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p>  <p>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p>  <p>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, applies in all other cases.</p>  <p>  Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.  In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts.  In addition, taxes on certain capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.</p>  <p>  I am aware that property values have increased, with developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises.  I recognise that the increase in property values has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds.  In this light I will, as the Deputy acknowledges in the details supplied, be keeping Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds, rates and other aspects of the tax under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill.  I am not in a position nor would I intend to say at this point what specific changes I may or may not propose but I will bear in mind the Deputy's concerns in my consideration of these issues.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions on sales transactions are a matter for the NAMA Board in the context of its statutory independent commercial mandate.</p>  <p>  In light of the political sensitivities in Northern Ireland to NAMA's exposure to Northern Ireland, the potential sale of such a large portfolio and the impact it may have on the Northern Ireland economy, I had a number of meetings with members of the Northern Ireland Executive where discussions of NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio and a potential sales process were discussed.  I can confirm the following meetings between myself, my officials, and members of the Northern Ireland Executive where NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio and its potential sale were discussed:</p>  <p>  13/06/2013 - Meeting in Dublin with Minister of Finance and Personnel </p>  <p>  04/09/2013 - Meeting in Dublin with Minister of Finance and Personnel</p>  <p>  27/09/13 - Meeting in Stormont with First Minister &amp; Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>  <p>  14/01/14 - Phone call with First Minister &amp;amp; Deputy First Minister.</p>  <p>  28/03/14 - Phone call with First Minister.</p>  <p>  I also regularly attended the biannual North-South Ministerial Council meetings between members of the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, where finance matters with cross border implications were regularly on the agenda and at which I briefed attendees on NAMA's general progress.  It was not unusual to discuss high-level matters relating to NAMA's Northern Ireland Portfolio at these meetings.</p>  <p>  In respect of the bearing these meetings had on the ultimate sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio, I have set out further detail below.</p>  <p>  Following a meeting on 13 June 2013 with the Minister of Finance and Personnel of Northern Ireland regarding banking issues with cross border implications, I received a letter for the Minister of Finance and Personnel which included a letter he had received from the law firm Brown Rudnick regarding potential investor interest in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  In my response to the Minister, I advised him that such an expression of interest should be made directly to NAMA and that any decision to entertain such interest would be a decision for NAMA.  I also indicated that NAMA's policy is to conduct openly marketed and competitive sales processes.</p>  <p>  I am advised that following a subsequent expression of interest to NAMA, NAMA appointed Lazard, a major international investment bank, to assess the market interest in a potential sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio and to subsequently advise on and oversee the sales process.  Lazard invited eight major global investment groups, alongside PIMCO, to participate in a competitive sales process (Project Eagle).</p>  <p>  I am further advised that on 10 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that its compliance staff had discovered that PIMCO's proposed fee arrangement with Brown Rudnick included a proposed payment of fees to Tughans, the legal firm who acted as a subcontractor for Brown Rudnick and a proposed payment of fees to a former external member of NAMA's Northern Ireland Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NAMA viewed this disclosure as a very serious development and the NAMA Board met on 11 March 2014 to consider the most appropriate course of action.  The NAMA Board decided that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit them to remain in the sales process.  On 12 March 2014, NAMA indicated its serious concerns to PIMCO regarding the proposed fee arrangement and, in particular, the proposed fee payment to the former member of the NIAC.  On 13 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that it would withdraw from the Project Eagle sales process.  For the avoidance of doubt, no fee payment was made by NAMA to PIMCO or to any of the parties involved.  I was informed of these developments by NAMA, including the withdrawal of PIMCO from the process.  </p>  <p>  NAMA and Lazard continued to engage with the remaining bidders and I am informed that Cerberus emerged as the highest bidder for the loan portfolio.  In light of the matter disclosed to it by PIMCO in March 2014, before confirming Cerberus as its preferred bidder, I am advised that NAMA, sought and received confirmation from Cerberus that no fee was payable to any person connected with NAMA in relation to any aspect of Project Eagle.  The proposed sale to Cerberus was announced in April 2014 and completed on 20 June 2014.</p>  <p>  NAMA has also recently made statements regarding the sales process which outline that NAMA takes all measures it considers appropriate to safeguard the integrity of all of its sales processes. NAMA's statement reiterates that confirmation was sought from Cerberus that no fee was payable to any person connected with NAMA, in advance of the conclusion of the sales process.  The Deputy will also note that Cerberus has stated publicly that in providing that confirmation to NAMA it sought and received the same confirmation from its legal advisor Brown Rudnik and, through Brown Rudnik, from the Northern Ireland law firm Tughans.</p>  <p>  I am fully satisfied that the best return to the taxpayer was achieved at that time and that the Agency acted conscientiously in exercising its commercial discretion.</p>  <p>  I understand that the very serious allegations made recently in the D&aacute;il refer to the actions of a former partner of Tughans.  Tughans, in their released statement, confirmed "that a former partner diverted to an account of which he was the sole beneficiary, professional fees due to the firm without the knowledge of the partners".  Tughans also confirmed that the individual in question no longer works for the firm and that they have "reported the circumstances of the departure of the former partner to the Law Society".  Therefore questions regarding the specific allegations are a matter for Tughans, the NI Law Society, and potentially law enforcement authorities in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I understand that Cerberus, in their statement, have emphasised that "no improper or illegal fees were paid by [Cerberus] or on [Cerberus'] behalf and [they] take any allegation to the contrary extremely seriously."  </p>  <p>  I wish to stress that the recent allegations, made by Deputy Wallace, in the D&aacute;il regarding the alleged misappropriation of funds within Tughans law firm are not in any way applicable to NAMA.  The swift remedial action taken by NAMA when an issue of concern did arise with one of the bidders, verifies NAMA's commitment to safeguarding the integrity of its sales processes.</p>  <p>  I would add that both NAMA and the Government will cooperate fully with any criminal investigation, should such cooperation be needed.  Similarly, I understand that NAMA will appear before the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee, on Thursday 9 July 2015.  The NAMA Chairman and CEO have stated that they welcome the opportunity to put on the record the factual position in relation to the sale of the loan portfolio of Northern Ireland debtors and to address any issues, of which NAMA has knowledge, which may be raised by the Committee.</p></reply>

The sale of NAMA Northern Ireland loan portfolio was conducted on an open market competitive basis and all bidders were given equal access to the same information.

The background to the NAMA Supreme Court appeal is as follows: A request was made to NAMA for access to certain information under the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007.  NAMA refused the request on the ground that it did not consider itself to be a "public authority" within the meaning of the Regulations.  The applicant appealed NAMA's decision to the OCEI.  The Commissioner found that NAMA was a public authority for the purposes of the Regulations.  NAMA appealed the Commissioner's decision to the High Court.  The High Court dismissed NAMA's appeal.  NAMA subsequently appealed that judgment to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 23 June 2015, dismissing the appeal.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations is his sole prerogative and I, as Minister, have no role in decisions in this regard. </p>  <p>  The position under the Valuation Acts regarding claims for exemption on charitable grounds is that in order for a property occupied by an organisation to be exempt from rates under the terms of Schedule 4 - paragraph 16 of the Act, that organisation must be a charitable organisation that uses the land, buildings or part thereof exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit. </p>  <p>  However, where a property which is occupied by a registered charity is used for retail purposes, it is considered that such a property is not being used exclusively for charitable purposes. Therefore, a charitable organisation in occupation of and using a property for retail purposes is rateable under the Valuation Acts. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Valuation Office that in relation to these specific cases there is no extant application to the Valuation Office for an exemption from commercial rates.</p>  <p>  In general, if an occupier of property is dissatisfied with a decision not to exempt a property under Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, there are extensive appeal avenues provided for in the Valuation Acts. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations in relation to a proposed valuation to the Revision Manager in the Valuation Office. Following consideration of the representations and determination of the valuation, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, an independent body set up for such purposes and, finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

A report on the potential of social enterprises to create jobs and to identify the actions required by Government and other relevant bodies and agencies, was commissioned and produced by Forf&aacute;s in July 2013. The Forf&aacute;s report recommended the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) to develop and champion the sector. The group was established in October 2013 and at that time Minister of State Sean Sherlock, who had a personal interest in driving this agenda, was appointed as Chair of the IDG, with administrative support to be provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Minister Sherlock has since been appointed as Minister of State to the Department of Foreign Affairs. While the work in this area continues political responsibility has not yet been reassigned.</p>  <p>  The Social Enterprise spectrum ranges from enterprises that are fully supported by the State through to a small number of commercially trading companies. Where Social Enterprises are trading commercially, they are fully entitled to engage with the range of enterprise supports provided by my Department and its agencies &ndash; particularly the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).  </p>  <p>  Where social enterprises are already supported by the State to provide certain services, they are not trading commercially and therefore not eligible for the finite supports the State has to offer to companies in the commercial sphere. </p>  <p>  My Department has no policy responsibility for the broader social enterprise sector and to this end I have no role or specific plan in relation to this area. However, there are many supports available to all entrepreneurs wishing to start up a business, and those that wish to expand businesses, with a viable commercial element.</p></reply>

The regime of control includes approval of new designs of measuring equipment, verification of instruments upon installation and following repair or recalibration and inspection over the life of the instruments.  Verification is a process that includes tests to determine that a measuring instrument conforms to its approved design and measures correctly within legal tolerances.  Upon successful conclusion of the tests, the instrument is secured with tamper-evident devices to prevent unauthorised access to its calibration settings. </p>  <p>  Owners/Operators of taximeters used for trade should ensure re-verification is carried out following repair or adjustment of parts requiring official seals to be broken. Knowingly failing or neglecting to ensure compliance may result in prosecution.</p>  <p>  In May 2014, Applus Car Testing Services (Applus+) was authorised under Section 12 of the Metrology Act, 1996 to conduct verifications of taximeters at a new reduced test fee. The cost per verification of a taximeter was reduced from &euro;75 to &euro;70 per test. Currently over 90% of taxi owners/operators pass the test. </p>  <p>  The Legal Metrology Service continues to work closely with the industry by providing technical information to support a reduction of taximeters that fail the verification test.</p>  <p>  In an effort to reduce the potential for failing the verification test Applus+ sends a checklist of requirements to each applicant prior to their appointment in order to draw attention to the items that should be taken care of before undergoing testing.  </p>  <p>  The current arrangements for failures agreed with Applus+ require either a retest with full equipment or in certain circumstances a visual recheck will be sufficient. Taximeters that fail the verification test due to a peripheral device issue, i.e. a printer, will be sealed at the time of verification and will require a visual retest within a set time to ensure that the issue has been resolved. This type of visual retest is carried out free of charge. </p>  <p>  Taximeters that fail and as a result cannot be sealed on completion of the test will require a retest after the issues causing the fail are resolved. Retesting of previously failed meters incurs a full test fee as a complete test cycle using equipment is required.</p></reply>

The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the Irish approval authority for this and related Directives.  The processing time reflects the technical nature of the approvals process, the increased registration of new vehicles at the start of the year and at the mid-year registration cycle and, in that context, the requirement on industry to build in an adequate provision for the automotive approvals timescale.</p><p>NSAI recognises that the current lead times are the cause of concerns for the industry and has implemented actions to continue to reduce the processing time.  In response to the increasing workload, NSAI went to tender for the provision of technical assessors, who commenced in January 2015. However, it was not possible to rapidly increase processing capacity as the sourcing and induction of engineers takes a period of approximately 6 months before they become competent in the approvals process. However, the effect of these new personnel is now beginning to impact on the processing times. </p><p>The timelines are also dependent on submission of complete and accurate information accompanying the application. It may be prudent, therefore, for companies to build in a contingency timescale to allow for clarifications and/or the provision of additional information. </p><p>In recent weeks, NSAI has also introduced a new IT system to help manage applications and workloads.  The new system allows tracking of applications through all stages of the application phase to final completion of approval. The new IT system will, however, be only populated by fully completed application forms - incomplete forms are returned to applicants &ndash; thus allowing more completed forms to be processed. </p><p>In addition, NSAI is carrying out training of appointed test centres (ATC&rsquo;s) in order that they can work closely with applicants to clarify the test and inspection requirements which are leading to delays in processing approvals. ATC&rsquo;s are commercial centres appointed by NSAI - and agreed with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority - to physically examine and issue test reports for some or all of the technical requirements. These test reports are then used by NSAI to grant approvals.</p><p>It is anticipated that these two new initiatives will contribute to an increased throughput of applications.</p><p>The NSAI will continue to closely monitor processing times with a view to returning to an optimum lead time target of two weeks.</p><p>The following table provides data on the number of IVA certification applications received, the number of applications completed and the average time taken to process applications, from January to June 2015.<table><tr><th>Total IVA Applications</th><th>Received</th><th>Completed</th><th>Average processing time (weeks)</th></tr><tr><td>Jan '15</td><td>589</td><td>370</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Feb '15</td><td>509</td><td>424</td><td>1.61</td></tr><tr><td>Mar '15</td><td>605</td><td>594</td><td>2.30</td></tr><tr><td>Apr '15</td><td>529</td><td>558</td><td>2.12</td></tr><tr><td>May '15</td><td>505</td><td>474</td><td>2.94</td></tr><tr><td>Jun '15</td><td>404</td><td>423</td><td>3.04</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3141</td><td>2843</td><td>2.21</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Ireland's labour market is part of a much greater EEA labour market which affords a considerable supply of skilled workers. Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought to hire a non-EEA national.  The Employment Permit (Amendment) Act 2014 provides the flexibility to deal with changing labour market, work patterns and economic development needs which often require rapid response. The Regulations, as provided for in the Act, are being reviewed and adapted on a biannual basis to reflect the exigencies of a changing enterprise environment.  They, inter alia, stipulate two types of occupation for the purposes of the employment permits system: the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations Lists (HSEOL) sets out the lists of eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and are in significant shortage of supply in our labour market.  This list is an integral part of the <i>Critical Skills Employment Permit</i>which is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.  The Ineligible Categories of Employment List includes those occupations for which there is a clear surplus of adequately skilled Irish and EEA nationals in the wider labour force.  </p><p>My Department has devised a process of reviewing and updating the HSEOL and Ineligible Categories of Employment List for employment permits bi-annually.  This review is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process.  Such a process involves obtaining and considering advice from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SMLRU - SOLAS).  It also involves input from relevant Government Departments, Agencies, and industry as necessary.  </p><p>The EGFSN&rsquo;s <i>Annual Skills Bulletin</i>contributes principally to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing monitoring of the labour market.

In some cases, where inspectors encounter minor or sometimes inadvertent breaches, the employer is asked to rectify them and where the matter is rectified to the satisfaction of the inspector, the matter is closed.</p><p>There are times, however, where it is necessary and appropriate to invoke legal sanctions against non-compliant employers who refuse to comply or have been found repeatedly to be in breach of the law.  However, such cases only amount to approximately 1.5% of all employment rights cases completed.</p><p>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 is designed to protect the health of young workers and to ensure that work during the school years does not put a young person&rsquo;s education at risk. The provisions of the Act encompass arrangements that are differentiated by reference to the age of young persons concerned, their school going status and whether school holidays are in effect.</p><p>It is an increasing reality that many young people are taking on jobs, both part time and full time during holiday periods. While many enjoy a positive experience there is a risk that others may be exploited. It is important, therefore, that young people are aware of their rights and the steps they can take when those rights are breached.  Prospective employers and employees are encouraged to make themselves aware of their respective obligations and rights under the Act.  Comprehensive information is available from the Workplace Relations Customer services (WRCS) at .  The service is provided through a contact centre in relation to employment, equality and in relation to industrial relations rights and obligations.  The service can also be contacted on lo-call <i>1890 80 80 9</i>.</p></reply>

This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  A study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5% and increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.</p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) includes in the scope (paragraphs 22 and 23), investment protection and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).  The stated aim of negotiations on investment is to negotiate investment liberalisation and protection provisions on the basis of the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date.</p><p>The mandate makes it clear that the inclusion of investment protection and ISDS will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement.  Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of EU and the member states to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner.</p><p>This means that the type of investment arbitration system under TTIP will be a vast improvement on investment protection in existing Bilateral Investment Treaties, some of which date back to the 1950s.</p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s Concept Paper, &ldquo;<i>Investment in TTIP and beyond &ndash; the path for reform</i>&rdquo;, published on 6 May, sets out the context for this reform and, building on the important progress that has been achieved in the investment agreements with Canada and Singapore, sets out four areas for further improvement: Governments&rsquo; right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an ISDS system, and an appellate mechanism.</p><p>These improvements are aimed at fixing the problems with investor dispute settlement in order to create a new modern system of investment arbitration.  Ireland already provides the highest protection for investors by virtue of Article 43 of our Constitution, so the policy intention of the Commission in these negotiations is not new to Ireland.</p><p>The inclusion of an acceptable model of ISDS would provide a common floor across the 28 Member States and at federal and state level in the US.</p></reply>

The attached tabular statement (A) sets out, on a county by county basis, the number of site visits paid in each of these years. </p><p>IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to specific locations in Ireland are only part of the long and complicated process involved in attracting foreign direct investment to this country.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, IDA Ireland does not comment publicly on the success rate of such site visits.  We must also remember that it is the investor in all cases who decides where to invest and an investment win for Ireland regardless of the location has to be seen as a plus for the country as a whole.  It is also worth noting that approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from the existing client base.</p><p>The attached tabular statement (B) sets out, on a county by county basis, the total numbers employed in IDA Ireland client companies in each of the years from 2010 to 2014, inclusive.  Figures for 2015 will not be available until early next year.</p><p>Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.  Additionally, a &euro;150 million property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation&rsquo;s regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s Business and Technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations.</p><p>In February, the Government announced details of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs: Regional</i>initiative which seeks to capitalise on the strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation.  The initiative will build on the success of the National Action Plan for Jobs, and encourage regional stakeholders - including enterprise agencies, Local Authorities, higher education institutions, other public bodies and the private sector - to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their own region. </p><p>In total, eight regional Action Plans will be developed and published this year. The first of these plans for the Midlands region covering counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath was launched on Monday 29th June. This plan sets out over 120 actions aimed to deliver enhanced employment growth in the region over the coming years with a target of increasing employment in the region by 10-15 % by 2020.  IDA has been tasked with attracting 25-30 additional FDI investment projects into the region over the next 5 years while Enterprise Ireland is to increase the number of start-ups by 25% by increasing their flow of start-up companies through enterprise hubs and onto Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s competitive programmes. The overall ambition of the Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Midland Region is to increase employment by approximately 14,000 by 2020.</p><p><b>Number of IDA Ireland sponsored Site Visits by potential

Independent legal advice should be sought if an individual has concerns about a specific employment situation.</p>  <p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) provides general information on employment, equality &amp;amp; industrial relations legislation, through the Workplace Relations Customer Service and Information Unit.  It can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or via its website www.workplacerelations.ie.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to delays &ldquo;in the courts&rdquo;.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the administration of the courts system falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Ms. Frances Fitzgerald, T.D.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to people &ldquo;unfairly dismissed&rdquo; from their job.  An avenue of redress in this regard, depending on the circumstances, may be the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 for which I have responsibility.  Claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts are currently heard, in the first instance, by a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), with an appeal being possible to the EAT in cases where the first instance hearing was before a Rights Commissioner, or to the Circuit Court where the claim was heard in the first instance by the EAT.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that there have in the past been significant backlogs in respect of both Rights Commissioner and EAT hearings.  I took the view that these delays were unacceptable, and this is one of the reasons I undertook a root and branch reform of Workplace Relations Services and Structures.  </p>  <p>  There have been significant reductions in backlogs.  In terms of Rights Commissioners, an offer of a first hearing for a referral under the Unfair Dismissal Acts to the Rights Commissioners Service is generally made in the region of 5-6 weeks outside of Dublin, and 9-10 weeks in Dublin.  This waiting time is inclusive of the statutory 21 day &ldquo;holding&rdquo; period provided for in the legislation, during which time a party to the hearing may object to the case being heard by a Rights Commissioner.  The current backlog in respect of EAT hearings stands at 60 weeks, which marks a significant reduction from a waiting time of 76 weeks in 2011.</p>  <p>  When the relevant sections of the 2015 Act are commenced, it will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure.  The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court will be merged into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).   The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.   When the relevant sections of the 2015 Act are commenced, and the Workplace Relations Commission established, all complaints, including those under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, will fall to be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission in the first instance, and, on appeal, to the Labour Court.   </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the relevant sections of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 will be commenced by Ministerial Order by 1st October.</p></reply>

IDA understands that discussions between the company and a private investment entity are ongoing at present.  </p><p>The agency has informed me that they are prepared to work with the new owner at the appropriate time and may be in a position to offer  an appropriate financial package of grants based on a viable and sustainable business plan, as they did for J&amp;amp;J when they operated the facility, to assist in delivering high value sustainable jobs for Cashel.  </p><p>The South East Region consists of 5 counties, Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and South Tipperary.  There are 63 multinational companies based in the South East, employing 11,919 people.  Generally the existing IDA client base has performed well and retained their presence in the South East.  The main clusters that have emerged in the South East are in high value manufacturing (pharmaceutical, medical devices and engineering), and International Financial Services. There is also a strong cluster of indigenous companies operating in the business services sector including Eishtec (Waterford and Wexford); Rigney Dolphin (Waterford); VHI, Bank of Ireland and Taxback.com (Kilkenny) and Maven TM (Carlow).  In addition, the region has a strong cluster of food and beverage companies such as Glanbia, Bulmers, Finches, Danone, Coca-Cola and Slaney Foods.</p><p>In the South East  region as a whole, the unemployment rate has fallen from 17.4% in  quarter 1 of 2011 to 12.8% at the end of quarter 1 2015, and while much more remains to be done, that is a considerable achievement in such a short time. </p><p>Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.  Additionally, a &euro;150 million property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation&rsquo;s regional goals.  IDA&rsquo;s property division is working to ensure each region has office and manufacturing buildings and Greenfield sites available to potential FDI and EI clients or other appropriate job creating enterprises and will work with local authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to each region.</p><p>In February, the Government announced details of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs: Regional</i>initiative which seeks to capitalise on the strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation.  The initiative will build on the success of the National Action Plan for Jobs, and encourage regional stakeholders - including enterprise agencies, Local Authorities, higher education institutions, other public bodies and the private sector - to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their own region. </p><p>In total, eight regional Action Plans will be developed and published this year. The first of these plans for the Midlands region covering counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath was launched on Monday 29th June. The regional Action Plan for the South East will be launched before the end of July.</p></reply>

This measure will be used to assess the level of funding required by each track.</p><p>The Indecon report which was published in July 2014 recommended that Bord na gCon actively engage in a programme of asset disposal in order to reduce debt levels. The report listed potential asset disposals that should be considered which include the site at Meelick near Limerick City, the old Henry Street head office Limerick, land in Cork and the Harold&rsquo;s Cross track. The report further recommended that the timing of these asset sales should be made in a manner which maximises the value for Bord na gCon and should take account of planning/zoning issues and market developments.</p><p>Bord na gCon have assured me that they currently have no plans to close any further tracks.</p></reply>

It provides support for the dairy sector, amongst other things, and includes grant-aid at 60% for investment in dairy buildings, milking machines, milk cooling and storage equipment and in-parlour feeding systems. Farmers must be below 40 years of age at the time of application and have been set up in farming within the previous five years. These qualifying criteria are laid down by EU regulation and I have no authority to vary them.  However, on 29 June 2015 I also announced the opening of the new TAMS II Dairy Equipment Scheme.   This Scheme is open to all farmers who meet the general eligibility criteria, offering a standard rate of aid of 40% to all. In recognition of the fact that there are young farmers out there who will not qualify for the Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme, I have directed that these farmers are to receive priority under the general scheme.  The specific areas of investment in this Scheme will include milking machines; milk cooling and storage equipment and in-parlour feeding systems but not dairy buildings. </p>  <p>  An indicative allocation of &euro;120m has been made available under the Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme and &euro;50m under the Dairy Equipment Scheme over the full RDP period.

The sampling of greyhounds for the detection of prohibited substances is a key element of Integrity Management at Bord na gCon. Anabolic steroids such as Stanozolol are not authorised for use within the Irish greyhound industry, stanozolol is a therefore a prohibited substance. </p>  <p>  I understand from Bord na gCon that the National Greyhound Laboratory (NGL) has accreditation status from the Irish National Accreditation Board which accredits the NGL to undertake sampling in compliance with the International Standard ISO/IEC 17025. </p>  <p>  The National Greyhound Laboratory has flexible scope accreditation. This means the laboratory is in a position to validate and add any prohibited substance to its scope of accreditation at any time. It is not the practice for a racing laboratory to list all substances for which it is accredited. </p>  <p>  The National Greyhound Laboratory, including through its relationship with other Laboratory services, provides the capacity to detect the anabolic steroid Stanozolol in samples obtained at licensed greyhound racing stadia. Bord na gCon is confident that these laboratory services, complemented by the use of intelligence lead sampling, can detect the unauthorised administration of Stanozolol to greyhounds where this has occurred. Bord na gCon has advised that it is currently awaiting confirmatory analysis of four samples obtained at licensed Stadia for the prohibited substance Stanozolol.</p>  <p>  I understand that Bord na gCon has recently conducted a review of its integrity and regulatory systems under the guidance of Professor Tim Morris (School of Veterinary Medicine &amp;amp; Science, University of Nottingham) with particular emphasis on sampling and analysis for the presence of prohibited substances and medication control issues.   </p>  <p>  This review is nearing completion and once it is finalised, I expect Bord na gCon to consider its recommendations with a view to identifying any amendments required to legislation, practices or policies to ensure both the advancement of Board na gCon&rsquo;s commitment to greyhound welfare, and to underpin the integrity of the Irish greyhound industry.   </p>  <p>  The scope of this review encompasses the capacity of the National Greyhound Testing Laboratory in Limerick, the general adequacy of the equipment used and the levels of testing for prohibited substances. The objective is to ensure that Bord na gCon will conform with best international practice.   </p>  <p>  I understand from Bord na gCon that in addition to testing samples at the National Greyhound Testing Laboratory in Limerick, it also sends samples for analysis to an appropriate laboratory in the UK as required from time to time.   </p>  <p>  I commissioned the Indecon report in recognition of the need to review and reform aspects of the greyhound sector, including matters relating to integrity services, and I view it as critically important that its recommendations are implemented, with a view to ensuring that the greyhound industry can reach its full potential and prosper into the future.</p></reply>

The report states: the industry employs just over 10,300 people directly and indirectly; employment in the greyhound industry is spread very widely across the country. This regional dispersion is reflected in the geographic spread of the 17 racetracks around the country and the ownership of greyhounds in every county; the employment is provided in catering at greyhound race tracks, staff employed at tracks owned by the Irish Greyhound Board, staff employed at the privately owned tracks, staff employed in cleaning and security services at all stadia, food and drink suppliers to catering operators, private and public trainers, greyhound food manufacturers and suppliers, ancillary services such as veterinary and medicine, dog owners, betting offices and a number of miscellaneous areas.</p></reply>

The ICC is subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon (BNG) under Section 26(2) of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 (the Act). BNG is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.  Detailed rules governing the practice of the artificial insemination of greyhounds were set down in the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations, 2005, (S.I. No. 561 of 2005), which were made by BNG under Section 39 of the Act.   </p>  <p>  The Regulations included a two year limit on the use of semen for artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog, thereafter any unused semen had to be destroyed.   </p>  <p>  As I have already outlined to the Deputy in Parliamentary Question 25645 for answer on Thursday 25th   June 2015, as a result of the operational difficulties in the implementation of certain provisions of the Artificial Insemination of Greyhound Regulations, 2005, Bord na gCon invited industry stakeholders in March 2014 to submit proposals regarding the suitability of the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005 in the context of meeting current industry requirements. </p>  <p>  After a detailed consideration of submissions received, Bord na gCon decided in September 2014, having consulted with the ICC, to remove the two year limit on the use of semen following the death of a stud greyhound. Arising from this decision, and with the consent of the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, new regulations were introduced by Bord na gCon which came into effect on November 1 st   2014 removing this two year limit on semen from an expired sire. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Bord na gCon that in conjunction with the Irish Coursing Club they have carried out preliminary research and discussions with various experts in the areas of Quantitative Genetics, Animal &amp;amp; Bioscience Research and Canine Genetics on the specific aspects such as pedigree analysis of inbreeding levels and rate of accumulation of inbreeding in the Irish Greyhound; developing a breeding program to ensure long term gains while simultaneously managing genetic diversity; the impact on the age of semen or age of semen donor on gene mutation rate. Following on from this, I understand that Bord na gCon have commissioned a scientific study dealing with topics outlined above with a view to assisting the Board in relation to policy development in this area.</p></reply>

They will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.    Prior to 2012, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 998/2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals, my Department allowed the import of pet cats or dogs (accompanied by their owner) under (a) an import licence issued by the Department authorising the import of the animal into public quarantine for a period of six months, or (b) an EU Pet Passport issued in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No. 998/2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals. In this case, the pet could only be brought through an approved entry point by an approved carrier. </p>  <p>  With effect from 1 January 2012, EU legislation no longer required pet cats, dogs and ferrets imported into the country to be quarantined.

In addition to the requirements relating to identification and rabies control etc., dogs/cats involved falling in the latter category may only be moved from a registered premises and must be accompanied during movement by a Pet Passport and a veterinary health certificate. Furthermore, the Member State of destination must be notified in advance of the arrival of the commercial consignment. </p>  <p>  Systems are also in place to prevent commercial movements being passed off as non-commercial. In addition, household pets being moved in groups of more than 5 must also be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate and the Member State of destination must be notified in advance of the arrival of the consignment.</p></reply>

The rate of inspection for Cross Compliance is a minimum of 1% of applicants to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and GAEC standards apply. However, 3% of the farmers must be inspected under bovine identification and registration requirements while 3% of sheep/goat farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.  The EU regulations prescribe that the selection of cases for inspection is undertaken by means of a risk analysis process, with cases being selected on a risk and random basis.  In addition, my Department is required to review the results of previous year&rsquo;s inspection to determine appropriate risks, which must include the criteria of previous penalties and non-compliances. The process for selecting cases for inspection has been subject to audit on numerous occasions, which has confirmed its compliance with the requirements of the EU regulations.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Single Farm Payment application of the person named was selected for a Cross Compliance inspection.

Member states have competence to authorise products containing EU-approved active substances.  Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide that must be applied directly to plant foliage for activity. It was first commercialised in the mid 1970s and is registered worldwide. It is used in agriculture, forestry, industrial, home and garden, and semi aquatic areas.</p>  <p>  Glyphosate is primarily used as a means of total weed control prior to the establishment of field crops or at the very end of the growing season to desiccate the crop to manipulate harvest date and improve crop quality. It is important to note that there is no alternative active substance with similar scope, purpose and safety profile.</p>  <p>  Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 regulates the authorisation, marketing and use of plant protection products and as such each registration must conform to the norms, methodologies and principles contained therein.  Glyphosate is currently registered in all EU Member States and was last reviewed in 2002, as part of the EU plant protection product review programme. A scheduled re-review is currently underway, with Germany acting as the rapporteur and Slovakia acting as the co-rapporteur. The process of peer reviewing the German/Slovakian evaluation is coming to a conclusion and it is expected that this process will be completed within the next few months. As part of the process the European Food Safety Authority is co-ordinating a review by all member states of its evaluation.</p>  <p>  When the International Agency for Research and Cancer (IARC) monograph on glyphosate becomes available (expected in August), the German evaluators will perform a thorough review of the classification issued by IARC. It should be noted that conclusions of this IARC review are contradictory to the conclusions reached by the JMPR (Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues) which like the IARC, is also an office of the United Nations. It is also important to note that the WHO has convened an expert task force to investigate the differing conclusions of two of its own bodies.</p>  <p>  All uses of glyphosate approved in Ireland (including Clinic Ace and Round Up) are in line with approved uses in all other EU Member States and are only granted if the appropriate risk assessment indicates that safe uses are possible under normal conditions.</p></reply>

Wicklow and there is no suggestion or evidence to support any claim that these findings would be replicated in other areas. A detailed examination, similar to the Wicklow one, of 17 deer in North Sligo found no evidence of infection with TB, although a small number of positive deer have been detected in isolated instances in different parts of the country.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that the level of TB reported in deer examined at abattoirs in the country is generally very low.  My Department monitors the incidence of TB in wild deer nationally through the analysis of suspect lesions or carcasses submitted by farmers and hunters who are permitted to slaughter deer under licence from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Submissions of deer since 1 January 2014 from farmers and hunters to our Regional Veterinary Laboratories indicate very low levels of TB in wild deer with the exception of parts of Wicklow.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, responsibility for wild deer rests with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under Wildlife legislation. The role of officials from my Department is to provide advice to keepers and their veterinary practitioners on disease control and bio-security measures in relation to wildlife, including deer. Officials from the Department are available on an on-going basis to discuss these issues with herd owners.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently passed on the results of the survey of 103 deer to the non-statutory Irish Deer Management Forum (IDMF) comprising an independent chairperson, representation from stakeholder groups, including farming, forestry, conservation, hunting and other interest groups as well as Coillte and officials from my Department and from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

The regulations require that a minimum of 5% of applicants must be inspected each year to ensure that the land declared for aid, including commonage type land, is in full compliance with the requirements.  My Department has a fully trained Inspection Unit to undertake these inspections. This unit interprets the governing EU regulations as they relate to inspection requirements and implements an inspection process to meet these requirements. The inspections are subject to repeated audit checks by the European Commission and European Court of Auditors thus ensuring an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements. The inspection process has been amended over time to reflect changes in the governing regulations and also to reflect findings contained in the various audit reports.</p>  <p>  Inspecting officers in my Department are regularly trained in inspection requirements on the eligible land cover types and on all the requirements to satisfy eligibility conditions. Continuous oversight by supervisors and random verification inspections are applied to ensure a consistent approach. In addition, the Inspection Unit participates fully at all meetings and workshops organised by the European Commission on all inspection requirements, including land eligibility matters related to the Birds and Habitats Directives, where Commission experts and experts from other EU member states share their knowledge. In this way the Inspection Unit has and continues to build up extensive knowledge on inspection requirements. This ensures that the EU regulatory requirements are being fully met and also that the training of the inspecting officers on inspection procedures is kept up-to-date.</p></reply>

The Natura 2000 measure provides for compensation to farmers for disadvantages in their farming activities arising out of 3 Directives &ndash; the Habitats Directive, the Wild Birds Directive and the Water Framework Directive. Under the 2007-2013 RDP, Natura 2000 is linked to both the REPS and AEOS agri-environment schemes, and applicants with Natura designated land are prioritised under AEOS.</p>  <p>  Participation in agri-environment schemes, including Natura, is voluntary on the part of farmers and expenditure is therefore demand led. Actual demand under the Natura measure during the 2007 &ndash; 2013 Programme proved to be significantly less than had been provided for. Therefore, the financial provision for Natura was revised to reflect the actual spend as the programming period progressed. This involved the reallocation of funds across the agri-environment and Less Favoured Areas schemes in Axis 2 of the RDP without changing the overall spend under that Axis.</p>  <p>  The members of the Rural Development Programme Monitoring Committee were informed of the proposed amendments to the RDP Financial Plan in April 2013 and asked for observations. The issue was included on the agenda of a RDP Monitoring Committee meeting in July 2013, where it was discussed and the amendments agreed by those present. The National Parks and Wildlife Service is a member of this Monitoring Committee, as are the representative farming organisations. While the National Parks and Wildlife Service has expressed concerns in writing in relation to this matter, the amendment to the RDP was agreed by the Monitoring Committee in full accordance with the regulatory and legislative process in place.</p>  <p>  In relation to the reference in the Indecon Report to a new Natura 2000 scheme, this refers to the introduction of the new Natura Scheme linked to the new Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) as part of the &ldquo;Health Check&rdquo; review of the Common Agricultural Policy in 2010. However, it should be noted that while these new Schemes were introduced following the allocation of additional &ldquo;Health Check&rdquo; European funding, payments continued to issue under the existing REPS and Natura 2000.</p>  <p>  While money was transferred from the Natura measure in 2013, it should be noted that expenditure under the agri-environment budget measures in the 2007-2013 RDP also complemented and incentivised farmers with Natura land to engage with the agri-environment scheme.</p>  <p>  In the new 2014-2020 RDP, Natura land is deemed a Priority Environmental Asset under the recently launched GLAS agri-environment scheme and thus expenditure on Natura lands will be continued and enhanced in the new programming period.

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  One of the requirements of the programme stipulates that from 30th June 2016, at least 80% of the AI used on participating holdings must be from 4 or 5 star bulls on either the terminal or replacement index. This complements the requirement that where a stock bull is used, at least one stock bull on the holding on the 30th June 2019 must be a genotyped 4 or 5 star bull on either the terminal or replacement index.</p>  <p>  There is a very wide range of AI bulls available for pedigree beef breeding that are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index. For example, ICBF recently completed its listing of recommended sires for bull breeders involved in the Gene Ireland maternal beef breeding program. In total there are some 164 bulls in that catalogue of which 151 (92%) are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index within or across breeds.</p>  <p>  There is no restriction on using imported sires under the scheme provided they receive a 4 or 5 star rating from the ICBF. The ICBF calculates a euro star evaluation for imported sires based on their foreign data so that they can be utilised under the scheme and the ICBF is engaging with its counterparts in other countries with a view to increasing access to the genotypes and the relevant data used in these evaluations. The approach used for assigning this rating is in line with that used for all other bulls under the eurostar rating system and it is important that any rating is based on objective, scientific criteria which the ICBF can justify to each and every farmer using such bulls. Indeed, the ICBF can provide an indication of the likely euro star rating to be given to such bulls in advance of importation into Ireland and I would urge pedigree breeders to avail of the services of the ICBF in this regard. Furthermore, the fact that 20% of the AI used can come from other types of bulls also gives scope for pedigree breeders that wish to use some outcross sires that do not meet the criteria of the scheme.</p></reply>

Malaria is a very serious disease. It kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone. It is a grave threat to any military force operating in that area. Let me be clear to the Deputy in relation to previous statements regarding Lariam. I have an open mind on the matter. However the Deputy must appreciate that any proposed change to the current policy would have to be considered on foot of medical advice or any changes in respect of the product authorisation or usage by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), formerly the Irish Medicines Board.  The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. That position has not changed.  As the Deputy will be aware, the HPRA is the statutory authority with responsibility for quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland. The Defence Forces policy, in relation to the use of anti-malaria medication, including Lariam, is in line with current HPRA approved summary of product characteristics (SmPC).</p>  <p>  Former Ministers for Defence have had the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concurred with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam are licensed by the HPRA. Lariam must remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel serving on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa. This is to seek to ensure effective protection for such personnel from malaria and from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

In this context, I would point out to the Deputy that the proposed amendments she has referred to, and which relate to the staffing of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, were not Government amendments and were, in fact, withdrawn. As the Deputy will appreciate, this is very much a human resource issue for careful consideration and wider than a matter of procurement of goods or services as such.</p><p>At the same time, and as reflected in the very constructive manner in which the relevant amendments were withdrawn, it is to be acknowledged that the proposed reforms to the legal professional conduct regime under the Bill will have implications for a number of existing and appropriately skilled staff who currently deal with public complaints made through the Law Society and the Bar Council, respectively. I understand that eighteen to twenty full-time equivalent posts are in question. I am also conscious of the support given by Deputies, both independent and from across the Parties, to finding a workable solution which can reconcile the competing human resource, regulatory independence and other considerations involved, during their detailed discussion of these very aspects of the Bill during D&aacute;il Committee Stage. I have also received, and continue to consider, representations on these matters from the legal professional bodies, from individual members of their staff and from trade union representatives.</p><p>I am, therefore, taking account of all of the concerns that are now in play as part of the ongoing consideration of the human and other resource aspects of the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal.  These are matters which are not solely within my own purview but continue to be negotiated between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which has overall responsibility for policy in these areas.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The outcome of these ongoing deliberations, which will take account of the legal and other aspects concerned, will inform those amendments relating to the staffing of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority that I expect to bring, with Government approval, before the Seanad.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>The intention is that the Bill be completed so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority can come into operation without delay this year.</p></reply>

There were 35 other deaths in the same attack, many of them holidaymakers from Britain, and our sympathy goes to the families and friends of all the victims.</p><p>The attack in Tunisia was another reminder to us of the real and persistent danger that is faced from terrorism and the fact that all states must remain vigilant and work together to counter the threat.  Ireland, like any other democratic state with similar values, is not immune to this threat and the Garda authorities keep the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in light of ongoing developments and they will continue to take all appropriate measures to counteract it.  In this they have the full support of the Government.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, the threat from international terrorism is a strong, shared concern for the European Union and actions to counter this threat are at the top of the agenda for the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.  A wide range of strong actions is being pursued at EU level on an ongoing basis to support the actions of the Member States in combating terrorism.  This co-operation has, naturally, been intensified given the ongoing concerns about the conflict in Syria and Iraq, the rise of ISIL and its utterly barbaric disregard for humanity and attacks in Europe and on Europeans, such as that in Tunisia.</p><p>I addressed these issues most recently with my EU counterparts at last month's JHA Council meeting which adopted conclusions on a renewed Internal Security Strategy for the EU, including a range of focused actions that are set out in the <i>European Agenda on Security</i>.  These actions include improved information sharing between law enforcement services; stronger co-operation with third countries, particularly those in North Africa and the Middle East affected by conflict; countering radicalisation, particularly through the European Radicalisation Awareness Network of experts and through interaction with the IT/internet industry; enhancing Europol&rsquo;s role in supporting the Member States, including through actions to tackle foreign terrorist fighters and violent, extremist content online; enhancing partnership with the IT/internet industry through an EU level forum with major IT and internet companies aimed at countering terrorist use of the internet; updating the EU legal framework as needed to address the foreign terrorist fighter phenomenon; strengthening the legal framework on firearms and improving co-operation with third countries in this regard; and taking further action against cybercrime.</p><p>I will continue to engage actively with the other EU Justice and Interior Ministers on these important issues once again this week at our meeting in Luxembourg.  What is essential is that we take a resolute and robust stance in defence of fundamental rights and our democratic way of life and we can best do that by continuing to work closely together.</p></reply>

I had met with the Director General of the Central Statistics Office last November to discuss the implications of the Report's findings and I am very grateful to the CSO for the professional and independent analysis which it has carried out.  This analysis is an important step in securing the integrity of our national crime statistics.</p>  <p>  The work of both the CSO and the Garda Inspectorate has identified common issues of concern in relation to Garda crime recording processes and systems.  Many of these issues have no doubt built up over time and it is true to say that similar issues have also been found with police data in other jurisdictions.  It is, however, essential that we have access to accurate, reliable data on crime so that the policing services offered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are responsive to current and emerging crime trends.  In addition, the public must have confidence that the published crime statistics are accurate.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na took a number of important steps to address the issues identified in relation to the recording of crime.  These have included the establishment of a new Data Quality Team within the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), and the piloting of a new incident recording process to test data review processes.</p>  <p>  I am greatly encouraged that, arising from and building on this work, the Commissioner has indicated that she expects a series of further new measures to be rolled out nationally later this year. These will ensure that all reports from the public to Garda stations and control rooms are logged in a consistent manner using a standardised method and that all incidents will be recorded and classified initially at the GISC.  This will reduce the number of incident classification decision makers and improve consistency.  Furthermore, changes to the PULSE system will ensure that the status of an investigation is correct at all times.  In addition, a new PULSE upgrade will enable District Officers to generate daily, weekly and monthly incident reviews of investigations. This will enhance accountability, governance and oversight of investigations.</p>  <p>  I might also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to other work being led by the CSO, in particular an Expert Panel it is Chairing to examine the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations on crime statistics, including with a view to the development of new crime counting rules. I believe this will be another important contribution to our efforts to improve crime data systems and processes.</p>  <p>  Finally, and as I stated when the recent CSO review was published, I am determined to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in developing its systems to meet the realities and expectations of 21st Century policing.  In particular I have been working closely with my colleague Minister Howlin to secure the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology and I hope to make significant announcements shortly in relation to the development of Garda ICT systems.</p></reply>

Armagh by the Provisional IRA in January 1976.</p>  <p>  The Garda Authorities have been engaged in an ongoing legal process to facilitate this co-operation in discussion with the Northern Ireland Coroner's Office.

I issued a Directive to the Garda Commissioner under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and I made Regulations under the Data Protection Act 1988, both of which I laid before the Oireachtas.

I met with the Stardust Victims and Relatives Committee last year and this meeting provided me with an opportunity to hear at first hand the ongoing concerns of the Committee in relation to this tragic event. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, these events were the subject of a Tribunal of Inquiry which reported in 1982 and an Independent Legal Examination which reported in 2009. The Report of the Independent Legal Examination concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest.  The then Government accepted these findings and motions were passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas endorsing these conclusions and expressing sympathy with the families.</p>  <p>  Following my meeting with the Committee and hearing their concerns, I appointed an official in my Department to liaise with the Committee and they have engaged with representatives of the Committee in relation to these matters. </p>  <p>  A researcher associated with the Committee submitted material relating to these events to my Department and a meeting was held with that Researcher, and another person associated with the Committee, on 23 April this year. The material previously submitted and the matters raised at that meeting continue to be examined in my Department.</p>  <p>  I wish also to inform the Deputy that allegations raised by the Stardust Relatives' and Victims Committee and their representatives in relation to certain matters are the subject of an ongoing investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am informed, by the Garda Commissioner, that this is a complex investigation and, you will understand, I cannot do anything that might cut across this investigation.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that Garda Vetting is an integral part of that licensing process.</p>  <p>  In general, Garda Vetting processing times fluctuate upwards and downwards depending on seasonal demands and volumes received, and depending on whether further enquiries have to be conducted in any individual application.  These enquiries may be conducted for many reasons such as verification of identity, updating incomplete records or establishing the outcomes of investigations or Court disposals.  In such instances processing times may be significantly longer than the general average.  Currently the average processing time is four weeks for 80% of Garda Vetting applications received.</p></reply>

However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Obair was launched in each Division in the Eastern Garda Region in April 2012. The primary objective of Operation Obair is to disrupt and prevent mobile and organised criminal groups from committing criminal offences, to apprehend suspects in the commission or the attempted commission of offences and to fully investigate, detect and, where possible, prosecute any offences outstanding against these suspects. Operation Obair is the specific burglary related operation which is in place in the Eastern Region to support the national operational strategy targeting burglary crime under Operation Fiacla. This approach provides both a preventative and detection element, and focuses on geographical areas and specific targets. Targeted offences include; burglary, aggravated burglary, robbery, possession of house breaking implements, possession of stolen property and trespassing. I am advised that, as of 30 June 2015, Operation Fiacla has led to the arrest of 13,736 persons with charges being brought against 7,828 persons nationally.  </p>  <p>  Under Operation Fiacla Gardai utilise the full range of specialist services available including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Money Laundering Investigation Unit and Organised Crime Unit, as well as Forensic Science Ireland. This approach is supported by local core policing units, including community Garda&iacute;, traffic corps and detective units, supported by the armed Regional Support Units and the Emergency Response Unit. Measures are also in place to target the use of motorways by criminal gangs and to disrupt and arrest those involved.  In this regard I recently announced additional resources for new specialised vehicles to support an enhanced operational response by Garda&iacute; to current and emerging crime threats, including burglary offences being committed by highly mobile gangs and I remain in ongoing contact with the Commissioner in relation to these matters.</p></reply>

The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction provides for the return of children who have  been removed from one contracting state to another, usually by one parent against the wishes of the other parent.    The European Council Regulation (2201/2003) applies to EU member states and enhances the provisions of the 1980 Hague Convention. </p>  <p>  Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention states, &rdquo;....the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that....b) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has stated, Article 11.4 of the European Council Regulation (2201/2003) states; &ldquo;A court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13 b of the 1980 Hague Convention if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the relevant judicial authority in the jurisdiction where the child has been taken to (which in Ireland is the High Court) to consider whether or not adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after their return to the requesting jurisdiction in cases where it is asserted that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or placed in an intolerable situation. When a decision is taken to either return or not return a child, such decisions can be appealed.  The Minister has no role in the judicial systems in this or other jurisdictions party to the 1980 Convention and Brussels II Regulation.</p></reply>

To that end a farm Theft Stop initiative has been developed and trialed in two counties &ndash; Donegal and Tipperary.  <i>Theft Stop</i>is a free farm theft prevention initiative that will provide participating members with a unique code to mark farm equipment and subsequently record this marked equipment on <i>www.theftstop.ie</i>.  Marking property acts as an effective crime deterrent and will help to reduce farm related theft.  <i>Theft Stop</i>members will, if desired, be able to purchase a stencil kit and/or metal punching set for application of their specific code.</p><p>The database will be kept and maintained by the IFA and will allow <i>Theft Stop</i>members to view an online directory of stolen farm machinery.  This will also assist the Garda in investigation, recovery and identification processes.</p><p>I understand that feedback from the trial is very positive and it is planned that the initiative will be rolled out nationally on a phased basis over the coming year starting with Laois, Offaly, Kilkenny, Carlow and Limerick.</p><p>In support of this, the IFA has recruited a Rural Crime Prevention and Safety Executive, who will work in conjunction with Garda Crime Prevention Officers.  I am further informed that to combat Metal Theft, which also affects the rural community, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established a Metal Theft Forum to promote a multifaceted approach to preventing theft of metals and bring key stakeholders together. The participating stakeholders include the IFA (Irish Farmers Association).</p><p>This collaborative approach has assisted in the development of knowledge and assisted intelligence gathering. It has resulted in raising awareness of Metal Theft through briefings of operational Garda&iacute; by key stakeholders and the National Crime Prevention Unit. It has facilitated the development external awareness raising measures through the use of the Garda Website, Crimecall and other media outlets.</p><p>In addition An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the Garda Metal Theft Crime Prevention and Reduction Plan in February 2013, which is available on the Garda website - <i>www.garda.ie</i>.</p></reply>

This does not include other very well publicised multi-agency investigations involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which led to significant drug seizures here and abroad including, for example,  the seizure on Ireland&rsquo;s south west coast last September of cocaine with an estimated street value of over &euro;358 million.</p>  <p>  We also continue to see the very successful targeting of crime gangs engaged in burglary crime through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Operation Fiacla which had, at the end of April this year, already led to over 13,000 arrests and  over 7,300 charges being brought against those involved. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware there have been a number of very positive recent developments with regard to the overall resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including, for example, the recent allocation of a further &euro;700,000 for new specialised vehicles to support the Garda in responding to current and emerging crime threats, including those committed by highly mobile gangs. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that there are inherent challenges in providing accurate figures with regard to the number of such groups operating at any particular time due to the fluidity of the groups. Organised crime, by its nature,  is constantly evolving and diversifying in both its structures and activities so as to exploit opportunities for criminal gain. Furthermore many modern organised criminal groupings are transnational in nature and poly-criminal in their activities.</p>  <p>  Having said that,  organised criminal gangs are targeted on an ongoing basis and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated. In addition, certain information with regard to the operation of such groups is disseminated at a European level through Europol.</p></reply>

It is within this context that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na develops crime prevention initiatives and community policing services for delivery by front line Garda resources.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na places great emphasis on the importance of the partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone. In this regard the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Within this framework, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle local crime issues including public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities and business groups, including the hospitality industry, to reduce crime and enhance community safety. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour and related criminality. I am advised that there is a community policing team in each Garda District.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the National Crime Prevention Unit (NCPU) operates in accordance to international best practice in developing and administering initiatives.  Finally, the Deputy will be aware of the review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road Agreement which will make recommendations on the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the resources available to it, with the objective of achieving and maintaining the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in its operations and administration.  More generally, it is also the case that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, in its reports on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, benchmarks the performance of the Force with best international policing practice.</p></reply>

Phase I is for 32 weeks at the Garda College, at the end of which successful students will be attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers).  Phase II is for 65 weeks based in Garda stations, and Phase III consists of seven weeks of exam preparation, exams and assessments (total 104 weeks).  The new programme will now result in an award of a Bachelor of Arts (Level 7) in Police Studies.</p>  <p>  Approximately 14,000 training days were delivered to Garda&iacute; through the College in 2014. These training programmes include continued professional development for members.

The latest statistics published are for the twelve month period ending with Quarter 1 of 2015 and they set out recent trends in recorded crime, showing decreases in most crime categories including a significant drop of 40% in homicide offences.  In addition Public Order offences were down by 7.9%, Robbery and Related Offences were down by 6.6% and Weapons and Explosives Offences decreased by 8.4%.  The full breakdown of the crime statistics has been published on the CSO website.  All crime trends are monitored by Garda management and appropriate policing responses are put in place at both a national and local level.</p>  <p>  The CSO also published an analysis of the issues arising from the Inspectorate Report and I welcomed this review as an important step in securing the integrity of our national crime statistics.  A programme of work is underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address the issues identified and further new measures are to be introduced later this year. It is essential that we have access to accurate, reliable data on crime, and the CSO will continue to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address the issues identified in relation to the recording of crime incidents and detections, and has also indicated that it will repeat its analysis of the data quality issues at regular intervals.</p></reply>

I have requested the CSO to provide the available statistics in relation to the matters referred to directly to the Deputy. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the specific deployment of Garda resources in relation to the issues referred to is a matter for the Garda authorities. In this regard, I am advised that the allocation of overall Garda resources is kept under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure these resources are put to the best possible use.  As he will also be aware, thanks to the resumption of recruitment, the Commissioner now has the capacity to deploy new Garda&iacute; for the first time since 2009. The first group of new garda&iacute; which attested in May this year have been stationed around the country, including in the Kildare Garda Division.  Similarly, investments also are being made in vehicles and IT, and in the recruitment of specialist professional staff.  Policing and community safety in Kildare will undoubtedly benefit from this injection of resources, as it will in all other Garda Divisions.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>Insofar as the specific measures in place to tackle burglary are concerned, the position is that Operation Fiacla is the national intelligence and analysis-led Garda operation targeting burglary crimes throughout the country, including Kildare.  As at end June 2015, the operation had led to the arrest of 13,736 persons with charges being brought against 7,828 persons nationally. </p><p>In addition, and arising from a review I initiated of the criminal justice system's response to burglary, I published the heads of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill which targets repeat burglary offenders through new measures relating to bail and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending.I can further advise the Deputy that I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner with a view to ensuring that Garda operations are responding effectively to burglary trends, and I have made specific funding available for new specialised vehicles  to support an enhanced operational response by the Garda to current and emerging crime threats, including burglary offences being committed by highly mobile gangs.</p></reply>

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  These are the criteria for access to legal aid under the Act and there is no limit placed on the number of times that a person can apply for legal aid.  I have no function in relation to individual judicial decisions regarding the granting of legal aid.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation, there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing or, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p></reply>

Considerable rationalisation has already taken place since the Government assumed office and work is underway to further rationalise the existing structures in order to provide for additional efficiencies and synergies.  In particular, the efficiencies involved relate to centralising the management and oversight of legal aid under the auspices of the Legal Aid Board.  This will bring greater rigour to the current system and ensure accrual of greater expertise in the management and delivery of legal aid, the ability to deploy resources in a more flexible fashion across the legal aid sector and central oversight of legal aid budgets and practices.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the provision of legal aid broadly falls into two separate categories, i.e criminal legal aid and civil legal aid.  The provision of civil legal aid in the State is already delivered through the Legal Aid Board. Criminal legal aid is granted by the Courts, through the Judiciary.</p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission also provides legal aid in connection with Mental Health Tribunals and the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board provides legal aid with in connection with reviews by itself of court orders to commit persons to the Central Mental Hospital (those found not guilty by reason of insanity).</p>  <p>  In terms of efficiencies, the Government agreed in late 2010 that responsibility for the management and administration of the main criminal legal aid and various ad-hoc schemes would be transferred to the Legal Aid Board.  To date, responsibility for the administration of the following ad-hoc schemes have been transferred to the Board:</p>  <p>  - Garda Station Advice Scheme - 1st October 2011</p>  <p>  - Custody Issues Scheme (formerly Attorney General&rsquo;s Scheme) &ndash; 1st January 2013</p>  <p>  - Criminal Assets Bureau Legal Aid Scheme &ndash; 1st January 2014</p>  <p>  The Government also plans to transfer the responsibility for legal aid at Mental Health Tribunals to the Legal Aid Board subject to the necessary legislative amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.</p>  <p>  In the case of civil legal aid the Legal Aid Board continues to strive to achieve the most efficient use of its resources through the management of its Law Centre network and the use of panels of Private Practitioners.  Steps taken include a start-to-end case management system in its law centres, the introduction of a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach in all law centres to ensure early legal advice is available, piloting the use of private solicitors in additional areas of work, piloting mandatory information sessions about mediation where there is a dependent child, and restructuring its management/support function.  The numbers waiting for services from the Board have dropped from just over 5,000 on the 1st January 2014 to just under 2,900 on the 1st July last.  It should be noted that despite financial pressures, my Department's financial allocation to the Legal Aid Board has not been cut over recent years.</p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of criminal legal aid, I wish to advise the Deputy that I consider that the Criminal Legal Aid system operates reasonably efficiently within its current legislation in terms of the absence of a waiting period associated with the granting of criminal legal aid to persons charged before the courts.  The Deputy will be aware that under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the Courts, through the Judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid upon the applicant's appearance in Court.  However, a new Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill is currently being drafted which will update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  It is anticipated that the legislation will be enacted in 2016.</p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid where appropriate.</p>  <p>  Overall, this Government has made significant strides in rationalising and improving the efficiency of the legal aid system but this is an ongoing project with additional steps, as set out above, to be taken over the coming number of months.</p></reply>

This table was originally published in 2007 in Maternity and Child Welfare in Dublin 1922-1960 by Lindsey Earner Byrnes and was reproduced in the report of the Inter Departmental Group in 2014 to help to illustrate mortality rates in various Mother and Baby Homes compared with mortality among the general population at that time.</p><p>As I have previously outlined, the 2012 draft report and the data it contains, was prepared by the Health Service Executive (HSE) based on records from the former Bessborough mother and baby home as part of its response to the <i>Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries.</i>This process, which was independently chaired by Martin McAleese, was conducted under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>In the course of this work the HSE provided the draft report to the Committee secretariat and to the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The draft report acknowledged that its conclusions remained a matter of conjecture until such time as a more forensic examination of the home&rsquo;s records could be undertaken by the HSE.</p><p>As the issues raised in the draft report regarding death rates in Bessborough were outside the direct remit of the McAleese Committee, the HSE advised that these and other concerns would be examined separately by the HSE.  At that time my Department advised the HSE that any validated findings of concern from this separate process should be appropriately communicated by the HSE.  My Department is not aware of any subsequent report on this matter by the HSE.</p><p>The Government has now established a statutory Commission of Investigation to provide a full account, in a timely manner, of what happened to vulnerable women and children in Mother and Baby Homes.  Bessborough Mother and Baby Home is included in this investigation.  I am confident that the Commission&rsquo;s extensive remit will facilitate a full and transparent inquiry into all related matters and its reports will be published.  An investigation of the rates of mortality, and related concerns, are central to the Commission's Terms of Reference (S.I. No. 57 of 2015).  The process of assembling and investigating all relevant records now forms a significant part of the Commission&rsquo;s work.</p></reply>

This funding is largely directed towards a number of childcare programmes, which aim to improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of early years and school-age care and education.  These programmes support the provision of early years and school-age care and education for more than 100,000 children each year.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all the benefits of this (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  It is critically important that any investment is designed to achieve the best outcomes for children and their parents.  Accordingly, earlier this year, I established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in early years and school-age care and education.  Membership of the Group includes representation from right across Government, including the Departments of Education and Skills, Jobs and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and as well as the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and an Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The work of the Group is being informed by research and evidence of best practice and by existing policy commitments, including those set out in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People.</p>  <p>  To inform its work, the Group has solicited the views of key stakeholders, interested parties and the general public through a number of consultative processes, including an Open Policy Debate on Future Investment in Early Years and School-Age Care and Education Services, which was hosted by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on 31st March 2015 and attended by some 40 invited representatives including parents, providers, academics, childcare committees, and NGOs.</p>  <p>  It has also held a series of bilateral discussions with relevant Government Departments, including the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills, Finance, Jobs and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Two separate online consultation processes - one with the early years sector and one with parents and guardians have also taken place and the approximately 400 submissions received from the early years sector and almost 1,000 submissions received from parents and guardians are currently being analysed.</p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Group will submit its report to Government shortly.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that all significant risks were addressed immediately.  In particular, steps were taken to address the information systems being used to formally document cases, and to improve record keeping and the updating or validating of data.  HIQA was satisfied with the action plan to address the significant risks that were identified.  In fact, most of the actions needed to address HIQA&rsquo;s immediate concerns were completed prior to the publication of the report.  Over half of all actions in the HIQA action plan have been achieved, with the remaining actions on track to be completed within the indicated timescales.</p>  <p>  Issues were highlighted around resources and staffing in Louth Meath.  This is being addressed at national level as a matter of urgency.  Tusla has been preparing a national review of cases waiting allocation of a social worker.  I expect that this will be submitted to me shortly and this will inform the overall approach by Tusla for the budget and deployment of social work staff.  Overall, Tusla employed 3446.55 people (whole-time equivalents) at end of May 2015.  Of these, 1408.31, or 41% of the workforce, were social workers.  The number of social workers employed by Tusla has increased by 12 since the start of 2015 and by 40.68 since the agency's inception in January 2014. At end of May, 128 social workers were under active recruitment to Tusla.  It is important to recall that in addition to frontline child welfare and protection services, social workers are required to fulfil other Tusla functions, such as the recruitment and assessment of foster families.  Officials from my Department have already been engaging with Tusla on resources for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016.  A submission on staffing and other resource issues is to be made in the near future.  Tusla has indicated that it is currently looking at ways to improve the rate at which staff can be recruited.</p>  <p>  The Chief Operations Officer has assumed direct management oversight of the special programme for improvement and has been overseeing the implementation of the comprehensive action plan which has been agreed with HIQA.  The COO is project owner of the implementation steering group.  In addition to the HIQA action plan, further steps were identified by Tusla and are well underway.  An experienced short term social work team was put in place to assess the backlog of cases.  This has involved a significant number of cases being closed, being referred to other appropriate services, and the remaining cases were prioritised to be allocated a social worker.  The supports for the intervention in Louth Meath are currently being resourced with a Team Leader and a number of social workers.  As of 24 June, Tusla has reported that this action is also complete.  Specific training provision is on track and includes training on thresholds, assessment guidance and the Child Protection Notification System.  Actions for the implementation of supervision policy and the oversight of audits as part of the monthly review process are complete.  Overall 9 out of 17 actions identified by Tusla were completed by 24 June, with a further 6 actions on track for completion over the course of the summer.  Only 2 of the actions have revised timelines since the implementation plan was put in place, one relating to a business case to expand the provision of local prevention partnership &amp;amp; family supports (PPFS) and one about an approach to quality assurance audits.  Both of these are expected to be completed before the end of the summer.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the inspection findings were not all about deficits.  It was found that many children have benefitted from the service and that there was evidence of good practice and excellent inter-agency collaboration in Louth Meath.  Good practice with children and families was observed by inspectors.  Reforms on how the service provided by Tusla is organised nationally are taking effect.  I am committed to seeing the reforms underpin a service that delivers a consistent, responsive and safe child welfare and protection service for the children and families of Louth Meath and the country.</p></reply>

A number of actions have been taken on foot of this commitment.  These include the gradual transition of responsibility for older children to the Oberstown campus, the construction of the expanded detention facilities, the introduction of cross - campus procedures and staffing rosters, the introduction of a single campus management structure and the first recruitment programme for new care staff in many years.  More broadly, these changes have taken place in parallel with the important agenda of public sector reform under the Croke Park and Haddington Road Agreements.  As for other areas of the public service, this has created challenges.  However, I am confident that as these challenges are overcome, there will be a secure foundation for the children detention service into the future.  Working in concert with the Oberstown Board of Management, I am committed to the best possible support for both children in custody and the staff that deliver this important service.</p>  <p>  In the case of children in custody, a number of initiatives have been put in place in recent years to build on the child focused model of detention in Oberstown.  An advocacy service has been introduced under the aegis of the Empowering Children in Care organisation (EPIC) which is available to each child in detention.  In addition, the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS) has been introduced.  This is a shared multi - disciplinary service with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency which allows for each child to be screened on admission for any therapeutic supports that may be required.  A pilot project is also underway this year involving the provision of a dedicated package of pre and post release supports to a number of young people by the Youth Advocates Programme Ireland organisation (YAP).  This is in addition to the normal support services provided via care worker staff and management and the education staff employed the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  Finally, a new education and training building is due to be opened for children for the September school year, which has been provided under the Oberstown capital development programme.</p>  <p>  In the case of the staff on the Oberstown campus, new supports are being provided in the form of new physical detention buildings and the first recruitment programme on the Oberstown campus in many years, including expanded nursing cover for children.  This programme has also included internal promotion opportunities for existing staff on the campus.  I understand that in the past year, the Oberstown management has engaged staff in a new Health, Safety and Welfare Committee and a new Policy and Operations Consultative Committee.  There is also extensive interaction between management and staff on the Oberstown campus on the secure operation of the facility, safeguarding practices for children and staff health, safety and welfare issues.  I recognise that there are frequent industrial relations issues on the Oberstown Campus, which to a degree may be seen in the context of the large degree of organisational changes being experienced on that site at present.  These issues are being pursued through normal industrial relations structures through negotiations which are taking place with staff representatives.  If required there is also scope for recourse to third party conciliation and if required, adjudication by the Labour Court under the Haddington Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  The report referred to by the Deputy was commissioned in 2013 and related to care issues and operational issues on the Oberstown campus.  The report is the subject of a human resources process on the Oberstown campus.  This process is ongoing and I am advised that no steps can be taken at this time which could be interpreted as prejudicial to this process.</p>  <p>  I also note that the recent inspection of the Oberstown campus by HIQA has resulted in an agreed action plan being developed and implemented on the Oberstown campus.  This will also ensure safe and secure custody and operation of the Oberstown facility for both children and staff, in line with best care practice.  I wish to record my full support for the robust inspection framework that is in place under the Children Act 2001 and delivered by HIQA.</p></reply>

The provision of pre-school childcare services are governed by the Child Care Act 1991 and the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006.  It is currently a requirement of the Regulations that a person proposing to carry on a pre-school service shall, at least 28 days before the commencement of the service, give notice in writing to the Child and Family Agency.  Section 55 of the Child Care Act places a duty on the Agency to inspect services for which it receives notification.</p>  <p>  Amendments have been made to the Child Care Act 1991 to underpin proposed reforms and Regulations giving effect to these legislative changes are expected to be published shortly.  The new Regulations will impose qualification requirements of a minimum Level 5 award on the National Qualifications Framework (NFQ) in early childhood care and education for all staff working in early years services (no requirement currently exists).  This requirement will apply from September 2015 in the case of new services, and from September 2016 in the case of existing services.</p>  <p>  These new Regulations will also introduce a new registration system that will require anyone who wants to establish an early years service to register with the Child and Family Agency before they open.  Premises will be inspected by the Early Years Inspectorate before registration is granted, and there will be on-going inspections once the service is operating and children are attending.  These new Regulations will also be accompanied by new National Standards for Early Years Services, against which services will be inspected.  A second and separate phase of inspection, which will monitor the child care related criteria, will be carried out after the service has become operational and children are attending.</p>  <p>  Each year, my Department provides some &euro;13 million to City and County Childcare Committees and National Voluntary Childcare Organisation.  This funding supports the work of these bodies in supporting early years&rsquo; services around the country, through training, continuing professional development programmes, networking and cluster-type support groups.  They are an invaluable source of information and support for those wishing to become a childcare provider.</p></reply>

In September 2014 officials from my Department and the Child and Family Agency met with the National Carers' Association to discuss the role of the Department and the Agency in relation to the National Carers' Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 brings together a range of existing services for children and families to one agency.  The Child and Family Agency is responsible for the former Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and also for the functions of Child and Family services previously provided by the HSE.  The Agency's functions include maintaining and developing services in order to support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children and to support effective functioning of families.  In so doing the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation to ensure that services are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000.  The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities.  It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015/16 academic year.  The Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its service strands.</p>  <p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles.</p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy is also being developed by my Department for all young people aged 10 to 24 years.  It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.  I am pleased that representatives of the Carers' Association participated in the consultation process in the development of this strategy.</p></reply>

Data in respect of 2015 is not currently available.</p>  <p>  The judiciary are independent in the performance of their functions and the discretion as to whether or not to remand a child in custody is solely for the judge to decide. Section 88 of the Children Act 2001 allows that a court may remand a child in custody who is charged with or found guilty of an offence, who is being sent forward for trial or in respect of whom the court has postponed a decision.  The section also provides that a court shall not remand a child in custody if the only reason for so doing is that the child is in need of care or protection or the court wishes Tusla, the Child and Family Agency to assist it in dealing with the case.   In addition, section 76B of the existing Act provides for the involvement of Tusla in such cases, as deemed necessary by a Court.</p>  <p>  As provided for in various District Court rules, a child may be remanded in custody in the Children&rsquo;s Court for an initial period not exceeding 8 days and subsequently, for an individual period not exceeding fifteen days.  Children can be remanded in custody for successive periods within this framework but they are brought back before the Court at regular intervals.  While there is no legislation governing the length of remand periods in the Circuit Criminal Court for children, the right to an expeditious trial applies to every accused person irrespective of age.  Section 100 of the Children Act 2001 provides that where a Court is satisfied as to the guilt of a child, it may remand a child in custody for the purpose of preparation of any necessary reports but for not longer than 28 days, and this period may only be extended once by a maximum of 14 days.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that all children remanded in custody have access to independent legal assistance.

In addition, section 76B of the Children Act provides for the involvement of Tusla in such cases, as deemed necessary by a Court.</p>  <p>   The jurisdiction to refuse bail can be described as falling into two main categories:  the &ldquo;O&rsquo;Callaghan principles&rdquo; and section 2 of the Bail Act 1997.  In the 1966 Supreme Court case of the People v O&rsquo;Callaghan, the Supreme Court stated that in order to refuse bail, the court must be satisfied that it appears probable that the accused will abscond if admitted to bail or that it is reasonably probable that he or she will interfere with prospective jurors or witnesses, tamper with evidence or dispose of illegally acquired property.  This allows for issues such as the seriousness of the charge and the nature of the evidence in support of the charge to be properly considered by a Court.   In addition, section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 provides that a court may reject an application for bail where it reasonably considers it necessary to prevent a person who has committed a serious offence from committing another serious offence.  Children accused of serious offences may be refused bail under section 2 if the text is met and the relevant matters are appropriately considered.  </p>  <p>  As a general principle, it should be noted that all orders to either remand a child in custody or remand a child on bail in the community are made in individual court cases.  The judiciary are independent in the performance of their functions and the discretion as to whether or not to remand a child in custody is solely for the presiding judge to decide.  In addition, all children remanded in custody have access to independent legal assistance.

Relevant criteria include whether the child is remanded in custody or serving a sentence of detention, the age of the child, any physical or mental health issues presenting, the child&rsquo;s educational background, the nature of the offences involved,  the pattern of offending behaviour, the length of time to be served in custody and any physical or mental health issues.</p>  <p>  A small number of young people are occasionally in custody on the Oberstown campus in excess of the age of 18 years.  This could arise where the young person in question is remaining on the campus under section 155 of the Children Act 2001, which provides that young people may remain under certain conditions past the 18th birthday in a children detention school for a maximum period of 6 months.  Such young people remain within the legal definition of a child for the purposes of Part 10 of the Children Act 2001.  The purpose of this provision is to minimise the progression of children into the adult prison system.  This factor is taken into account when deciding and reviewing where individual children in custody should reside, along the other criteria outlined above.  However, it should be noted that age is not the only factor considered and all relevant criteria are taken into account on an individual basis as part of the child focused model of detention that is in place on the Oberstown campus.</p></reply>

Women, who currently reside outside of Ireland, can access the health services when they visit Ireland.  However, the RWRCI Act is not applicable in other countries and, therefore, it does not provide them with health services outside of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have focused on implementing the Act for the majority of women living in Ireland and I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, last week, the HSE corresponded directly with all the women living in Ireland who are eligible to avail of the services.</p>  <p>  However, I would emphasise that the HSE, with my Department, are also exploring the practical arrangements to be put in place for the overseas women, the vast majority of whom reside in the United Kingdom. The Deputy will be aware that all health systems around the world vary in organisation and that each system is practically unique and equally complex. The HSE has already been in contact with the women living abroad and has advised them that this issue is being examined and, when practical arrangements are in place, they will be contacted further. </p>  <p>  While I acknowledge that this important and complex matter is taking longer than anticipated, I am satisfied with the work undertaken by the HSE and my Department and I hope that the systems will be in place as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Government decided that the preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme. The Health (Transport Supports) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for 2015.  On foot of a Government decision, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed, on the basis that this would prevent hardship and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p></reply>

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of  multi-disciplinary primary health care.</p><p>Primary care infrastructure at the following locations will be delivered using the public private partnership (PPP) mechanism.  These are Coolock/Darndale - Dublin north city; Summerhill, north inner city Dublin; Kilcock; Wexford Town; Waterford City; Dungarvan; Carrick-on-Suir; Limerick City - Ballinacurra/Weston; Tuam; Boyle; Ballymote;  Claremorris,  and Westport.  The HSE included Ballinrobe as a suitable substitute for PPP for locations in the west which could not be progressed.  Considerable progress has been made in developing this project.  Following a detailed tender evaluation process the National Development Finance Agency announced the Prime-Balfour Beatty consortium as the preferred tenderer in May 2015.  Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2016 and it is expected that the primary care centres will be delivered by early 2017.  In the meantime work is continuing on the financial and legal provisions of the project contract.  Additional detail on the project is available on this website: <i>www.ndfa.ie/TenderCompetitions/PrimaryCareCentresPPPProgramme.htm</i>.</p><p>Awards of planning have been obtained for Crumlin/Drimnagh and Knocklyon/Rathfarnham but unfortunately this was not within the timeframe for inclusion in the PPP project. </p><p>As regards the remaining locations, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is  subject to  suitable locations being offered/provided/available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.  To date it has not been possible to satisfactorily progress Donegal town.  </p><p>The following locations have been included in the HSE's multi-annual Capital Plans to be delivered by direct/own-build - Dungloe; Tullow/Rathvilly/Hacketstown; and Rowlagh/North Clondalkin.  It had been intended to delivery Laytown/Bettystown and Rathdrum by means of the direct-build mechanism.  However, the proposal is to deliver both by operational lease.  </p><p>Kells is to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism; its construction will be completed later this year as set out in the HSE's NSP 2015.  The operational lease mechanism is also the preferred delivery option for the following locations - Balbriggan which is under construction, Drogheda north, Swords and Tralee.  In its November 2014 advertisement for primary care infrastructure to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism the HSE advertised, in addition to others, the following locations - Kilkenny city; Cork city for Togher; Clonmel; Thurles; Ennis; Gort and Ballaghadereen.  The closing date for receipt of Expressions of Interest was mid-January 2015, following which the HSE began reviewing the submissions  received to determine which are suitable for more detailed consideration and progression to the next stage of the process.  Locations are at various stages in the process and a more comprehensive update on this process will be available by end Q3 2015.  Although Carrickmacross was included in the November 2014 advertisement no expression of interest was received.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  They are not political or Ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  In May 2013 the HSE decided that it could not approve the reimbursement of Fampridine (Fampyra) under the GMS or other schemes as the manufacturer had failed to demonstrate or provide any formal justification for the prices proposed.  The HSE decision was in line with many other European countries who have also, to date, not provided for the drug under their public health systems.</p>  <p>  The HSE re-engaged with the company in July 2014 (and again in October 2014) seeking improved commercial offerings.  The outputs of those commercial engagements were re-considered by the HSE Drugs Committee at its November 2014 meeting.</p>  <p>  The Committee decided to seek additional detailed information from clinical experts as to how a responder only reimbursement scheme (i.e patients confirmed as positive responders to the medication) would operate for this product.

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008.   However, the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services and to fund development posts, including speech and language therapists. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in Budget 2014 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.  The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised that the HSE and Department of Health will be required to submit a Pay and Numbers Strategy as part of the revised arrangements.  The HSE are currently finalising this submission.  Pending approval by DPER, the existing arrangements will continue to apply.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the other aspects of his question.

It is intended that the register of Individual Health Identifiers will be implemented first, only after commencement of the Act, and this will allow for identifiers to be assigned to individual patients.  The identifiers will be used in both the public and private healthcare settings, including community health centres managed by HSE staff.</p>  <p>  Preparations for the implementation of the Individual Health Identifier are at an advanced stage by the HSE.  The necessary management and organisational structures to enable the establishment of the register are currently being put in place.  A development plan is being drafted along with a  Privacy Impact Assessment which is nearing completion.  </p>  <p>  With the initial completion of the register the next phase will be to allow for other health care ICT systems in both primary and acute care to access the register and make it available as the Act permits.  The work will be done on a phased basis over a number of years.  Access to the register of individual health identifiers and the use to which the identifier can be put is strictly controlled by the Act.  It is intended to be widely used in health and social care settings throughout the health services to enhance patient safety and underpin efficiency.  The Commencement Order which is necessary for the formal commencement of the relevant provisions in the Act for this stage of the implementation process, and which is drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in conjunction with my Department, is currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  HIQA have recently engaged in a public consultation exercise on "Draft Governance and Management Standards for Health Identifiers Operator in Ireland" which will assist in underpinning a governance framework for the operation of the system of identifiers to ensure trust and confidence of the health identifiers system in the country. It is important to point out that the roll out of a system of health identifiers for patients, professionals and organisations has no linkage with any eligibility for any type of health service or benefit.</p></reply>

The Taskforce met on a monthly basis and published an action plan on 2 April 2015 which sets out a range of time defined actions to (i) optimise existing hospital and community capacity; (ii) develop internal capability and process improvement and (iii) improve leadership, governance, planning and oversight.</p>  <p>  Based on the Task Force's Action Plan, additional funds of &euro;74 million were provided in 2015 to increase the number of long term nursing home care places and reduce the waiting time for the funding of such places, as well as providing additional transitional care beds and home care packages to provide viable supports for those no longer needing acute hospital care.  This additional funding came on top of measures already taken in Budget 2015, when the Government provided &euro;25 million to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressure on, acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  In June, I convened an ED Taskforce Implementation Oversight Group.  The Group met on 15 and 29 June and is scheduled to meet again on 20 July.  The HSE is engaged in a focussed programme of work to ensure immediate actions are being taken to effect a reduction in delayed discharges and to drive improved performance in EDs.  Overall the emphasis in implementing the ED Taskforce Action Plan is on driving a more integrated approach between primary care, acute hospitals and community care.  Progress against the various actions in the plan, including the &euro;74 million Delayed Discharges Initiative will be reported on a monthly basis to the ED Taskforce Implementation Oversight Group.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific question raised on the actions which have already been implemented, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.  </p></reply>

It does this through a well-established community focus and collaborative working with users of the service, carers and advocates.  A priority for the service is the provision of patient-centred, recovery orientated services, in line with  <i>A Vision for </i>Change, including Community Mental Health Teams, Home Focus Teams, a Recovery Bus, Trialogue Groups for family and friends and liaison with community and voluntary sector organisations, all of which are a fundamental part of an overall response to mental health needs in any area.</p><p>In relation to the availability of mental health services on a 24/7 basis I wish to advise the Deputy that specialist Mental Health Services generally, have  reconfigured to provide Community Mental Health Teams for children and young people, working age and older adults. These Teams have the ability to respond to urgent/crisis referrals by GPs with most teams having slots for urgent cases to be seen that day or the next working day.</p><p>Outside normal working hours, all mental health services also have a crisis response capability provided through the on-call medical system which operates in all acute hospitals with a 24-hour Emergency Departments.  This on-call system consists of a consultant psychiatrist together with an NCHD. The consultants and NCHDs work within the Community Mental Health Teams or in the Hospital Liaison Services and provide the on-call service in addition to their day time commitment with Community Mental Health Teams.</p><p>In addition, there is now a National Clinical Programme for the Assessment and Management of Patients presenting to Emergency Departments following Self-Harm. This is based on the recruitment of Clinical Nurse Specialists in psychiatry who work in Emergency Departments to provide a more rapid response to those who present with episodes of self-harm. </p><p>The HSE in its Service Plan for this year also commits to developing weekend services for existing vulnerable patients attending the mental health services that would benefit from contact over the weekend. This could be by way of phone call, attendance at the base in which the nurses are working or a domiciliary visit. This is already available in a number of areas.</p></reply>

There is no additional charge to medical card holders for this service.</p>  <p>  There is an arrangement under the GMS Scheme for the emergency supply (i.e. within 24 hours) of medicines for medical card holders on discharge from hospital. Community pharmacists are authorised to dispense a maximum of seven days supply of medicines prescribed for persons who have been in-patients in a hospital or who have attended an Emergency Department and because of the circumstances of their discharge and/or the urgency of the prescribed medication it would not be possible to attend their GP to have the hospital prescription transcribed to a GMS prescription form. This arrangement relieves any difficulties that patients might encounter due to being discharged from hospital late in the evening or at weekends.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that it is best clinical practice that a person in need of treatment should regularly attend their GP and that the GP is fully aware of the medications that any patient may be prescribed.  This is entirely consistent with the gatekeeper role played by the GP in the delivery of primary care. As GPs receive an annual capitation fee per GMS patient, there are no extra costs incurred by such patients.</p></reply>

This new Strategy, which succeeds and builds upon <i>Reach Out</i>our previous suicide prevention strategy, is based on current national and international evidence in relation to effective suicide prevention strategies. It sets out two primary outcomes, which include reduced suicide rate in the whole population and amongst specified priority groups; reduced rate of presentations of self-harm in the whole population and amongst specified priority groups.</p><p>While I do not have a role in relation to suicide prevention strategies in other jurisdictions, I can assure the Deputy that there is ongoing information sharing on best practice between the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention and colleagues in the United Kingdom in relation to suicide prevention.  In addition, officials from my Department and the National Office work closely with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland.  There are many areas where the two jurisdictions collaborate to mutual benefit, including research, evaluation, awareness raising, piloting new approaches, sharing learning and good practice.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), through the Emigrant Support Programme, supports organisations which help the most vulnerable among our emigrant communities.  Supported projects include those which deliver improved mental health and help access statutory mental health services, in particular for those with complex needs, newly&ndash;arrived emigrants and the elderly.  DFAT also provides direct consular assistance to individuals on a variety of issues, which may include mental health.</p></reply>

The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p><p>The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them. The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. </p><p>The healthcare being sought under the CBD can only be healthcare that a person would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation. Referral for care under the CBD can be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians. It will be a matter for the patient and his/her referring doctor to identify the clinician abroad and satisfy him/herself in relation to the qualifications, quality and safety of the services being availed of in the other jurisdiction. </p><p>Prior authorisation may be required from the HSE for certain healthcare. The costs must be borne by the individual and he/she then will seek reimbursement for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-07a.1058.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070700075#WRR02000"><p>Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 was commenced on 1 June 2007 in respect of children aged under 5.  In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following a High Court ruling, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the HSE as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act. Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  </p>  <p>  Although the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the Assessment of Need (AON) process, given the number and complexity of cases, it has taken a number of measures to address the issue. It has issued guidance to its staff that, where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child. While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  </p>  <p>  In 2011, the Department of Health and the HSE jointly commissioned the National Disability Authority (NDA) to review the operation of the Assessment of Need (AON) process in the HSE.  This report was published by the NDA and can be accessed at www.nda.ie. The NDA research has found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  It also found that where integrated children's disability teams have already been established under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme, the AON process has worked more smoothly.  In light of the NDA&rsquo;s findings, an additional emphasis is currently being placed on re-configuring children's disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically based early-intervention and school-aged teams, as part of the HSE's Progressing Disability Services Programme. The aim of this Programme is to bring about equity and consistency, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their difficulty.  The Programme is a key priority for the HSE's Social Care Directorate.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year).  The transition to this new service model is taking place on a phased basis and includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, including service users and their families.</p>  <p>  My Department has asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the specific detailed operational information he has requested.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papilloma virus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  </p>  <p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil&reg; is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil&reg;  .  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.  </p>  <p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil&reg; has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit/risk profile for Gardasil&reg; remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.</p>  <p>Up to the 8 June 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 873 reports of suspected adverse reactions/events notified in association with Gardasil&reg;.  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil&reg;  .  The majority of the reports received to date involved events/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.</p>  <p>The HPRA continues to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of all vaccinations licensed in Ireland including HPV meet the required standards.  The safety profile of Gardasil&reg;   has been continuously monitored since it was first introduced both nationally and at EU level and like all medicines and vaccines will continue to be so.</p></reply>

Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  To manage the available funds through the year, the HSE operates a national placement list in order of when applications are approved. Funding is released in strict chronological order as it becomes available. </p>  <p>The Budget for the Scheme in 2015 is &euro;993m, an increase of &euro;54m from the 2014 position  . </p>  <p>  In order to be an &lsquo;approved nursing home&rsquo; for the purposes of the NHSS, all private and voluntary nursing homes must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is a necessary feature of the Scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. If price negotiations break down a three stage review process, developed by the NTPF, can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.</p>  <p>  The review of the Scheme is almost completed and is expected to be published shortly.  This review considered the Scheme&rsquo;s long term sustainability as well as looking at how well the current model of provision is balancing residential care with care in the community, and whether this needs to be adjusted to better reflect what older people want. </p>  <p>  Nurses who trained in a country outside of Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as a nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). In assessing an applicant for registration, to protect the public, the NMBI seeks evidence from applicants of comparable standards of education and practice. According to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) the timeframe for the completion of the assessment of qualifications for registration takes up to a maximum of 90 days provided all necessary documentation has been supplied by the applicant. The main difficulty to expediting timely applications as reported by the NMBI is that of delay/failure by the applicant or third parties to furnish the necessary documentation required to assess eligibility for registration and the overall volume. It is important to note that the NMBI are dealing with very significant volumes of applications at present.  The NMBI are processing all applications as quickly as possible, while ensuring appropriate procedures and checks which are designed around protection of the public.  </p>  <p>  NMBI, following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant nurse or midwife to undertake a period of adaptation and assessment, which if required, must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration. This clinical adaptation period may last between 6-12 weeks. </p>  <p>  Clinical adaptation is a process of adjustment and assessment to support candidates who have not worked in the Irish health system previously. NMBI require that adaptation takes place in an appropriate setting approved by the Board and within a certain timeframe. The minimum timeframe for completing the period of adaptation and assessment is six weeks. Any site that has approval for students or wishes to seek approval as a new site to be considered for adaptation and assessment purposes needs to submit a request, with supporting documentation, directly to NMBI and NMBI will review accordingly.   NMBI has to date received one such request from a nursing home facility &ndash; a decision on same has yet to be reached.  </p>  <p>  A collaborative group including the Department of Health, HSE, NMBI and Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) representatives have met to explore solutions to facilitate adaptation and registration delays. Proposals were agreed which will now be implemented and should result in an improvement in the difficulties currently being experienced. </p>  <p>With regard to workforce planning, Action 46 of Future Health   (DoH, 2012) provides for the Department to work with the HSE to implement an effective approach to workforce planning and development with the objectives of: recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff; training and upskilling the workforce; providing for professional and career development; and creating supportive and healthy workplaces. </p>  <p>  In 2015, the Department of Health will develop a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning, on a cross-sectoral basis. A cross-sectoral Working Group will be convened to develop the framework in the near future. The Group's deliberations will take into account issues including population aging. Consultation with key stakeholders will form part of the Group's work.</p></reply>

All persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  Those charges are a per diem rate set out in the 2013 legislation and were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost, but they are not directly related to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals. </p>  <p>  The issue of hospital financing has been the subject of recent Departmental reports. In the case of public acute hospital care, a prospective, casemix-adjusted activity based system was recommended.  It has been recommended that the existing &lsquo;per diem&rsquo; charging regime for private activity in public hospitals be replaced by a case-based charge using DRGs.  Taking account of international evidence and of the detailed analysis already undertaken in the context of the above reports it was advised that the Programme for Government commitment on &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; should be realised through the introduction of a prospective Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) case-based payment system.  Since January, 2014 the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF - also known as Money Follows the Patient).  </p>  <p>  Activity Based Funding is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years.  The ABF approach is initially being applied to in-patient and day-case activity in public hospitals.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop policy proposals for the introduction of a case-based charging system for private patients in public hospitals.  However, it must be acknowledged that given the complexity and breadth of the issues to be examined and addressed, significant preparatory policy work must be undertaken.  This work must take full account of eligibility and legal issues, private income issues and the need for a sustainable mechanism for meeting the cost of private patients in public hospitals.  It would require substantial technical work and analysis on the financial impact on public hospitals. The focus for the short to medium term is on implementing ABF in the public system, as outlined in the recently launched HSE ABF Implementation Plan 2015 &ndash; 2017. Until this further work has been completed it will not be possible to present the Deputy with the figure requested.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;1.5 million has since been added by the HSE to the overall allocation making a total of &euro;13.5 million full year costs available to meet the needs of this cohort of young people. The HSE has assured me that Gheel Autism Services has recently been informed of their funding allocation to provide placements for 24 individuals from September.</p><p>The HSE is very aware of the challenges faced by some service providers and has been engaging locally and nationally with all providers, including Gheel Autism Services, who may not have the physical capacity within their existing services to accommodate the new intake of school leavers in 2015 but are actively seeking appropriate accommodation to enable a service to commence for these young people this year.  In this context, a further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding is to be allocated to organisations to provide suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.  The HSE has invited applications from all service providers to avail of this funding and capital allocations will be notified to providers in the coming days.  </p><p>The HSE will continue to work with Gheel Autism Services to resolve issues relating to accommodation.</p></reply>

Four consultant transplant surgeons remain and the renal transplant programme is continuing.  Given the limited number of surgeons who specialise in transplantation, the filling of any vacancies poses a challenge.  Every effort is currently being made to fill the two vacancies.</p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital is collaborating with St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in relation to a combined approach to kidney/pancreas transplants, as well as the development of an intra-abdominal organ retrieval service.  It is proposed that pancreatic transplants, of which 6 were performed in 2014, will move to St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital this year.  The two hospitals, together with the HSE and my Department, are working in partnership to make arrangements to facilitate the commencement of this work as soon as possible.  Most pancreas transplants are combined with a kidney transplant.  The arrangements being put in place for such cases will involve transplant surgeons from both St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together on the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus.</p>  <p>  In May Beaumont Hospital wrote to all patients who have received a pancreas transplant, as well as to patients who are on the transplant waiting list.  They have also written to all referring consultants.  At this point all pancreas transplant recipients have been seen by clinicians in Beaumont or have appointments in place.  At these appointments, future pathways of care are being discussed with all patients.</p>  <p>  A joint assessment clinic of potential pancreas transplant patients, involving consultants and nurses from both Beaumont and St. Vincent's, will be held on 24th July.</p></reply>

So far this year through the extreme spike in passport applications average turnaround times for passport express have remained at 10 or 11 days. Additionally approximately 250 customers are seen daily by appointment at our public counters in Dublin and Cork and receive a turnaround service of between 1 and 10 days as appropriate.</p>  <p>  This high level of service delivery has been achieved with the support of our staff in our passport offices in Dublin, Balbriggan and Cork.  To cope with the seasonal demand, the passport service recruited 160 additional temporary staff, most taken from the live register.  Additionally in line with the wider public service reform programme, the passport service pursues opportunities to improve customer service through an effective combination of internal and external service delivery initiatives.  One such example is our online tracker service, which is updated a number of times a day and gives the most up to date progress report on an application.</p>  <p>  Resource requirements are being kept under review in order to ensure that we can meet the growing demand for passport services, while at the same time modernising our processes and introducing new services such as the passport card for travel within EU and EEA countries.  It is envisaged that demand for the passport card will be high among young adults for age verification and consequently assist in reducing the number of lost passports.  The additional staffing resources required will be kept under regular review to ensure resources dedicated reflect actual demand.</p></reply>

My thoughts are with the family concerned.  I am aware also of the difficulties and frustrations faced, over a long period of time, by so many families bereaved by the conflict as they have sought to pursue truth and justice.  The Irish Government continues, in our ongoing bilateral relations and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, to raise with the British Government their Article 2 obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in relation to specific Troubles-related deaths.  Over 3,500 people died during the Troubles.  The suffering of their relatives and friends endures to this day.  I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases.  For that reason, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, remains a priority of the Government.</p>  <p>  These institutions will include a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths, as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval (ICIR) to enable families to seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths.</p>  <p>  In the Stormont House Agreement, it was acknowledged also that recent domestic and European judgments have demonstrated that the legacy inquest process in Northern Ireland is not providing access to a sufficiently effective investigation within an acceptable timeframe. In light of this, the NI Executive has undertaken to take appropriate steps to improve the way the legacy inquest function is conducted to comply with ECHR Article 2 requirements, which would encompass all cases in which there are allegations of collusion.  The Irish Government supports the full and expeditious implementation of the Stormont House Agreement including in relation to legacy inquests.</p></reply>

This measure took effect for all students, both new and renewal, from the start of the 2011/2012 academic year.</p>  <p>  The percentage split before the change in Budget 2011 was 77% of maintenance grant recipients qualifying for the non-adjacent rate with 23% of maintenance grants paid at the adjacent rate.  Currently the split is 53% non-adjacent and 47% adjacent.</p>  <p>  The percentage split between adjacent and non-adjacent can fluctuate from one year to another as some students graduate and new applicants come into grant. However, assuming that a change in the adjacency rate resulted in a reversion to the old percentage split then, approximately 15,000 additional students would move to the non-adjacent rate.  It is difficult to quantify the cost due to the fact that each individual's circumstances are different and any impact would affect an unknown cohort of new applicants applying to SUSI at some future date.  However, assuming that all 15,000 students transferring from the non-adjacent to the adjacent rate qualify for the standard rate of grant, then the financial impact of such a change would amount to &euro;27.1 million.  If all 15,000 qualified for the special rate then the cost would be &euro;52.8m.</p></reply>

Firstly, the applicant must be a "mature" student, i.e. he/she must be aged 23 or over on 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved course.  Secondly, because the majority of third level students move away from home to go to college and continue to be supported by their parents, grant applicants claiming mature independent status must demonstrate that, in addition to meeting the requirement as a "mature student", they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a period of time before commencing their studies.</p>  <p>  In practice, what this means is that an applicant entering college as a genuine mature student may, if also demonstrably self-supporting and living independently, be assessed for grant support on the basis of his/her own means and that of any spouse or partner, but independent of parental means.</p>  <p>  Setting out guidelines as to how students can demonstrate living independent will by their very nature, restrict the assessment of independent cases to those that fall within these guidelines.

A decision in Budget 2012 has meant that new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards are not entitled to maintenance payments under the Student Grant Scheme, but may qualify in some circumstances for limited fee support.</p><p>Those who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. </p><p>Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of their fees.  The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2015/16 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents.</p><p>Tax relief is available on postgraduate tuition fees.  Details in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>If the Budget 2012 decision was reversed and the income thresholds increased to bring them into line with those for undergraduate students, then the potential cost is estimated to be in the region of &euro;47m.  This costing assumes that the number of post-graduate grant holders will increase to the level prior to the introduction of this Budget measure.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, all proposals made in relation to education expenditure, including changes to postgraduate student grants, will be considered in the context of the Budget 2016.</p></reply>

Arthur Cox, Solicitors, were subsequently appointed to give advice on the approach to be taken.  Based on the advice received, CIT appointed independent consultants to review the allegations.  The consultants were instructed by Arthur Cox, in consultation with CIT's Audit Committee, regarding the terms for the review to be undertaken.  The cost to CIT of this  legal advice was &euro;34,181.73, with additional legal advice sought from O'Flynn Exhams Solrs. amounting to &euro;9,461.53.</p><p>Arthur Cox legal advisors issued tenders to four companies.  Tenders were received and the successful consultants were appointed on the basis of being the most competitive tender.  Given the nature of the allegations select members of staff liaised with the consultants carrying out the review and facilitated requests for information and documentation as required. The cost of the consultant's reports was &euro;21,175.</p><p>On the basis of concerns expressed by CIT that the publication of the reports could potentially damage the reputation of CIT and the individuals and organisations named in the reports, the Institute submitted redacted copies of the reports to my Department and the HEA.  In the interest of confidentiality CIT are reluctant to make public the names of the people who were consulted as part of the review process.</p><p>My Department has since sent a copy of the reports to the Public Accounts Committee who have been in correspondence with my Department in relation to the matter.  Sections 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 of the reports set out the scope of work undertaken by the consultants in conducting  the reviews.</p></reply>

Specifically, it has engaged with a number of community and voluntary training actors including AONTAS and the Community Education Network (CEN).</p><p>  QQI has now established a working group in partnership with the community and voluntary sector to enable a process of collaboration and engagement with key stakeholders and providers.  The working group, which is facilitated by an external Chair, had its first meeting on 3rd March 2015, and has subsequently met on 2 other occasions.  It has also jointly hosted a consultative event on QQI's quality assurance guidelines relevant to this sector which took place on 30th June 2015.  Through these joint initiatives, QQI and the community and voluntary sector are working together on a range of operational, developmental and strategic matters in the specific context of quality assurance and re-engagement.  The issue of fees will be informed by the work of the working group.</p></reply>

It is also being supported by the activities of the HEA-funded National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning&mdash;the key system-level infrastructure for the enhancement of teaching and learning in Irish higher education and for the implementation of the recommendations of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 in this area.  The HEA is monitoring higher education institutions' success in improving progression rates through the process of strategic dialogue.  As detailed in the Higher Education System Performance First Report 2014&ndash;2016, 'institutions with outlying progression rates have included targets to address these in their performance compacts to 2016, with at least half of the compacts containing a target in this regard'. </p><p>The HEA's studies on student progression, along with the qualitative data generated through the Irish Survey of Student Engagement (ISSE), enhance the evidence-base for the development of policy and practice to tackle non-progression amongst students in higher education.</p></reply>

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed.</p><p>  A study on &quot;The Prevalence and Impact of Bullying Linked to Social Media on the Mental Health and Suicidal Behaviour among Young People&quot;, which was commissioned by my Department and the National Office for Suicide Prevention, was published in May 2014.  The review notes that as cyberbullying appears to be closely tied to traditional bullying, it is likely that already established anti-bullying interventions will also impact on cyberbullying and that entirely new programmes are not necessary.  Therefore, the implementation of the Plan will continue.  A key element of its implementation is the anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools which were published at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year.</p><p>  These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  They place a strong focus on education and prevention strategies to deal with bullying behaviour including, in particular, cyberbullying and identity based bullying such as homophobic and transphobic bullying.  The procedures make clear that the focus of any prevention and education awareness measures in schools about cyber-bullying should be on educating pupils on how to stay safe while on-line and also on developing a culture of reporting any concerns about cyber-bullying.  The procedures also recognise that parents and pupils have a role and responsibility in helping the school to prevent and address school-based bullying behaviour and to deal with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere.</p><p>  A very important element of the new procedures to help ensure greater transparency for parents and pupils is the requirement for schools to publish their anti-bullying policy on the school's website and to provide it to the parents association.  The procedures also include important new oversight arrangements that involve the School Principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation.  Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents association and published on the school website.</p><p>  In addition, my Department's Inspectorate, as part of its inspection work, is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying.</p></reply>

In 2015 the capitation grant is &euro;170 per pupil and the ancillary services grant is &euro;147 per pupil.</p><p>  Where a school uses capitation and ancillary grant funding to employ administrative staff, such staff are employees of the individual schools.

The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support.</p><p>  Circular 0042/2011 provides information to schools regarding the staffing arrangements which apply in Special schools.  The Circular sets out that special schools are staffed based on their pupil profiles and the disability category of the pupils enrolled, as opposed to being based principally on school designation.  Staffing levels therefore reflect the complexity of need that exist within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, as many Special schools enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.</p><p>  In determining the staffing allocation for schools, the NCSE takes into account up-to-date enrolment and pupil profile information.  School staffing schedules are reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE.As such, the profile of Special school pupil populations are aligned with appropriate staffing allocations.  Accordingly, the staffing allocation for the school referred to in the Deputy's question reflects the profile of pupils currently enrolled in the school, in accordance with each pupil's disability categorisation.</p><p>  The NCSE has published the staffing allocations for Special schools for 2015/16, including the school referred to by the Deputy, on its website <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p></reply>

The appeal procedures are also set out in the published staffing arrangements.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth.

It is not a compensation scheme and Section 14(8) of the Act explicitly provides that homeowners cannot seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken outside of the pyrite remediation scheme.  I have no plans to amend the legislation in this regard.   </p>  <p>  The Pyrite Remediation Scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress.  Inclusion in the scheme is predicated, inter alia, on the dwelling being subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, and where this can be verified having regard to I.S. 398 -1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and Categorisation, as published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, prior to works commencing.  This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement for inclusion in a scheme.   </p>  <p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the supplier and-or their respective insurers.  In the event that the parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation, the option of seeking redress in the Courts is available.   </p></reply>

Section 10 of the Act further places a specific obligation on local authorities to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.  Local authorities have substantial powers under the Act, including powers to establish a register of derelict sites in their functional areas; requiring owners or occupiers of sites to take specific measures which the authority considers necessary to address the dereliction within specified timeframes; to acquire a site by agreement or compulsorily in certain circumstances; and to impose an annual derelict sites levy at a rate of 3% of the market value of a site on registered sites in urban areas or other areas prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to be an urban area for the purposes of the Act.   </p>  <p>  The administration and implementation of the Act at a local level is a matter for the respective local authorities.

Rents for houses were 6.5% higher, while apartment rents were 7.8% higher than in the same quarter of 2014. </p>  <p>  These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market.  Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q1 2015, rents were higher by 9.6% in Dublin (with house rents up by 9% and apartment rents higher by 10.8%).  Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued.  In the 12 months to the end of Q1 2015, rents were higher by 5.3% (with house rents up by 5.7% and apartment rents higher by 5.2%).   </p>  <p>  A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts.  Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed.  Construction 2020 also commits to identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development.   </p>  <p>  Addressing the supply shortfall in housing will take time but in the period since the publication of Construction 2020 some welcome signs of recovery in the sector have become evident.  Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  The latest figures for new house completions show that 4,566 units were completed to the end of May 2015, up almost 16% on the corresponding figure for 2014.   </p>  <p>  Social housing is a key priority for the Government, evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in Budget 2015 and the publication of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 in November 2014.  The total targeted provision under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and 75,000 units through the private rented sector supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).</p>  <p>  There has been a number of relevant publications in recent times with suggestions and options in relation to rent certainty, notably the report produced for the PRTB by DKM Economic Consultants, Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector and the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) report Ireland&rsquo;s Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply.  Stakeholders representing landlords and tenants have also been vocal on this topic.   </p>  <p>  The regulation of rent raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike.  Ultimately, any decision in relation to rent certainty is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring proposals to Government for consideration as soon as the necessary preparatory work has been completed.</p></reply>

Accordingly, there are several legacy licensed and unlicensed landfill sites that have required remediation since the judgment and some others that have arisen in the interim which must be remediated in the course of the next few years for environmental, reputational and economic reasons. </p><p>Full details of the programme of measures which Ireland has agreed to deliver to ensure full compliance with the judgment, including the costs incurred to December 2014 by the State, are set out in a detailed document available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i>www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Environment/Waste/FileDownLoad,30458,en.pdf</i>.</p></reply>

These draft revisions proposed the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments; a mandatory minimum setback distance of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations; and the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. </p><p>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process.  It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.  In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines.  Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines. </p><p>  The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process.  55 applications were approved for funding totalling approximately &euro;8 million for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.  A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on that occasion.</p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4 million would be allocated for a twelve month period to thirty-two previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. </p><p>On 25 May 2015, I announced that funding will be provided from 1 July this year to 30 June 2016 following a review in relation to the impact of the cessation of their current funding on 30 June 2015.  This funding is being provided to thirty of the thirty-two organisations previously in receipt of bridging funding, including all health and disability organisations.  This further support will be based on current levels of funding to the organisations in question and is being provided through a Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations (DSSNO).  The funding, totalling &euro;1.32 million, to be provided to each organisation is set out in the following table, and each organisation is allocated the same amount of funding over the 12 months from 1 July 2015 under DSSNO as provided in the 12 months to 30 June 2015 under bridging funding.  This includes the Irish Stammering Association who will receive funding of &euro;24,868.</p><p>It is envisaged that the new Scheme to Support National Organisations will be advertised in early 2016 and groups funded under the 2014-2016 Scheme to Support National Organisations and the recently announced Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations will be required to apply for funding under the single SSNO Scheme and meet the criteria required for funding. <table><tr><th>Funding allocated under Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016 </th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland </td><td>53,882 </td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td>19,066 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td>33,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td>70,462 </td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities </td><td>45,592 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Approved Housing Body (AHB) Mortgage to Rent Scheme is now properly established as part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the arrears resolution process.</p><p>My Department has been involved in ongoing discussions with Approved Housing Bodies, Financial Institutions and the Housing Agency regarding the operation and progress on the AHB Mortgage to Rent Scheme since its inception.  These discussions form part of an ongoing process of engagement with relevant stakeholders to remove any obstacles that may arise in the implementation of the scheme.  To try to deal with some of the issues that have arisen and which can delay the process, a protocol between all stakeholders was agreed and came into operation in June 2014.  Under this process, the borrower is involved from the outset and is requested to give their consent to the sharing of their full information at the start of the process.  This ensures that there is no ambiguity for borrowers in the mortgage to rent process. </p><p>In addition, the package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government recently includes a number of amendments to the AHB Mortgage to Rent Scheme, which will enable more properties to qualify for the scheme and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  The principal amendment to the scheme is to increase the valuation thresholds applicable which should enable more properties to qualify.  These amendments apply across the country regardless of the location of the property  and took effect from 1 July. </p><p>Since the scheme began in June 2012 to end June 2015, 104 AHB mortgage to rent transactions have negotiations completed.  In total, 2,922 cases have been put forward for the scheme by lending institutions, of which 2,107 cases were deemed ineligible or terminated during the process.  Agreement on the sale could not be agreed on a further 45 cases.  Some reasons for transactions not progressing include ineligible applications, including the borrower not meeting the criteria of the scheme, the borrower declining the scheme, the lender withdrawing the offer of the scheme, the local authority not having a need for the property or the over concentration of social housing in the area.  At the end of June 2015, 111 cases were with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation.  The remaining 555 cases are actively being progressed.  The following table sets out the completed cases by local authority.<table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>MTR Transactions Completed (June 2015) </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td>17 </td></tr><tr><td>Dunlaoghaire Rathdown County Council </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City and County Council </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td>10 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council </td><td>8 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council </td><td>8 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council </td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total </td><td>104 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

My Department's role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.    </p>  <p>  In 2014, local authorities adopted the fourth round of Traveller Accommodation Programmes in 2014, with the five-year rolling accommodation programmes running from 2014 to 2018.  These programmes provide a roadmap for local authority investment priorities over the period.  They also form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for traveller accommodation, on foot of proposals received from local authorities and subject to approval from my Department. </p>  <p>  2015 capital allocations in respect of Traveller specific accommodation have issued to local authorities.  The bulk of the funding was allocated in respect of schemes already under construction, new schemes approved to commence construction in 2015 and to meet final balances on completed schemes.  The balance of funding is towards projects that will be newly approved during 2015.  As Galway City Council had no schemes either under construction or approved to commence construction in 2015, and had no final balances due, they did not receive an allocation this year.     </p>  <p>  In March 2015, as part of the allocation process, Galway City Council submitted a list of indicative proposals that they hope to progress in the coming years, in line with their Traveller Accommodation Programme 2014 to 2018.  Detailed proposals, when received, will be examined by my Department.  Subsequent to the 2015 allocation process, on 8 May 2015, Galway City Council submitted a post-tender report and documentation to my Department in relation to the demolition, rebuilding and refurbishment of two houses at Ballinfoyle Park, following extensive fire damage to the houses.  My Department is in communication with the Council in relation to this proposal.</p></reply>

Under planning legislation, the change of use of any premises to a takeaway or fast food outlet would require planning permission. In deciding whether or not to grant permission for a development, the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant ministerial or Government policies including any guidelines issued by my Department.</p>  <p>  Local Area Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities were published in June 2013.  The Guidelines recognise the important role of planning in promoting and facilitating active and healthy living patterns for local communities.  For example, the Guidelines suggest that the local area plan can promote active and healthier lifestyles by ensuring that, inter alia, exposure of children to the promotion of foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar is reduced through careful consideration of the appropriateness or location of fast food outlets in the vicinity of schools and parks.   </p>  <p>I consider these measures are an appropriate approach; therefore, I have no current plans to make specific regulations in this regard.</p></reply>

In the period since 2007, there has been a significant increase in the number of households with access to the internet at home.  National data from CSO indicates that 82% of households in 2014 use the internet at home, compared to 57% in 2007.  Innovative advances in technology also means that portable computers (netbooks and tablets) along with smartphones, have overtaken the use of home computers, and are widely available in a highly competitive market.</p><p>With all households now having access to basic broadband and a high proportion having an internet subscription, my Department is focussed on delivering high speed broadband access, through the National Broadband Plan, and driving digital adoption through the National Digital Strategy.  The strategy aims to position Ireland to take advantage of the opportunities of digital by getting more businesses trading online, more citizens online, and enhancing the use of ICT in the school environment.</p><p>According to the CSO, the main reasons stated for not having a household internet connection was<i>Not needed</i>(42%) and <i>Lack of skills </i>(39%).  My Department&rsquo;s Bene<i>f</i>IT programme is a key initiative under the National Digital Strategy to raise awareness and increase digital skills among citizens.  It works in partnership with community voluntary and not-for-profit organisations to provide digital skills training to citizens in more than 700 locations right across the country.  The combined efforts of my Department, its partners and other stakeholders are paying dividends with CSO statistics published in December 2014 showing the number of people who have never used the internet now reduced to 1 in 6. </p><p>I will arrange for my officials to forward the Deputy a copy of the National Digital Strategy.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network. </p>  <p>  In 2006, the CER approved a Gas Connections Policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting new towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied. </p>  <p>  The policy provides that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges.  The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline. The anticipated industrial or commercial gas usage in the town largely determines the revenue from gas network charges which must balance the connection costs.  Uneconomic gas pipeline projects would unfairly increase energy costs for all gas consumers. </p>  <p>  Under the 2006 network connections policy Gaslink has completed three comprehensive studies to assess nearly 80 towns for connections to the gas network with the result that more than twenty new towns have been connected in recent years.  Towns connected in the North West Region, seven in total, include: Ballina, Ballinrobe, Castlebar, Claremorris, Crossmolina and Westport in Co. Mayo and Cootehill in Co. Cavan. </p>  <p>  As the successor to Gaslink, Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection in 2010 as well as other towns.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p>  <p>  The CER recently hosted a consultation on a submission received by it from GNI proposing revisions to the existing gas connections policy, as mentioned above.  The consultation period has now ended and a decision is expected shortly.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are delivering or plan to deliver high speed broadband services.  The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas for the State intervention. </p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators, 99% of the townland of Kiltimagh will be covered by the commercial sector while the remaining 1% will be part of the State intervention.  I would add that details of investment roll-out programmes by commercial operators are publicly available on their websites.</p><p>Members of the public should consult the map to establish for themselves the precise location and status of their individual premises.</p><p>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.</p><p>More generally I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over 17,000 premises to date in Co Mayo with over 15,000 more expected to be served by commercial investment.  The remaining 51,000 premises in Mayo will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention. </p><p>The Department has recently received updated information from operators in respect of further commercial rollout of high speed services.  The Department is now reviewing all of the data provided by operators for 2016 - 2020 with a view to validating and updating commercial coverage plans and revising the map as appropriate. </p><p>In the meantime, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area.  Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. </p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected. </p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in Ireland.</p></reply>

Under EUROSTAT rules, the proceeds arising from the sale of the State's shares in Aer Lingus represent the sale of a financial asset and will have no beneficial impact on Ireland's general Government balance, GGB.  Accordingly, the money received will not provide any capacity for additional Government expenditure on a GGB-neutral basis.  It is for this reason the proceeds will be allocated to this special fund, which will operate on a commercial basis. As regards the reopening of Dunleer railway station, under the current capital plan the focus of Exchequer funding available for heavy rail is on protecting existing assets and maintaining safety standards.  There is no Exchequer funding available for the re-opening of train stations such as Dunleer.  Moreover, CIE is in a difficult financial position and it has no resources of its own to fund new stations.  If additional funds become available under the next capital plan there will be many competing projects from all transport modes in all regions.  Any additional funds will be prioritised for projects for which there is a clear need, which are affordable, have a sound business case and add value to existing infrastructure.</p></reply>

The Council sought that provision be made through primary legislation to regulate the operation of rickshaws. As it is a requirement that a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) be prepared in respect of any proposal to Government seeking permission to regulate through primary legislation, and given that rickshaws are a local matter, I have responded to the Council that it would be appropriate that the Council  prepare a RIA.  The purpose of the RIA is to establish more clearly the issues that need to be addressed and the kind of regulatory initiative that is most appropriate to deal with those issues.  The RIA would include, amongst other things, an assessment of the measures that could be adopted within the existing bye-law making powers of local authorities and also help determine whether any proposal for primary legislation should be dealt with as a matter of road traffic legislation or local government legislation.</p></reply>

However I am aware that the accounts of the FAI are subject to audit in the normal way.  I understand that the Financial Statements for each of the years from 2010 to 2014 have been audited by a registered independent auditor in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and standards on auditing.  I understand that the auditor's reports confirmed the accuracy of the annual accounts.</p>  <p>  The transaction between FIFA and the FAI was between two private organisations and did not involve any taxpayers money.  There was no requirement on the FAI to report it to me or to any of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department.  I welcome the publication by the FAI of the documentation relating to the transaction.  I believe that issues in relation to governance and in relation to how this transaction occurred were supported and dealt with in the documentation that has been published.</p></reply>

Any vehicles that are powered other than by human effort do fall subject to insurance requirements.</p><p>Dublin City Council has written to me regarding the need to regulate rickshaws from a number of perspectives but primarily health and safety on the basis that the type and extent of regulation proposed would appear to go beyond what a local authority would usually wish to regulate by bye-laws under the Local Government Act 2001.  The Council sought that provision be made through primary legislation to regulate the operation of rickshaws.  As it is a requirement that a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) be prepared in respect of any proposal to Government seeking permission to regulate through primary legislation, and given that rickshaws are a local matter, I have responded to the Council that it would be appropriate that the Council  prepare a RIA.  The purpose of the RIA is to establish more clearly the issues that need to be addressed and the kind of regulatory initiative that is most appropriate to deal with those issues.  The RIA would include, amongst other things, an assessment of the measures that could be adopted within the existing bye-law making powers of local authorities and also help determine whether any proposal for primary legislation should be dealt with as a matter of road traffic legislation or local government legislation.</p><p>  Any questions about progress in that regard might be directed to the Council.</p></reply>

The Company was immediately informed of its statutory requirements as regards the establishment of subsidiaries. </p>  <p>  The Company replied that, while the entity proposed was a new company, it was not a subsidiary as defined within the Harbours Acts and therefore the requirement for Ministerial consent did not exist. </p>  <p>  Regardless of legal technicalities as regards the status of the Trust, my Department has been consistently clear that the Company should seek Ministerial consent and noted that the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies also requires Ministerial consent in respect of any intended action which would extend or change significantly the nature, scope or scale of the activities in which it engages.</p>  <p>  A Company proposal to utilise the AGM in 2012 as a mechanism to gain Ministerial consent was rejected by officials as being procedurally incorrect.</p>  <p>  The Department required the Company to ensure that the Trust remained non trading and without share capital until such as time as the proper consents had been secured.</p>  <p>  In July 2014, my predecessor wrote to the Company to highlight his concerns at the approach adopted by it with regard to meeting the corporate governance standards expected of State bodies.  In November 2014, I met with, and subsequently wrote to, the Company and during these exchanges again raised the issue of Ministerial consent in respect of the diaspora project. </p>  <p>  The amounts referred to by the Deputy for 2012 and 2013 relate to expenditure incurred in the development of the diaspora prototype, and as of 31 December 2014, there were no outstanding balances due from the Irish International Diaspora Centre Trust to Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company.  The Company has informed me that the entity known as The Irish International Diaspora Centre Trust is being wound up.   </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the directors referred to in the Deputy's question were appointed to the Board of the Irish International Diaspora Centre Trust on 28 November 2011.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware the five Ports of Regional Significance are Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow.</p><p>The Bill is designed to provide maximum legislative flexibility.

Retention of the existing company structure and a transfer of the Ministerial shareholding in the company; or</p><p>2. Dissolution of the existing company structure and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into local authority structures.</p><p>Where the company structure is retained and the shareholding of that company transferred to the local authority, then the Bill provides for the amendment of the existing Harbours Acts to reflect that transfer. </p><p>Obviously, under this type of transfer there is a need to ensure the appropriate balance between the freedom and requirements of a commercial port and Council oversight.  The Bill specifies the differing roles of the Executive and the elected members of a Council in this type of arrangement.  As an example, section 23 requires Chairpersons and CEOs to appear before the elected members to give account of their administration of that company, if invited to appear by the elected members.</p><p>Obviously under the other method of transfer, the company is dissolved and the port will be administered as a functional area of a local authority.</p></reply>

As committed to within National Ports Policy I issued a response to the Authority's six recommendations and that response is available to view on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The issue of stevedore licensing was examined by the Authority and formed the basis for one of the six recommendations.  The Authority recommended that general stevedore licenses be granted to applicants on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis or through a tendering basis.  The report also stated that where stevedoring services are provided exclusively by a port authority stevedore, this requirement should be clearly justified by the relevant port authorities. </p>  <p>  As acknowledged in that report, our ports operate a number of different methods as regards the organisation of stevedoring within their port estate.  Some do not provide any stevedoring services whatsoever but instead license  private operators.  Other ports provide stevedoring services through subsidiary companies in competition with private sector parties while others provide stevedoring exclusively through a subsidiary company.</p>  <p>  The issue of competition in our port services market is extremely important and any particular concerns on any competition issue should be brought to the attention of the Competition Authority, which has the required statutory powers to enforce competition law. </p>  <p>  At a European level there is currently a Port Services Regulation under consideration at the European Parliament, which proposes to address the issue of port services competition generally.</p></reply>

While my Department provides funding to the national cultural institutions, including the National Library, the management and board of each institution are responsible for all operational matters and for determining spending priorities, based on the resources available to them.</p>  <p>  The decision to publish online images from the Catholic Parish Register microfilms was taken by the Board and management of the National Library.  The launch of the new resource on 8 July will be the culmination of  over 3 years of digitisation work by the Library.  </p>  <p>  The National Library has indicated that the primary purpose of the current project is to improve access to these records for people abroad, as well as Irish citizens, by making them available online.  A secondary consideration is the preservation of the records. I am advised that, at present, the microfilms records in the Library have to be handled in the reading room and placed in a microfiche machine to enable users to examine the records.  Placing them online will help prevent further damage to the records and will also reduce the resources required by the Library in the reading room to facilitate the large numbers of users who wish to view the parish records. </p>  <p>  I understand that the National Library holds only Catholic Parish Registers in its collection and not the church records of any other religious denomination.   </p>  <p>  I understand also from the Library that the images are being published under a non-commercial reuse licence.  This precludes any organisation from using the images for commercial purposes.</p>  <p>  This new digital resource will help people at home and abroad who are interested in tracing their ancestry.  The website provides access to church records dating back up to 270 years and includes details like the dates of baptisms and marriages, and the names of the key people involved.  The records feature the baptisms of some very well known historical figures, such as the 1916 Leaders, Padraig Pearse and Thomas McDonagh.</p>  <p>  Making this kind of material available online should help to boost genealogy tourism, and will complement the work of local historical centres in communities around the country.  As we approach the centenary of the 1916 Rising next year, I am keen to make as much historical material as possible available online, so we can encourage people around the world to reconnect with their Irish roots.</p></reply>

The species in question are largely dependent upon low-productivity grazing areas in uplands and bogs, and their reduced numbers reflect long-term changes in land use in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, agriculture.  Land uses such as turf-cutting and afforestation over many decades are also very significant.  It is essential to include, in considerations of this topic, the fundamental need of landowners to secure a viable living for themselves and their families in rural areas.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department continues to work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and other relevant Departments and agencies, to secure the conservation of these species, while seeking the means to support continued sustainable farming.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of section 16 of the Act, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht forms the intention to designate a natural heritage area, while the making of a natural heritage area order is carried out under the provisions of section 18.</p><p>Natural heritage areas are legally protected from damage from the date they are formally proposed for designation through a requirement to obtain my consent, as Minister, before certain potentially damaging activities are undertaken on the sites. </p><p>75 raised bogs, which are located mainly in the midlands, have been given legal protection as natural heritage areas, covering some 23,000 hectares.  A further 73 blanket bogs, covering 37,000 hectares, mostly in western areas, are also designated as natural heritage areas. </p><p>While some natural heritage areas exist entirely or partly within candidate special areas of conservation or special protection areas, my Department estimates that some 45,873 hectares of land is solely designated within natural heritage areas.</p><p>In addition, there are 630 proposed natural heritage areas.  While a review of these sites is foreseen, this will not take place in the immediate future, having regard to the available resources.</p><p>There have been no natural heritage areas de-designated in the last ten years. </p><p>In January 2014, the <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network </i>was<i></i>published and concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.</p><p>46 natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 natural heritage areas) are scheduled for de-designation.  To compensate for the loss of habitat within these sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can continue, 25 undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, will be designated as natural heritage areas.  Compensation will be made available to affected turf cutters.</p><p>Regulatory change will be required to give full effect to the de-designation of the sites.  The appropriate form of this change is being considered within my Department and I expect that the process will be completed by the end of the year.</p></reply>
