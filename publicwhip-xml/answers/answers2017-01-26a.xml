    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-26a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012600052#WRA00600"><p>Public Procurement is governed by the EU Treaty, EU Directives, Regulations and national guidelines.  These set down rules whereby contracting authorities must award contracts under procedures designed to achieve value for public money in an open, transparent and non discriminatory competitive process. </p>  <p>  The appropriateness of including sustainability clauses in public procurement projects will vary from contract to contract and is a matter for individual contracting authorities.  Comprehensive guidance is available to public authorities assist them in this regard in the "Action Plan on Green Public Procurement", published in 2012, and "Green Procurement Guidance for the Public Sector", published in 2014.  These documents identify eight priority areas of procurement activity which are most suitable for inclusion of sustainability clauses including; construction; energy; transport; food and catering services; cleaning products and services; paper; clothing and textiles; information and communications technology.  Core criteria and comprehensive criteria are identified across the priority areas for use throughout the procurement process from specification, through to selection and award stages, and through to the contract management stage.    </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, new EU Directives on Procurement were transposed into Irish Law in May of 2016 and these also provide greater scope and legal clarity in relation to the use of sustainability clauses, including for example on the use of life-cycle costing.  The recently published framework for rapid housing for Fingal County Council for example included a provision for whole life costs in the design solutions and proposed a range of sustainability measures including renewable technologies.</p>  <p>  Reform of the public procurement function is, and remains, driven by the need to obtain maximum value for public money in procuring works, supplies and services.  However, the Government recognises that public procurement provides an important mechanism for moving the market in favour of the provision of more eco-efficient, less environmentally-harmful goods and services.  The Irish public sector needs to play an exemplary role in promoting environmental measures throughout its spending.  This can also be a driver for innovation and competitiveness in the industrial sector as it promotes the development of new technologies and can provide a competitive advantage for emerging companies in the SME sector.</p></reply>

Terms and conditions of employment for public servants are also set by reference to legislation including the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts and through negotiation and agreement under collective agreements such as the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) and the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA). </p>  <p>  The issue of addressing the difference in incremental salary scales between those public servants, who entered public service employment since 2011 and those who entered before that date was addressed with the relevant union interests under the provisions of the Haddington Road Agreement. </p>  <p>  Flexibility provided for within the LRA has allowed particular sectoral issues to be addressed such as the restoration of supervision and substitution payments and new entrant payments in the Education Sector and the restoration of rent allowances to new entrant firefighters and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this shows the potential of a collective approach in dealing successfully with such issues.</p></reply>

This co-operation is part of our respective implementation of the EU Floods Directive and therefore the Erne Catchment in both Ireland and Northern Ireland has been fully assessed as part of the CFRAM Study.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Erne Catchment system in County Cavan; CFRAM&rsquo;s Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) study, carried out in 2011, identified Cavan Town and Ballyconnell as Areas of Further Assessment (AFA) and are being assessed as part of the North Western-Neagh Bann CFRAM Study. In the AFA of Cavan Town there are structural options proposed in the draft Flood Risk Management Plan.  In the AFA of Ballyconnell, the detailed CFRAM analysis has determined that there is currently a very low level of flood risk from rivers and/or the sea in this area.</p>  <p>  Those parts of the Erne Catchment which affect these AFAs have been modelled, mapped and assessed for options to manage flood risk.  Public consultation events were held in Spring 2015 on the draft flood maps, in Spring 2016 on the preliminary options and Autumn 2016 on the draft plans.</p>  <p>  Following this public consultation process, the draft plans are being finalised taking on board the comments received.  The finalised plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, that can address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Among the feasible measures that may form part of a flood defence scheme, as part of the implementation of the FRMPs will be; structural defences built through the OPW&rsquo;s Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995; Local Authorities own powers; and/or the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. </p>  <p>  The OPW is on track to finalise the Flood Risk Management Plans, in Spring 2017, for approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Coastal erosion may threaten human life, infrastructure such as roads, and may undermine and cause damage to properties.  However, it should also be recognised that coastal erosion also has beneficial effects to the local environment, such as providing natural nourishment and supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.</p><p>The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.</p><p>The OPW has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website. The relevant reports and associated predictive erosion hazard mapping (to 2050) may be viewed<font color="#5291EF"> </font></p><p>This Study has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.</p><p>The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources.  If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.</p><p>Because intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. </p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for measures costing up to &euro;500,000 in each instance.

The policy with regard to non-operational (vacant) State properties and sites including former Garda stations is to:</p>  <p>  1. Identify if the property is required/suitable for alternative State use by Government departments or the wider public sector.</p>  <p>  2. If there is no other State use identified for a property, the OPW will then consider disposing of the property on the open market if and when conditions prevail, in order to generate revenue for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  3. If no State requirement is identified or if a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property the OPW may consider community involvement subject to detailed written submission which would indicate that the community/voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property and that there are no ongoing costs for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The Commissioners of Public Works have engaged with key Local Authority stakeholders to ensure that property is not disposed of when it might be deemed suitable for alternative use such as to address the needs of homeless persons.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) is currently in discussion with local authorities in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Tipperary and Kilkenny regarding properties that might be suitable for housing or emergency accommodation.  The Office also has ongoing discussions with the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust regarding its needs.</p>  <p>  The majority of the properties currently listed as vacant are closed Garda stations that are located in rural areas and would require significant investment and adaptation to suit the needs of homeless individuals and families.  Many of these properties are not suited for such adaption.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that when the OPW does dispose of any properties on the open market the receipts from those transactions are returned to the central exchequer thus enabling the funds to be used for social housing or related projects as deemed appropriate.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. </p><p>The EU Procurement Directives, transposed into Irish law in May 2016, are intended to make it easier for SMEs to tender for public procurement contracts.  Specific measures aimed at facilitating SME participation include the following:</p><p>- there is explicit provision for prior discussion with suppliers and independent experts, with safeguards against distorting competition or violating transparency and non-discrimination principles;</p><p>- financial capacity criterion is less demanding and generally limited to twice the contract value;</p><p>- there is discretion to divide public contracts into lots;</p><p>- there is a provision for &quot;consortia bidding&quot; to encourage SME involvement; and</p><p>- there are reductions in the time limits for receipt of tenders;</p><p>The Government had accelerated a number of these measures into policy in Ireland by way of Circular 10/14, which issued in April 2014.</p><p>My colleague, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy, chairs an SME Advisory Group which meets quarterly and seeks to enhance the measures already in place to support SME access.  This group comprises of SME industry representative bodies (IBEC, ISME, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland (EI).  </p><p>Some of the measures aimed at facilitating SME access to public procurement include events organised by InterTrade Ireland and supported by the OGP and EI.  In 2016, for example, there were thirteen &quot;Go-2-Tender&quot; workshops attended by 179 businesses.  There were also two &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events, in Belfast in June and a new Regional/Opportunity driven approach was piloted in Cork in October, attended by over 900 businesses and buyers from across the public sector, North and South.  Similar events are planned for 2017.  </p><p>In conclusion, the reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

These AFAs have been modelled, mapped and assessed for options to manage flood risk.  Public consultation events were held in Spring 2015 on the draft flood maps, in Spring 2016 on the preliminary options and Autumn 2016 on the draft plans.</p>  <p>  Following this public consultation process, the draft plans are being finalised taking on board the comments received.  The finalised plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, that can address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Amongst the feasible measures that may form part of a flood defence scheme, as part of the implementation of the FRMPs will be; structural defences built through the OPW&rsquo;s Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995; Local Authorities own powers; and/or the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  The plans, when finalised in Spring 2017, will be sent to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in September 2015 announced details of a &euro;430 million 6 year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall Capital Investment Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021.  During this time, the annual allocation for flood defence schemes will more than double to &euro;100m. </p>  <p>  The flood protection capital programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 will build on the very significant investment that has already been undertaken in flood relief works throughout the country over the last 20 years.  It will provide the means to provide feasible protection to homes and businesses in major urban areas together with investment in many minor works projects to address more localised flooding problems. </p>  <p>  In August 2016, I contacted the CEOs of all local authorities to acknowledge the significant work of and contribution made by the City and County Councils in addressing flooding problems throughout the country.  In addition, I also reminded the local authorities of the availability of the Minor Works Scheme and to make the best possible use of the scheme to deal with localised fluvial and coastal flooding problems that may be eligible for funding under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;500,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a minimum cost benefit ratio of 1.5:1.</p>  <p>  On a national level, close on &euro;38m has been approved for over 600 projects since the scheme was introduced in 2009, with over 400 projects already completed providing protection to 5,000 properties.</p></reply>

It is solutions focused and designed to deliver the highest level of efficiencies to add value to the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p>  <p>  The Group, which is chaired by the OPW, has taken a decision to develop a plan for strategic maintenance works on the River Shannon.  Over the years there have been many calls for a maintenance programme to be put in place for the Shannon.  A planned maintenance programme to halt the deterioration of the River Shannon would complement the Group&rsquo;s existing Work Programme and the specific measures that are identified for the areas at risk in the Draft Shannon Flood Risk Management Plan. </p>  <p>  In order to progress work on this initiative, significant background work must be undertaken to firstly look at all of the issues associated with such a proposal and then to develop a project plan to bring the initiative forward.</p>  <p>  A sub-committee of the Group is currently being established to review and assess all the issues involved including financial, environmental and legal issues.  The sub-committee will determine the scope of the project as part of their deliberations including the potential targeting and phasing of works.  The resources required will evolve as the various strands of the project are identified, reviewed, assessed and ultimately agreed on.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that there are a range of activities that can be considered when carrying out river channel maintenance, of which dredging is only one such potential activity.  The maintenance required may involve work on the river bed or the river bank and may range from the removal of silt deposits to the cutting back of vegetation.  The sub-committee will consider the full range of activities as part of their deliberations.</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.</p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to actually protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December 2016. When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas. The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it takes for the Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement of the Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Committee Stage amendments, and of the the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p></reply>

This comprises growth in average pay of 2.7 per cent and employment growth of 2.1 per cent.  Pay bill growth is projected to average 5.4 per cent per annum in each year thereafter, with average pay expected to grow at just over 3 per cent per annum.  This outlook is consistent with the industrial relations commitments made under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p><p>To the extent that wage pressures exceed these projections, this could be expected to boost consumption and overall price levels in the near term.  However, to the extent that such higher pay rates result in a loss of competitiveness, any positive impact will be offset by lower overall economic activity and lower numbers employed.</p><p>Work published previously by my Department titled 'Quantification of the economic impacts of selected structural reform in Ireland', (<i></i>) indicates that a 1 percentage point wage shock which is not offset by a corresponding rise in productivity, could be expected to reduce the level of real output (GDP) by 1/4 percentage point (pp) within 7 years, add 1pp to the rate of unemployment, and reduce the number of people employed by some 0.4 percentage points.</p><p>Given downside risks within the international context, it is imperative that wage developments should be commensurate with trends in productivity (output per person employed) over the coming years, in order to avoid a deterioration in Ireland's competitiveness.</p><p>May I remind the Deputy that public sector pay is primarily a matter for the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Work was carried out in my Department to assess the potential economic implications arising, including through the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme study published in November 2015 titled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'. </p>  <p>  Since the referendum, my Department has been closely monitoring developments at both the macro and sectoral level.  Early macroeconomic indicators suggest that the immediate impact from the UK decision is more muted then initially anticipated.  In particular, third quarter national accounts data provide clear evidence of continued momentum in the economy with GDP increasing by 6.9 per cent year-on-year. </p>  <p>  In relation to the public finances, the recent end-year Exchequer data would also indicate that we remain on course to record a deficit of 0.9 per cent of GDP for 2016.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that the impact of the UK decision is likely to materialise with a lag.  As a result, my Department lowered its Budget 2017 GDP growth forecast for this year by approximately &frac12; percentage point reflecting the outcome of the referendum.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor developments and will publish updated macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts as part of the Stability Programme Update, in April this year.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy.  This showed that the sectors most impacted by Brexit are generally small scale indigenous enterprises, with high levels of regional employment, relatively low profit levels, that are highly linked to the rest of the economy. In terms of indigenous sectors Food and Beverage and Traditional Manufacturing are highly dependent on the UK both as a source of exports and for overall turnover. </p>  <p>  Ireland's exposure to the UK is not isolated to the indigenous sectors, with, for example, pharmaceutical manufacturing, financial and ICT services having a substantial export relationship with the UK. Certain other services sectors such as the indigenous Tourism and Hospitality sector (which is heavily dependent on UK tourists) will be equally exposed to the competitiveness challenges posed by the recent appreciation of the euro-sterling bilateral rate. </p>  <p>  On the basis of all the analysis a number of measures were announced in Budget 2017 with a view to making Ireland Brexit ready. </p>  <p>  It is important to stress that the best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds. </p>  <p>  In this context, Budget 2017 signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide an additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including the impact of Brexit.  This will complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund to be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 which will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer.</p></reply>

I introduced these changes in order to close off certain tax-planning opportunities involving the use of Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs).</p><p>In providing very generous tax relief on contributions to private pension arrangements, the <i>quid pro quo</i>is that when benefits are paid from the arrangements they are, generally, taxed at the owner's marginal rate.  The tax planning that was taking place involved the RAC or PRSA owner never maturing or vesting the contracts involved so that the pension benefits were never paid out.  The RAC or PRSA could pass to the owner's spouse or civil partner on death in a tax-free manner and, as no benefits had been drawn down, no benefit crystallisation event (BCE) arose which could give rise to a tax known as chargeable excess tax if the owner's overall retirement benefits exceeded the life-time Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) limit of &euro;2 million or a higher Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) limit if the individual had one.</p><p>The changes made in the Finance Act 2016 ensure that all RAC and PRSA contracts will, in future, be deemed to vest no later than the owner's 75th birthday.  The amendments also include transitional arrangements to provide that, in situations where the RAC or PRSA owner had attained the age of 75 years before the date on which the Finance Act 2016 passed into law i.e. 25 December 2016, their RAC or PRSA is deemed to vest on that date.</p><p>A key feature in ensuring that these anti-avoidance provisions work is that the administrator of the RAC or PRSA pension arrangement in question must have the necessary information to determine if the deemed vesting of the arrangement brings the value of the individual's lifetime pension benefits over the SFT or PFT limit, so that any chargeable excess tax arising can be determined and paid over to Revenue.  To that end, the legislation (section 787R(5A)(b) TCA 1997) requires all RAC or PRSA owners whose arrangements are deemed to vest on their 75 birthday or 25 December 2016, as appropriate, to provide a declaration to their  pension fund administrator setting out the value of any prior pension benefits taken by the individual from other pension arrangements.  The declaration has to be provided within 30 days of the deemed vesting of the RAC or PRSA.  Where a declaration is not made, the legislation requires the administrator to assume that the individual has already &quot;used up&quot; their SFT or PFT limit, as appropriate, and to subject the entire value of the RAC or PRSA to chargeable excess tax at 40%.  It should be noted that the legislation provides that Revenue will make any necessary adjustments where it subsequently transpires that some or all of the value of the pension arrangement should not have been charged to tax.</p><p>While the onus is on the individual RAC or PRSA owner to provide the declaration to their pension fund administrator, regardless of whether the administrator requests them to do so, I understand that administrators have taken the initiative to identify and contact clients who may come within the deeming provisions of the legislation, requesting them to provide the necessary declaration.  It may be in this context, that the Deputy's constituent has been approached by the Insurance Company concerned seeking a signed declaration.</p><p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that officials from my Department and Revenue met with representatives of Insurance Ireland during the passage of Finance Act 2016 to consider aspects of the new legislation including concerns regarding older vulnerable clients who might not be in a position to meet their obligations due, for example, to ill health.  I understand that it was agreed that Revenue would address any such difficulties, brought to their attention by member companies, on a case by case basis.  I am informed that this position was subsequently communicated by Insurance Ireland to its members.</p><p>In the circumstances, therefore, I would suggest that the Deputy arrange to have the relevant details relating to this case communicated to Revenue at Financial Services (Pensions), Large Cases Division, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Ballaugh House, 73-79 Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, D02 PX37, email lcdretirebens@revenue.ie, so that Revenue can address the issue directly with the insurance company concerned.</p></reply>

This Final Decision was later published in December 2016.</p><p>The Government disagrees profoundly with the Commission's analysis and will now challenge the Commission's decision before the European Courts.  This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign Member State competence of taxation.</p><p>This issue is a priority matter for the State and the Irish authorities engaged fully with the Commission throughout the process.  This has involved a significant degree of legal and technical complexity, and additional expertise has been engaged where required.</p><p>During the investigation, detailed and comprehensive responses were provided to the Commission to demonstrate that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged in accordance with the relevant legislation, that no selective advantage was given and that there was no State Aid.</p><p>This has continued in 2016 with the annulment application that has now been lodged in the General Court of the European.  Expertise has also been engaged in respect of the recovery process.</p><p>Over the past three years approximately &euro;1.85 million has been paid in total, including VAT.

It is not unusual to find that a tax settlement with Revenue may, for example, cover outstanding liabilities in respect of corporation tax, VAT and PAYE tax. </p><p>I am further informed by Revenue that while they capture the various constituents of yield tax or duty, interest on late payment and penalties their records do not capture each of the separate or specific types of contraventions of law uncovered.  On that basis, the information sought by the Deputy is not available.</p><p>The Deputy should also be aware that work is ongoing between officials from my Department, the Department of Social Protection and Revenue following a public consultation last year where submissions were sought from interested parties on the &quot;Use of Intermediary-Type Structures and Self-employment Arrangements&quot; and their impact on tax and PRSI.

In Dublin house prices began to decline earlier than the rest of the country reaching a trough in 2012.  Since then the recovery in the economy, the sustained growth in employment and demographic changes have underpinned the 50 per cent increase in national house prices (66 per cent increase in Dublin).  The growth in house prices reflects the as yet insufficient supply response to meet the demand for housing.  For example, in the 12 months to November 2016, 14,728 units were constructed and while this represents an 18 per cent increase over the same period in 2015, it remains significantly below estimated demographic demand of 25,000-30,000 units per annum.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has adopted Rebuilding Ireland, Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  This Plan constitutes a whole of government approach and aims, through some 84 actionable measures, to address the underlying structural constraints which continue to inhibit new housing supply.  The implementation of the Action Plan will lead to the increased provision of social housing, the streamlining of the planning system and the removal of infrastructural constraints.  Many of these actions will improve the viability of construction particularly in urban regions. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the particular challenges faced by first time buyers in accessing the housing market, I introduced the Help-to-Buy initiative as part of Budget 2017.  The initiative complements Rebuilding Ireland by providing immediate, targeted and time bound support to first time buyers as the measures announced in the Action Plan are rolled out but before they start to yield results.</p></reply>

EFSI's ability to deliver in a particular Member State is dependent on there being suitable public and private projects under its two funding windows - the Infrastructure and Innovation Window (IIW) and the SME Window.</p>  <p>  EFSI provides an important additional funding mechanism to support investment in the pursuit of employment and growth.  It should be considered alongside the other suite of investment mechanisms including the (European Investment Bank) EIB's normal lending activities.  For the private sector there are also the commercially available financing options.  In the case of the public sector, the State's capital investment programme is sufficiently funded via the state's borrowings through the NTMA, while other mechanisms such as PPPs and off-balance sheet vehicles are additional potential options for funding investment. </p>  <p>  Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP companies and I am pleased that the primary health care centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  It should be remembered that each EFSI loan entered into by the State pre-commits funding for the repayment of such loans, and has to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.    </p>  <p>  The European Union's Financial Instruments are important for the implementation of the Government's commitment to supporting the financing needs of SMEs and ensuring that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.  Such European Financial Instruments include the COSME and InnovFin Guarantee Programmes, both of which are made available under the EFSI SME Window.  In 2016, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) successfully applied for a &euro;100 million guarantee facility under the COSME programme, and will use this facility to support the delivery of the Agri Cash Flow Support Loan Fund for Farmers as announced in Budget 2017, on behalf of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The SBCI has also submitted an application for the InnovFin counter guarantee to the European Investment Fund (EIF) and, if the application is successful, intends to use that counter guarantee to create a pilot program to offer a guaranteed loan product through partner bank(s). </p>  <p>  As indicated, EFSI represents an additional funding option open to Government Departments, Agencies and commercial semi-State companies.  As such, it is a matter for each of these entities to consider the potential eligibility of their projects for EFSI funding.  Generally, Departments would have existing relationships with the European Investment Bank, which has responsibility for the management and operation of EFSI.  Government Departments would, in the process of appraising their funding options for a particular project, engage with the EIB to consider the eligibility of their project for EFSI funding.  My officials are currently compiling a list, through the EIB, of projects that have been approved for EFSI support in the State and I will forward the list to the Deputy in due course.  However, this list may not be complete as it is possible that Irish private sector projects may receive funding from EFSI supported funds in other jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for capital expenditure and, in this context, engages with each line Department on an ongoing basis to consider and assess projects and the full range of available funding options.</p></reply>

In addition the volume of non-alcoholic beer beverages released for consumption in not reported to Revenue as excise duty is not applicable on the sale of beverages where the alcoholic content is below 1.2% by volume.

The central piece of the SSM supervisory process is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under which ECB led joint supervisory teams inspect business models, internal governance, profitability and banking risks.</p>  <p>  All of these new regulations and institutional arrangements have been designed to address the challenges of banking oversight and resolution at a European level and provide for a pro-active approach towards systemic and emergent risks. Besides the introduction of new European and national regulations, the Central Bank too has increased its resources and has become more pro-active in addressing systemic risk. This entire new framework is designed to secure a safe, responsible, and growth enhancing financial sector in Europe, while protecting consumers and the economy. </p>  <p>  Financial regulation developments in other jurisdictions warrant ongoing attention by the EU and by the Central Bank, and let me assure the Deputy that both my Department and the Central Bank are continually monitoring international developments in collaboration with our EU colleagues.</p></reply>

Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014. These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.</p><p>I regularly receive correspondence from individuals with disabilities that do not meet the criteria but who believe they would benefit from the Scheme.  The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.</p><p>While I have sympathy with those who do not qualify for Scheme, I cannot, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, expand it further within the current context of constrained resources.</p><p>Furthermore, it is not possible to cost the extension of the scheme in the way the Deputy has requested.</p></reply>

Outputs include:</p><p>- A scoping study in November 2015 under the Department of Finance-ESRI joint research programme,</p><p>- Initial short-term estimates published in the Summer Economic Statement 2016,</p><p>- An in-depth analysis of the possible sectoral and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published with Budget 2017; and,</p><p>- A joint research paper with the ESRI that modelled the medium to long term macroeconomic impact of Brexit under a number of scenarios, including a hard Brexit. </p><p>All of these outputs have been made public.</p><p>In particular, the medium to long term economic impacts of a &quot;hard Brexit&quot; are set out in the November 2016 joint paper with the ESRI - this was the analysis which my officials were referring to.</p><p>The paper, which used the new ESRI COSMO macroeconomic model, highlights that the impact on the Irish economy will be significant.  Looking at the effect ten years after a UK exit, a hard Brexit scenario results in the level of GDP being almost 4 per cent below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario; with most of impact coming in the first five years. The level of employment is expected to be 2 per cent below what it would otherwise have been; in other words, employment growth will be slower than would otherwise be the case.  On the public finances side, the deficit and debt ratios would be 1 and 10 percentage points higher. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the impacts of a hard Brexit were also considered by the ESRI in a separate analysis in November 2017 that looked at the impact of WTO trade tariffs. The findings in that paper, in broad orders of magnitude, are consistent with those in the joint research my Department published with the ESRI that same month.</p><p>I would stress that all of these results are based on a no policy change assumption. To this extent, the measures that I announced in Budget 2017 are a first step in what will be an ongoing process of getting Ireland Brexit ready.</p></reply>

Within the paper, and in line with existing international analysis, three scenarios were considered. This includes a scenario where the UK and EU do not conclude a bilateral trade agreement and, instead, the UK exercises its rights under the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).  (In practice any proposed UK WTO schedule would have to be agreed by all WTO members.) Our contingency work, rightly, is examining all scenarios. However, we are at the start of a process within which there is expected to be a number of phases. Ireland will participate fully in all of the structures of the EU 27 in preparing for and conducting the negotiations. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue working with both our EU partners and with the UK to maintain a positive, constructive and orderly approach to these negotiations.

One subject was introduced in 2014 - English. Two further subjects commenced in September 2016 - Business Studies and Science. The 'Framework for Junior Cycle 2015', published by my Department in August 2015, sets out the key changes under the new programme which includes a new award for students - the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA). During the years when students are studying subjects for which new specifications have been provided alongside existing Junior Certificate subjects, the results of the latter will be included in the JCPA. The format of the JCPA will evolve as the various phases of junior cycle reform are rolled out. The Junior Certificate will no longer be issued by the State Examinations Commission (SEC).

CBAs form a key element of the new Junior Cycle. Therefore, students who are taught by a teacher who is a member of the ASTI will not receive a grade for their CBAs and also since the written Assessment Task which is to be completed by students is linked to the second CBA, which is worth 10% of the marks for the final examination, these students cannot complete the Assessment Task, or gain marks for this examination component. Candidates for Junior Cycle English in 2017 who do not complete the assessment task can only be marked and graded based on a maximum of 90% of the available marks.</p>  <p>  My Department requested the ASTI to provide an immediate derogation from their directive regarding the CBAs for current teachers of English in order that some current third year English students are no longer unfairly and unjustifiably disadvantaged. </p>  <p>  Following talks with the teacher unions in late 2016, facilitated by the Chair of the Teachers Conciliation Council, it was provided that, on a once-off basis, the NCCA and SEC would communicate arrangements in respect of a second calendar window in the 2016/17 school year to allow for the completion and submission of the Junior Cycle English Assessment Task by students who were prevented from meeting the initial deadline.  These arrangements were notified to schools in the week beginning 19th December 2016.</p>  <p>  This second window was agreed as a result of an acknowledgement by the parties that a significant number of students were not in a position to meet the timing requirement of completion between 5th and 9th December 2016, as a result of industrial action taken by the ASTI. </p>  <p>  I welcome the decision of the ASTI to give its members a say on the overall offer now available following the recently concluded talks under the Chair of the Teachers Conciliation Council.  In addition to the elements relating to Junior Cycle, the proposals involve immediate pay increases and other benefits for ASTI members.  While the ASTI&rsquo;s leadership has recommended rejection, a decision on whether to accept the proposals or to reject them and engage again in industrial action will now be taken by the wider membership at ballot.  The ASTI is currently conducting its ballot of members and it is important to respect the democratic process that is now underway.</p></reply>

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the new model of induction and probation for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  The Droichead programme was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Council in March 2016. The programme is being introduced on a phased basis since last September.</p>  <p>  During the growth and development phase of Droichead, teachers employed in a special education or restricted setting must avail of the Droichead programme to achieve full registration with the Council.  While a new policy on teacher probation was adopted by the Teaching Council last December, this does not change the requirement for teachers in a special education setting to avail of Droichead.</p>  <p>  The INTO issued a directive to its members not to cooperate with or participate in Droichead from 1 July 2016. This directive has prevented newly qualified teachers employed in special education settings from participating in Droichead since September and thereby closed off the registration pathway. I hope the INTO will review its approach.  </p>  <p>  My Department is considering the impact of the changes to the Droichead policy. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has confirmed that there are 4,868 teachers who currently have the condition of probation/Droichead attached to their teacher registration. This is the number of individuals registered with the Teaching Council and should not be taken as an indicator of employment status in schools (e.g. teaching in mainstream, teaching in SEN settings (resource and/or learning support), teaching outside the state and those not currently teaching).</p></reply>

The levy is collected through the PAYE/PRSI system and funds are transferred monthly to my Department by the Department of Social Protection. NTF income also includes European Social Fund refunds and European Globalisation Funds.</p>  <p>  The level of receipts from the employment levy over the next three years is expected to be as follows: &euro;405 million in 2017,  &euro;426 million in 2018 and &euro;444 million in 2019.  The actual amount collected will depend on the numbers in employment each year.</p>  <p>  The level of expenditure from the NTF will depend on the demand for services. The overall level of investment in training is in line with previous years but there has been a rebalancing of funding from training for employment to training those in employment to take account of the improved employment situation.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;366.3 million has been allocated this year from the NTF.  It should be noted that NTF funding forms part of the Department&rsquo;s annual overall expenditure ceiling and, unless the rate of the levy changes, fiscal rules mean that any increase in NTF expenditure would have to be offset by reductions in expenditure elsewhere.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy may wish to note that, in advance of such a review being undertaken, considerable progress has already been made in a number of areas identified by Government as forming part of such a review.</p>  <p>  In this connection, the Programme for a Partnership Government indicated that a review of the resources and structures required by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to meet its statutory objective of deciding appeals within 18 weeks was one aspect of the planning system that would be specifically addressed. This is now being progressed in the context of the implementation of the recommendations of the Organisational Review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, undertaken by an independent expert panel, which was published in March 2016.  An Implementation Group, comprising representation from my Department and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, has been established to oversee the implementation of the Review Group recommendations with a view to ensuring that the Board is appropriately positioned and fit for purpose from an organisational perspective to achieve its legislative mandate in this regard.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to ensure that the planning system remains accessible and responsive to projected increased construction activity as the economy recovers, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland, which was published in July 2016, proposed a review of the forecasting, planning and delivery of residential development as another strand in the overall review of the planning system. In this connection, the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provides for the introduction of temporary fast- track planning arrangements, whereby planning applications for large-scale housing developments (100+ units), including student accommodation, can be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and determined within a specified time frame, with a view to facilitating the earlier provision of increased housing supply. Work is now progressing on the preparation of the regulations and guidance necessary to bring the new procedures into operation at an early date.</p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland also referred, in the context of an overall review of the planning system, to the introduction and integration of technological efficiencies such as e-planning ( i.e. online submission of planning applications and appeals) to facilitate a more modern and responsive planning system. The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which recently passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and which it is intended will be enacted by the Summer, includes enabling provision to facilitate the introduction of e-planning.</p></reply>

The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016, on a pilot basis, and it is my intention that the scheme will be available nationally by April 2017.</p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB). This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years. The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.</p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead. Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties. </p>  <p>  A scheme of this nature will require both significant capital and current exchequer investment expenditure over the next 5 years and therefore must be properly analysed and assessed to ensure the best use of public money. The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is appropriately modelled from a financial perspective but also, and critically, that it is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives and delivers high quality social housing effectively.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency, who are assisting with implementation of the scheme, are in regular contact with the two pilot local authorities and I understand that the pilot is progressing well at a local level. In parallel, my Department is also in contact with other local authorities to assist them with necessary preparations for the roll-out of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Several AHBs are working together with the Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas and, as the scheme becomes available nationally, I expect that more AHBs will become involved in the roll out of the scheme. AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I have committed to making &euro;140m available over that period. While the current target for 2017 is 150 units, the interest expressed by property owners and stakeholders so far indicates that the 2017 targets will be achieved and could potentially be exceeded following national roll out. Taking account of this, the capacity of local authorities and AHBs to deliver under the scheme, as well as the necessary agreement on the financial considerations arising, I am exploring how delivery under the new scheme might be accelerated.</p>  <p>  I would encourage any local authorities that are eager to engage early with the scheme to liaise with the pilot local authorities and my Department, in order to be familiar with the requirements around participation and also the practical implementation issues that are being worked through with the pilot scheme.</p></reply>

This provides cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows/widowers pension (contributory). </p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation stipulates that a self-employed contributor shall not be regarded as satisfying the qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory), unless all outstanding self-employment contributions have been paid by him/her in full.  Where contributions are paid subsequent to a claimant&rsquo;s 66th birthday, State pension (contributory) can only be awarded from the date on which the self-employment liability has been fully discharged. These provisions are consistent with the contributory and solidarity principles which underpin the social insurance system.</p>  <p>  In the event that a person has not paid the required PRSI contributions to qualify for a State pension (contributory), they may make a claim for the State pension (non-contributory), subject to their satisfying the qualifying conditions for that payment.  The maximum rate of that pension is 95% that of the maximum contributory pension rate, and while it is means-tested, over 70% of recipients receive it at the full rate.  If a person only qualifies for this payment at a reduced rate, they will generally have more means, when the payment is taken into account, than a person wholly dependent upon the State pension.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note matters related to the collection of tax are outside the responsibility of my Department, and should be pursued with the Revenue Commissioners.  Income tax and outstanding PRSI payable by a self-employed contributor is treated as one aggregate sum in accordance with the provisions of social welfare legislation. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

We continue to be committed to these aims notwithstanding the changed political context in the United States.  The Government has raised the issue of immigration reform with US interlocutors &ndash; including at the highest levels &ndash; on many occasions.  I personally raised the issue when I met then-Secretary of State John Kerry in Co. Tipperary, on 30 October 2016. I also raised it when I spoke to Speaker Paul Ryan by telephone on 23 November 2016.  The Government has also availed of every opportunity to sensitise the new Administration to our concerns and interests regarding immigration reform, and the plight of the undocumented Irish in particular.  The Taoiseach raised the matter in his separate telephone conversations with then President-elect Trump and Vice-President-elect Pence in the days following the Presidential election.  The issue will also feature high on the agenda for my planned visit to Washington DC in early February.  The upcoming St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day engagements will provide a further opportunity to express to senior figures in the new Administration and Congress our aims and concerns in relation to the undocumented.  </p>  <p>  In addition to these political efforts, our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the United States will continue to engage with Irish community groups in relation to their concerns.  Ambassador Anderson convened a meeting of senior immigration stakeholders at our Embassy in Washington on 12 January in order to hear directly from those who work most-closely with the undocumented Irish.</p>  <p>  We are continuing to support organisations that deliver frontline advisory services and community care to Irish emigrants through the Emigrant Support Programme.  More than 70% of the funds allocated through this programme are directed towards welfare services, including in support of the undocumented Irish in the U.S.  In the last funding round of the Emigrant Support Programme, organisations in the U.S were allocated more than &euro;2.3 million in funding.  The Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and our Embassy in Washington will continue to work closely with Irish-American community leaders in actively pursuing all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform.  We will encourage and promote any realistic possibilities for a solution that may arise.</p></reply>

If a blanket suite of social benefit clauses was attached to all public procurement opportunities it is likely that this would be ineffective and disproportionately favour larger enterprises and reduce competition in supplying goods and services to the State. </p>  <p>  In general, the inclusion of social clauses in a procurement process would appear to be most effective where the benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority's policy or strategic plan.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause.  This may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that a revised set of EU Directives governing public procurement was transposed into Irish law last May.  There is now greater scope and legal clarity in relation to the use of social criteria in the context of an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  Contracting Authorities are therefore already free to include social benefit clauses in public procurement processes.</p>  <p>  In relation to sustainability, comprehensive guidance is available to public authorities assist them in this regard in the "Action Plan on Green Public Procurement", published on 2012, and "Green Procurement Guidance for the Public Sector", published in 2014.  In addition, the Office of Government Procurement is assessing the scope for the use of such clauses and is developing practical guidance to assist contracting authorities using procurement as a driver of wider public policy goals such as sustainability, where appropriate.

However, in relation to public servants generally including those in non-commercial state bodies, the Deputy may be aware that an Interdepartmental Working Group, chaired by my Department, was established in early 2016. This Group was to examine the issues arising from prevailing retirement ages for workers in both the public and private sectors, in the context of the increase in the State Pension age from 65 to 66 in 2014 and the scheduled further increases to the State Pension age in 2021 and 2028. </p>  <p>  The Group, whose Report was agreed by Government last August, considered policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors, examining implications arising from retirement ages now and in the future. The Group identified a set of framework principles to underpin policy in the area and made a number of recommendations assigned to Government Departments and Employer bodies for follow-up in that regard. A copy of the Report is available online at http://www.per.gov.ie/en/report-of-the-interdepartmental-group-on-fuller-working-lives/.   </p>  <p>  On foot of one of the recommendations of the Report, my Department, with Public Service employers, was tasked to review the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce up to and including the current age of entitlement to the Contributory State Pension. This review is currently underway and is expected to be completed by the Q2 2017.</p></reply>

It does so in a progressively structured way which has a proportionately greater effect on higher value pensions. At all times, public service pensions up to a value of &euro;12,000 have been unaffected by PSPR, while a higher exemption threshold of &euro;32,500 has applied to pensions awarded from 1 March 2012 onwards.</p>  <p>  PSPR is being significantly reversed or restored in three stages under FEMPI 2015 over the 2016 to 2018 period, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  When fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, the changes will mean that all public service pensions with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in the majority of cases, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year. The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p>  <p>  Since all public service pensions with pre-PSPR value greater than &euro;32,500 have been negatively affected by PSPR, it follows that all such pensions will be increased by this three-stage restoration under FEMPI 2015.</p></reply>

In this regard the Deputy will be aware that I announced on Budget Day that my Department would, by the middle of 2017, complete a review of the Capital Investment Plan published in September 2015. The objective of the Capital Review will be to provide a focused analysis of capital spending and it will provide the Government with an opportunity to reaffirm priorities and, if necessary, recalibrate investment plans. The key task, however, will be to recommend how the remaining unallocated capital funding should be allocated over the period of the plan, having regard to the priority areas identified in the Government's Programme.  </p>  <p>  The effective management of expenditure has played a key role in ensuring Ireland met or exceeded its key fiscal targets over the past number of years. This continues to be the case, with the management of the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations being a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department. My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  The Government is now in a position to provide for sustainable levels of expenditure growth to support improvements in public services. The Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2017 sets out total gross voted expenditure of &euro;58.1 billion in 2017. This represents a year on year increase of over 3 per cent on the 2016 allocation and is a prudent level of increase as we continue to repair the public finances. However, we have to be mindful of the considerable expenditure pressures facing the public finances and it is important that we continue to evaluate how we spend our money to ensure that limited resources provide much needed public services and social infrastructure. Given this context, I announced on Budget day that a spending review will be carried out in advance of Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  Given the many competing priorities and demands for resources, there is an ongoing requirement to implement reforms that improve how public services are delivered, and that achieve savings which can be reinvested in frontline services.  The Public Service has delivered significant productivity gains and service improvements over the last number of years, as set out in the Annual Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan (published April 2016).  We must build on this progress, and it is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is done in tandem with further public service reform measures. This includes, for example, more digital delivery of services, improved customer service and business processes, and greater use of shared services. When Departments identify savings arising from such reform measures, such savings are in general made available to Departments to reinvest in the delivery of services.  It is also very important to ensure that the public service workforce operates in a manner which maximises the positive impact on public service provision of the increased staff numbers reflected in the budgetary allocations for 2017.</p></reply>

This allows us to balance pay increases in the public service with other societal priorities including improvements in housing and health care.</p><p>The Labour Court Recommendation on Garda pay issued on 3<sup>rd</sup>of November last had serious implications for the continued viability of the Lansdowne Road Agreement and this needed to be addressed.</p><p>This process of engagement between public service management and the Public Service Committee of ICTU has been completed.</p><p>In acknowledgement of the anomaly that has arisen, the Government in its capacity as the public service employer, agreed to an increase in annualised salaries of &euro;1,000 for the period April to August 2017 inclusive for:</p><p>- those on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000;</p><p>- who are parties to the Lansdowne Road Agreement; and</p><p>- who do not stand to benefit from the Labour Court recommendations (CD/16/321 &amp;amp; CD/16/322) issued in respect of the Garda Associations.</p><p>This additional payment is being offered by Government on the understanding that there will be continued adherence to the terms of the LRA, and in particular, its mechanisms to resolve disagreements before they escalate into industrial disputes over the remaining period of the Agreement.

Since the first Public Service Reform Plan was published in 2011, a comprehensive programme of reform has been implemented and this continues to be a key priority.  This is important as the performance of the Public Service has major implications for the management of the State's finances, and for economic development and employment creation.</p>  <p>  We are now at the end of the final year of the implementation of the current three year Public Service Reform Plan 2014   2016.  The Reform Plan has enabled a transformation of how we do our work as public servants, putting citizens ever more to the centre of what we do both in terms of service delivery and transparency, openness and accountability. In addition, reform is continuing to deliver savings across a range of specific areas such as shared services, procurement reform and property management. The launch of the Public Service ICT Strategy in will permit the public service to use new digital methods to improve online delivery of services and reduce costs. These reform initiatives will ensure that the public service along with the private sector continues to each play their role in creating a positive climate for trade, investment and job creation. </p>  <p>  A new phase of public service reform, to cover the period 2017-20, is currently being developed and last September I invited the members of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to input to this process. This phase will consolidate the significant progress made since the first Public Service Reform Plan was launched in 2011. It will set out a series of actions to be delivered out to 2020 which will both build on the achievements of the last six years and respond to new challenges. </p>  <p>  Overall, I believe that there has been significant progress on Public Service Reform to date.  We must build on this progress and maintain a focus on Public Service Reform over the coming years.  It is essential that targeted recruitment and investment in public services is done in tandem with further Public Service reform measures, not least as current and future demographic trends will continue to place demands on public service delivery.</p></reply>

The strengthening of procurement professionalisation will in turn provide public bodies who use the contracts and frameworks with increased certainty and reduced risk by providing them with compliant sourcing solutions.  </p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to further reform of public procurement, the Government has committed in the Programme for Partnership Government to refining the new procurement structures in place and to make adjustments according to best international practice and in conjunction with Irish business.  </p></reply>

Under this initiative, the NTPF estimates that around 3,000 patients waiting 18 months or more for daycase procedures will be treated, with the aim that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for daycase treatment by 30 June 2017.  This Initiative will initially focus on key specialties with high numbers of long-waiting patients, including in Ophthalmology.  While the associated tender process is ongoing, the NTPF has advised that there has been good engagement with all the major private hospitals and these hospitals are ready to play a significant role in this Initiative.  It is expected that the outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition, in December 2016, the Department wrote to the HSE requesting that it submit in January, a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017 in respect of both the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List and the Outpatient Waiting List.  The focus of these plans should be to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months on either list by the end of October 2017.  The HSE has been requested to develop the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List Action Plan in conjunction with and supported by, the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of the remaining &euro;10m of 2017 funding for patient treatment.

The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE. </p>  <p>  For a medicine to be considered for reimbursement it must first have a marketing authorisation from the European Medicine Agency (EMA), before being assessed under the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The EMA provides independent recommendations on medicines for human and veterinary use, based on a comprehensive scientific evaluation of data. </p>  <p>  The EMA&rsquo;s evaluations of marketing authorisation applications provide the basis for the authorisation of medicines in Europe.  This is separate to the Statutory Assessment process conducted by the HSE.</p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that Biogen have applied to the EMA for market authorisation in the EU for the drug Nusinersen brand name Spinraza.  The application to the EMA was submitted in Autumn 2016. The EMA assessment process generally takes around one year.</p>  <p>  Should Nusinersen receive European marketing authorisation, the manufacturer would then be open to make an application to the HSE to have the product reimbursed under the community drug schemes.</p>  <p>  The operation of patient access schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need.  However I understand that following an application from a consultant paediatric neurologist at Temple Street hospital, the company has extended their early access programme to two of his patients with SMA Type 1 and that the patients' families have been informed.</p></reply>

Patients apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish-based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it. </p>  <p>  The result of the EU referendum in the UK means that the UK electorate have declared their wish to leave the EU.  It is important to be clear that until the UK formally withdraws from the Union, it remains a full member, with all of its existing rights and obligations.  I wish to assure the Deputy that there are no immediate changes in the area of health as a consequence of the UK's decision to leave the EU.  Irish patients who had planned to travel to the UK under the Treatment Abroad Scheme may continue to do so as planned. </p>  <p>  An extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiations Task Force, is under way.  This engagement is being intensified in 2017.  The Taoiseach and Ministers will continue to meet and engage with their EU counterparts over coming weeks to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and to ensure that they are fully reflected in the EU position once negotiations commence.</p></reply>

A dedicated Non-EU Registration Team and a dedicated Irish Registration Team have also been established. Revisions to the NMBI's existing application forms and guidance documents are currently under review in order to assist applicants through the process - these are among a number of significant changes being implemented by the NMBI. These changes will enhance and improve the registration process for applicants while the NMBI will continue to review its processes to ensure that they meet requirements while also meeting the central principle of protecting the public.</p></reply>

Some 6,300 farmers received an allocation of entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve.  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by claw-back derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to replenish the National Reserve.  Under the National Reserve priority access for an allocation of entitlements is given to the two mandatory categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant to farming&rsquo;.  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve in 2017 will be made once the position on potential funding has been established.</p>  <p>  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve.  Consultation in relation to the 2017 Reserve is due to take place shortly.</p></reply>

Commissioner Hogan acknowledged the desirability of bringing about lower prices, but indicated that, despite considerable efforts on his part both with other Member States and internally within the Commission, this is proving very difficult to achieve.</p></reply>

At present, eligible land under the scheme is designated by reference to criteria such as stocking density, family farm income, population density and the percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture.</p><p>Under the new system of designation which must be introduced in 2018, eligible areas will have to be designated on the basis of biophysical criteria.  The criteria set out in the legislation are:</p><p>- Low temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.  This analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel, be subjected to a refinement process via fine tuning.  As part of this process, my officials have been in direct contact with the EU Commission and its science and knowledge service, the Joint Research Centre.</p><p>Once this process is complete, the draft data will provide the basis for the identification of eligible areas for ANC.  It is envisaged that  stakeholders will be consulted as this process develops.  The regulatory requirement is for the new system to be implemented for payment under the 2018 scheme.</p></reply>

The successful tenderer will be directly involved in drawing up the terms and conditions for the new schemes, along with the range of actions to be applied and associated payments.  This will be done in consultation with officials from my Department and from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as well as drawing on local knowledge and inputs from farmers on the ground.  Once this stage has been completed, the process of recruiting farmers for a five year scheme will commence.</p>  <p>  I have also launched an Open Call under the European Innovation Partnerships Initiative (EIP) inviting applications for funding.  The Open Call is a new way of responding to local challenges.  It is an opportunity for farmers, researchers, advisors and scientists to look at new and traditional practices, develop ideas and research and promote forms of co-operation in their own areas. Projects developed under this Open Call also form part of my Department's new 'Locally-Led' initiative and I have provided a dedicated budget of &euro;24 million for projects emerging from this process. The closing date for the first of these Calls is 5pm on 27th January 2017 but there will be a second call later this year as well.</p>  <p>  Finally, as regards the Burren, my Department has already introduced this scheme which recently processed its second tranche of applications.  There are now some 320 farmers in the scheme &ndash; more than double the number that have ever participated before.  I propose to have a third and final tranche later this year.  All participants in this new scheme receive five year contracts, rather than the annual contracts that operated previously and I have set aside &euro;15m to fund the Programme over its lifetime. </p></reply>

Following a very productive meeting I subsequently initiated a number of responses to address key issues raised by stakeholders. </p>  <p>  As I set out at the Forum, one of my chief priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance for the industry and in this regard I was happy to announce subsequently, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme.  This has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), and will provide farmers, including tillage farmers, with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring on-going financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made in 2016 in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.</p>  <p>  Advance payments commenced on the 17 October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with the addition of balancing payments from the 1 December.  To date &euro;1,171 billion has been paid out to more than 123,078 farmers and payments are ongoing.  Payments of &euro;198 million have also been made to 92,200 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints scheme. </p>  <p>  In my concluding remarks to the stakeholder forum of last October, I reiterated my view that in the changing international economic landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand future challenges and to avail of new opportunities which may present themselves.  The Forum is therefore an opportunity to explore and build such opportunities, as well as addressing the challenges.  As I stated in the D&aacute;il just last week, I plan to convene a further meeting of the stakeholder&rsquo;s forum in the very near future.  This will provide the opportunity for all segments of the industry to work together to develop the sector.</p></reply>

There is free entry into the market and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. As such, I have no function in the setting of fuel prices. </p><p>The retail price of diesel is determined by a number of factors, and not just the price of crude oil.  One of these is the price of the product in the international marketplace.As oil is traded exclusively in US Dollars, the strength/weakness of that currency against the euro is a factor in the price paid by the end consumer.  </p><p>In addition, crude oil has to undergo several stages of production before it is refined into diesel for use in vehicles.  The cost of that process is also a factor in the end price paid. Finally, levies and taxes, such as excise duty, environmental taxes and VAT, make up about 60% of the retail price.  </p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC, under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) has a role in ensuring that the market is functioning correctly and that consumers are not being disadvantaged. Previous investigations and surveys into oil prices (available at ) that the CCPC have undertaken indicate that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by the internationally traded price of crude oil, the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, and taxation levels, along with the level of competition in the retail market. </p><p>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices for petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is: .</p><p>The latest bulletin from 16 January 2017 shows that diesel prices (including taxes) in Ireland were &euro;1.279 per litre.  The EU average for this period was &euro;1.242, with the price paid in the United Kingdom listed at &euro;1.39.</p></reply>

I would consider blacklisting of workers for whatever reason as an unacceptable practice &ndash; particularly if it arose in relation to workers exercising their rights to take part in trade union activities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there are already legislative protections in place where workers are victimised by an employer for trade union activity. </p>  <p>  Section 6(1) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 (as amended) provides that, in general, a dismissal shall be deemed to be unfair unless an employer can prove that there were substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.  In addition, Section 6 also deems certain dismissal situations to be unfair as well as outlining certain criteria on which dismissals may be adjudicated as fair.  One type of dismissal situation deemed to be unfair is referred to in Section 6(2)(a) of the Act which indicates that a dismissal is unfair where it can be shown that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from an employee&rsquo;s trade union membership or activities, either where those activities take place outside working hours or at those times during working hours when permitted by the employer.  While, in general, an employee must have been in the same employment for at least a year in order to bring a claim for unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, one of the exceptions to the one-year service requirement includes dismissals falling under section 6(2)(a) of the Act.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004 provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person, be they union representative, individual employee or manager, should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of their legitimate actions or affiliation arising from that dispute.  A procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation in such cases is set out the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  A complaint for breach of this legislation may be presented to the Workplace Relations Commission who can enforce rights breached.  That Code of Practice was amended in October 2015 to include as a form of victimisation the use by employers of inducements (financial or otherwise) designed specifically to have an employee forego collective representation by a trade union.</p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 also provides for enhanced protection for individuals who are victimised as a result of invoking the provisions of the 2001/2004 Industrial Relations Acts through a trade union or for acting as a witness or comparator for those provisions.</p>  <p>  If there is evidence that this is a widespread practice &ndash; and to date I do not have such evidence on the matter &ndash; I will be happy to consider the matter further with both sides of industry. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has any information regarding blacklisting of workers in Ireland, he might bring it either to my attention or to the Data Protection Commissioner.</p></reply>

It would be inappropriate for me to comment on this particular case. </p><p>More generally, apart from significant losses to the Exchequer that can arise from cases of so-called bogus self-employment, the practice has serious implications from an employment rights perspective.  In this respect, it is important that individuals are correctly designated as regards employment status so that those who ought to be designated as employees are not deprived of their employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers who may not feel in a position to object to certain arrangements. </p><p>Ireland has a well-resourced labour inspectorate, which forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and there are existing mechanisms in place to determine the employment status of individuals or groups.  Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain sectors, as a result of complaints received and on a routine basis.  Where the WRC inspection service receive complaints in relation to bogus self-employment or bogus sub-contracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and/or the Department of Social Protection (Scope Section) for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Workplace Relations Commission. </p><p>In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.  This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Government Departments with ICTU and IBEC.</p><p>Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches.  Complaints can be made on a single complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie</i>.  The WRC&rsquo;s Customer Service Section, which  provides information to both employers and employees in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059-9178990.</p></reply>

Exchange rate fluctuations will pose real challenges for low margin exporting sectors reliant on the UK market.  The volatility of exchange rates is clearly evident from developments over the last few months. </p><p>Given Brexit is likely to represent a structural shift in the UK trading relations with partners, short medium and long term responses are needed.  These include market diversification, cost reduction, value-add, innovation and price repositioning.  My Department and agencies are putting in place measures to address these issues for client companies.</p><p>My Department, along with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), Enterprise Ireland (EI) and stakeholders (such as SFA, ISME, IBEC and Chambers) is in the process of conducting a structured engagement with industry.  The purpose of this engagement is to deliver an evidence base, on which Government appropriate, tailored and targeted responses can be based to meet real identified business needs.  Work on this is advanced and the outcome of this structured engagement may lead to further discussions on State Aid concerns. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that EU Regulation No 1407/2013 (the <i>de minimis</i>Regulation) sets out the rules for granting small amounts of financial aid to enterprises which are unlikely to affect trade and distort competition (<i>de minimis</i>aid).  Generally, public bodies are allowed to grant aid to a single undertaking of up to &euro;200,000 over a 3 year fiscal period without prior notification or approval from DG Competition.  The Regulation requires that the aid is &lsquo;transparent&rsquo;. </p><p>Specific arrangements on <i>de minimis</i>aid apply in the following sectors:</p><p>- road freight transport sector</p><p>- primary production of agricultural products</p><p>- production, processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products.</p><p>As part of the revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) under the State Aid Modernisation Agenda, Member States and the Commission discussed a proposal to increase the <i>de minimis</i>threshold in 2013.  A number of Member States suggested increasing the <i>de minimis</i>threshold to &euro;500,000 over a three year fiscal period.  The European Commission rejected the proposal on the basis that the amount was substantial and could distort the competition in the Internal Market.  A more modest increase to &euro;300,000 was also declined.  The current State Aid framework does not allow for the re-calibration of aid intensity rates under the GBER or <i>de minimis</i>thresholds. </p><p>My Department has also initiated engagement with senior officials from the DG Competition to ensure Ireland can deliver the necessary supports to Irish enterprises within the EU State Aid rules.  These discussions are by no means over and will continue to address all relevant State Aid issues, if and when, the need arises to discuss initiatives or proposed schemes.</p></reply>

In response to that concern, I recently launched a public consultation on the issue together with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Tourism and Sport.  Though ticket resale has been the subject of considerable comment, there is a lack of reliable information about important aspects of the practice, including its extent, the sources of tickets put up for resale, and the prices achieved, as opposed to advertised, on the secondary ticket market.  The aim of the consultation is to provide us with a better understanding of the issue and to help us identify the practical measures that might be taken to give consumers fairer access to tickets in the future.  Those measures may include changes to the existing regulatory framework.  That will be determined following an assessment of the responses to the consultation and other relevant factors.</p>  <p>  My Department has overall responsibility for consumer protection.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Tourism and Sport have a role on the issue because of the wish to ensure that fans can access tickets for sporting events on fair terms and because of commitments given to UEFA in connection with the Euro 2020 Championship and to be given to World Rugby in connection with the bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.  Major concerts and sporting events also draw large numbers of visitors to Ireland and are important for the tourism sector.</p></reply>

In particular, Ireland&rsquo;s productivity has climbed from 12th to 6th place and in the area of manufacturing value added our performance has risen from 7th to 2nd place.  Ireland is performing well from a European perspective, with the latest European Innovation Scoreboard showing that Ireland climbed from 8th to 6th place.  We are leading in Europe in the economic effects indicator, which captures economic success stemming from innovation in terms of employment, revenue and exports.</p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, Ireland's cross-governmental strategy for Research and Development, Science and Technology, is based on a shared vision of Ireland becoming a global innovation leader, driving a strong, sustainable, high employment economy and a better society.  This strategy, led by my Department, sets out a roadmap to deliver on our vision and focuses on the excellence of our research, the development of our talent and the impact of our investment.  Continued implementation of Innovation 2020 will enable us to further narrow the gap with the world&rsquo;s most innovative countries and drive our objective of becoming a global innovation leader.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-26a.624.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012600072#WRV01800"><p>I always welcome academic contributions to the wider national debate on how Ireland can best benefit from our record high levels of foreign direct investment (FDI).  I also accept that FDI can make an even bigger contribution, all over Ireland, than it is now.  However, I think it is quite clear that the impact of FDI on our economy and society has been &ndash; and continues to be &ndash; overwhelmingly positive. </p>  <p>  For a start, overseas investment has played a huge part in our country&rsquo;s economic recovery and continues to drive job creation across Ireland.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s record results for 2016, which reflected our best ever job gains and levels of new investment, speak for themselves.  Those results show that in 2016 every regional location in Ireland saw net job increases, with 52% of all jobs created by the Agency&rsquo;s clients last year based outside of Dublin.  This reflects the intensive focus being placed on the best possible regional dispersal of FDI investments. </p>  <p>  The level of employment in overseas companies is only part of this positive picture.  FDI companies generally offer excellent quality and well paid jobs which have significant direct and indirect impacts on communities across the country.  The average salary in IDA approved jobs was &euro;51,237 in 2016, up from &euro;49,118 in 2015.  This is above the national average annual earnings of &euro;45,075 in 2015.   These salary levels are sustained by the high value jobs which we target in a diverse range of key sectors including international financial services, technology, life sciences and engineering. </p>  <p>  It is also the case that the jobs created by FDI drive other economic activity in the State.  It is estimated that every ten positions created by an IDA client company support a further seven jobs elsewhere in the economy.  When these jobs are included, the total employment impact of IDA Ireland clients extends to approximately 340,000 people.</p>  <p>  While there is always room for improvement, I believe our FDI led growth model has proven its worth in terms of attracting employment and investment.  I am confident that it will remain a key element of our national economic strategy for many years to come and that it will continue to yield benefits for people all over Ireland.</p></reply>

The issue of further recompense in respect of this mission was the subject of a claim under the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  There was adjudication hearing in respect of PDFORRA&rsquo;s claim in relation to their members service as part of the Operation Pontus missions.  This hearing took place on Wednesday 26 October 2016, following which, further discussions took place between my Department and PDFORRA.  The outcome of these discussions is currently under consideration by the Department in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I hope that the matter should be concluded within the next few weeks.</p></reply>
