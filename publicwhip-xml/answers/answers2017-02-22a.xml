    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-22a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022200070#WRB00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 43 together.</p>  <p>  Firstly, and to be clear, the Government&rsquo;s firm objective - as underlined in the clearest terms by the Taoiseach last week - is that there be no return to a hard border on this island. This is a political matter, not a legal or technical matter. It will have to be solved by political leadership and will require creativity, imagination and innovation.</p>  <p>  The retention of the open border we enjoy today is one of the benefits of the peace process which my Government colleagues and I are so determined to secure as part of the EU-UK negotiations.</p>  <p>  Every county in Ireland will be impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, but I am keenly aware of the particular concerns in the Border region, given the deep economic and social links across the border. </p>  <p>  Consequently, the Government&rsquo;s preparation for the forthcoming negotiations has been extensive. Dealing with the impact of Brexit is at the very top of our agenda and it has been since well before the referendum vote in the UK.</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear and consistent on our priorities for protecting Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the upcoming EU-UK negotiations. This includes minimising impact on trade and the economy, protecting the peace process and Northern Ireland including border issues and maintaining the Common Travel Area. </p>  <p>  We have to be clear, however, that in relation to the border - and indeed in relation to many other areas &ndash; both the UK and the EU will need to compromise if we are to achieve the demanding objectives that the Government has set.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed with Prime Minister May the serious implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the imperative of retaining the open border on the island of Ireland, at their meeting in Dublin on 30 January.  There will be a need for the British Government to reflect the unique challenges Brexit poses for Northern Ireland in the position they adopt in the negotiations with the EU27.  I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire in our meeting on 14 February.</p>  <p>  When the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union commence, we, together with our EU partners, will face the UK across the negotiating table and will strive for a deal that everyone can accept but, more importantly, that protects Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including maintaining the open border on this island.  However, the Government is under no illusions about the hard work needed to deliver this.</p>  <p>  As part of our preparations for the negotiations, I have been in contact with all of my EU counterparts in order to sensitise them to the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island &ndash; a process to which the EU has already made a key contribution.</p>  <p>  From my engagement with all of my EU counterparts, as well as with the EU Institutions, most notably my recent discussions with Michel Barnier, Chair of the European Commission Taskforce on Brexit and Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, there is deep appreciation of the EU&rsquo;s role and contribution in support of the peace process and a wish to continue that support, regardless of the challenges and changes of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with all of our EU partners to highlight the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, and the consequences for North-South cooperation on the island as a whole, which must be factored into any new EU relationship with the UK.</p></reply>

And, if so, when that might have the greatest impact.My two visits to the region have contributed to that ongoing consideration, and I have discussed the question with both local leaders and EU colleagues. </p><p>The motions passed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in this regard in 2014 are obviously important factors, but ultimately this is a decision for the Government, and there are many factors to take into account, both positive and negative.</p><p>I am also acutely conscious that the situation on the ground has continued to deteriorate, and efforts to reanimate the political process have not yet been successful.</p><p>Deputies may also have seen a recent story in the Israeli newspaper <i>Haaretz</i>that Ireland was about to recognise Palestine. This is just speculation, and has no basis.</p></reply>

The latest hearing was dominated by consideration by the judges of petitions from lawyers acting on behalf of some of the defendants.  After hearing these, the judges decided that witnesses could not be called on this occasion because a number of defendants, who are also involved in other cases, were not present in the court.</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador&rsquo;s assessment is that, notwithstanding the latest adjournment, the new panel of judges in the case are determined to move the case forward.  Hearings in December and January have seen witnesses called and cross-examined for the first time since the trial began.  The Irish Government has been present at and has observed every hearing in the trial to date and will be present at all future hearings.</p>  <p>  Between now and the next hearing date in March, it is envisaged that the Embassy team will conduct a further consular visit with our citizen in order to discuss with him directly any issues arising in relation to the case and his health and welfare.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department maintain ongoing contact with this man&rsquo;s family and his Egyptian and Irish-based legal teams and they have been in contact with the family again following the latest hearing in the case.</p>  <p>  The reality is that it is the Egyptian authorities that are detaining this citizen, and only the Egyptian authorities can make the decision to return him to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has been in contact directly and personally with Egyptian President el-Sisi on numerous occasions now calling on him to exercise his powers under Egyptian law to resolve this case and return our citizen to Ireland.</p>  <p>  For my part, I have availed of every appropriate opportunity to raise this case with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, and I can assure the House that I will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  I and my colleagues in Government and our officials will continue to do everything possible and appropriate to apply pressure on Cairo on this young man&rsquo;s behalf both directly and through and with EU and international partners.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-22a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022200071#WRC01000"><p>The visit of President Michael D Higgins to Cuba last week, as part of his official three country visit to Latin America, marked a high point in bilateral relations between Ireland and Cuba.  The visit was historic in that it was the first by a serving President of Ireland to Cuba.</p>  <p>  During the visit, a Memorandum of Cooperation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Cuba was signed by David Stanton TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for Equality, Immigration and Integration.  I warmly welcome the signature of this agreement, the core aim of which is to open channels of dialogue and cooperation between Ireland and Cuba, particularly in trade and cultural engagement.</p>  <p>  The Agreement commits Ireland and Cuba to promoting cooperation in many areas including economic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, academic, cultural, scientific and tourism relations.  Together with the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, this Memorandum will place the Ireland-Cuba relationship on a more forward-looking footing, and will give Ireland the means to engage more positively with Cuba, and to respond promptly and positively to future developments in the country.</p>  <p>  The President's visit was the first by an EU Head of State to Cuba since the signing in 2016 of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement.  I had the honour to sign this Agreement on behalf of Ireland, along with my EU colleagues and the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council on 12 December 2016.  As the Deputy will be aware, this is the first such agreement between the EU and Cuba.  Its signature marks a further positive step forward in relations between Cuba and the EU, which have improved considerably in recent years.  I believe that improvements in the EU-Cuba relationship will in turn have helpful consequences for the Ireland-Cuba relationship.</p>  <p>  In addition to both the EU-Cuba PDCA and the Ireland-Cuba Memorandum, there has been an increased frequency of contacts between Ireland and Cuba at official level in recent times, both directly from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and via our Embassy in Mexico which is accredited to Cuba.  Political consultations, led by the Secretary General of my Department, took place in 2015 and again en marge of the visit of the President last week.</p>  <p>  In relation to banking issues, my officials have in the past raised the difficulties that emerged, insofar as the extraterritorial application of US legislation is relevant, with the US side.  In response, the US have noted the concerns of banks everywhere to reduce risk in the face of heightened financial regulation and oversight.  They have stated that the US government does not direct financial institutions to maintain particular financial relationships and have recommended contact by relevant parties with the US Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Asset Control for information regarding Cuba-related transactions.  I am not aware of current difficulties being experienced by Irish citizens but would be glad to consider same if the Deputy wished to follow up with details.</p>  <p>  The enhanced relationship between the EU and Cuba as supported by the EU-Cuba PDCA, and the signature of the Memorandum of Cooperation between Ireland and Cuba last week, together provide a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with Cuba.  This strengthening of the bilateral relationship was cemented by the historic visit of President Higgins to Cuba.  I look forward to continued positive developments in the period ahead.</p></reply>

We recognise the positive steps that the new Government of Myanmar/Burma has taken in pursuit of peace and reconciliation, democratic reforms and economic growth.  I am however deeply concerned about the plight of the Rohingya people in Myanmar, as well as Rohingya refugees in neighbouring countries, particularly in light of the escalation of violence in Rakhine State in the wake of attacks on police posts near Myanmar/Burma&rsquo;s border with Bangladesh in October 2016.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently called for an independent investigation into the allegations of human rights violations by the security forces, as well as the need for the full restoration of humanitarian and media access to Rakhine State.  I note with serious concern the report of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which issued on 3 February, which outlined experiences of the Rohingya community who recently entered Bangladesh from Rakhine State.  I am also aware of the media reports, to which the deputy has referred, which indicate that two senior UN officials estimate that more than 1,000 Rohingya Muslims may have been killed by Myanmar security forces in their response to the October 2016 attacks.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in raising concerns regarding the treatment of the Rohingya community at bilateral level with the authorities in Myanmar/Burma and in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN.  Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Thailand, who is accredited to Myanmar/Burma, raised these concerns with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs U Kyaw Tin during a visit to the country in January 2017.  The Embassy continues to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also raised concerns regarding the situation of the Rohingya community in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN.  In 2016, Ireland supported the EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar/Burma at the 31st session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in March 2016.  This resolution conveyed the HRC&rsquo;s serious concerns over human rights violations in the country, including the situation in Rakhine State and particularly with respect to religious and ethnic minorities, including the Rohingya minority.  Ireland also raised this issue in a statement at the 32nd session of the HRC in June 2016 and during the review of Myanmar&rsquo;s human rights record at the HRC&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review in November 2015.  Ireland has also supported the inclusion of this issue in the EU&rsquo;s contact with the Government of Myanmar, including in the most recent EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue which took place on 22 November 2016.</p></reply>

Similarly, Vice-President Pence has said that he would be happy to continue the tradition of hosting a St Patrick&rsquo;s Day breakfast at the US Naval Observatory, while Speaker Paul Ryan has confirmed his intention of hosting the traditional Friends of Ireland lunch on Capitol Hill.</p>  <p>  Collectively, the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events in Washington provide invaluable opportunities for the Government to discuss, at the very highest levels with the US Administration, our priorities and concerns.  It is also an opportunity to inform the new Administration and Congress of issues of particular Irish interest, including immigration reform in the United States and the continuing need for vigilance on the Peace Process in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In our multifaceted bilateral relations with the United States, St Patrick&rsquo;s Day-related engagements represent a key annual opportunity to pursue Ireland&rsquo;s interests and concerns with the US Administration.  The events surrounding St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day also offer us the chance to reaffirm our longstanding relationship with a broad array of US stakeholders, based on shared values of democracy and the rule of law, as well as economic and historic ties.</p>  <p>  Whether or not the Middle East Peace Process features in those discussions will depend on developments between now and then.  While President Trump has made clear his preference for moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, his Administration has stated that it is studying the issue before making any announcement.  I also noted the President&rsquo;s comments following his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  It is unclear what these comments may mean in practice.  I and my Department follow these issues closely and will continue to do so.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the principles agreed to by all parties in the Stormont House Agreement of 2014, for dealing with the legacy of the past.</p>  <p>  The Government remains strongly committed to the establishment of the architecture for dealing with the legacy of the past that is provided for in the Stormont House Agreement.  This system provides a framework for dealing comprehensively with the legacy of the past in a way that can bring whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles.</p>  <p>  An effective and adequately resourced inquest system is an essential part of the system to provide for effective investigations into deaths during the Troubles, and this requirement is also recognised in the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  I am fully supportive of the proposals that were made by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland in February 2016.  In my engagement with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland, I have underlined the need to adequately resource the inquests system as proposed by the Lord Chief Justice, so that it can operate effectively and investigate outstanding legacy cases from the Troubles.</p>  <p>  I have also emphasised the right under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights to an effective investigation, which is a sovereign obligation that must be upheld by all responsible authorities.  In December 2016, I directed that Ireland advocate at the Council of Europe on the urgent need for progress on legacy issues in Northern Ireland, including a properly resourced legacy inquests system, so that the long-outstanding investigations can finally proceed in a manner that is compliant with Article 2 of the Convention.</p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland, as appropriate, to support the implementation of the Lord Chief Justice&rsquo;s proposals on legacy inquests and the establishment of the legacy institutions provided for under the Stormont House Agreement, as soon as possible.  The formation of a new power-sharing Executive following the election to be held on 2 March will, I hope, contribute to progress on these issues.</p></reply>

The core intention of the EU Turkey Statement is to break the business model of the people smugglers profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable and to discourage migrants from risking their lives in dangerous sea journeys. The period since the Statement was agreed has seen a very substantial reduction in the number of migrants risking their lives at sea and entering the EU from Turkey, which suggests that the Statement is achieving its aims.</p>  <p>  The need for the Statement to comply with EU and international law was a key concern for very many EU Member States, including Ireland. The legal advice of the EU institutions and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was that the terms of the Statement were not in breach of EU or international law.</p>  <p>  The European Council, the Justice and Home Affairs Council as well as the Foreign Affairs Council have all addressed the migration crisis on many occasions since the crisis developed in the Spring of 2015 and I have taken an active part in those discussions.</p>  <p>  Human rights and humanitarian values are at the core of the EU and Member States&rsquo; approach to all negotiations on migration and mobility and we are committed to enhancing human rights safeguards in such negotiations. </p>  <p>  Although the EU and Turkey are working well together to address the migrant crisis, the EU as a whole nonetheless has grave concerns about negative developments in Turkey in respect of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and freedom of expression, in the aftermath of the attempted coup in July 2016 and under the extended state of emergency, which is still in place. I share the concerns of our EU partners, which were set out very clearly in a statement on 8 November last. Unfortunately, these concerns persist. We will continue to monitor the situation in Turkey closely, and to engage with the Turkish authorities to encourage a renewed commitment to democracy and respect for human freedoms and to the core principles which we value so highly.  We do not underestimate the challenges faced by Turkey, or the role it plays in the migrant crisis, but believe that the rule of law and democracy must always be respected.</p></reply>

These crimes continue to this day, against Yazidis held captive by Da&rsquo;esh.  The protection of the Yazidi population and other populations from these crimes is a matter for the United Nations, in particular the Security Council of the United Nations, rather than the European Union.</p>  <p>  In September 2015, Ireland addressed UN Human Rights Council on the findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry report which stated that the crime of genocide had been committed against the Yazidis, saying &ldquo;the Commission&rsquo;s report details unimaginable crimes. The suffering of the victims of Daesh&rsquo;s terrorism and hatred is laid bare before this Council in the report. This Council and the membership of the United Nations have an inarguable duty to end these crimes and work to achieve justice and accountability for the victims of these crimes.</p>  <p>  Ireland has long made clear its full support for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Together with over 50 Member States of the United Nations, Ireland co-sponsored a proposed resolution to this effect in 2014. Ireland regards the failure of the proposed resolution as a breach of the Security Council&rsquo;s obligations under the UN Charter. Ireland repeats its call for the Security Council to uphold international law and act on this report by referring the situation in Syria to the Court. It is intolerable that the terrorist perpetrators of the most heinous crimes would be granted impunity by the action of any member of the United Nations.</p>  <p>  Ireland urges that all States engaged in countering Daesh in Syria and Iraq should place the protection of civilian populations, especially minorities at particular risk from Daesh&rsquo;s murderous ideology of hate, as a priority in their instructions to members of their security forces.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The responsibility for a legal determination of the crime of genocide is a matter for a legally competent and internationally recognised court. These atrocities took place in both Syria and Iraq and reported crimes in both States need to be investigated and prosecuted. I regard the report of the Commission of Inquiry and its findings of genocide as authoritative and I repeat our long-standing demand that the Security Council fulfil its obligations under international law and act to ensure that the Yazidis can seek accountability for Daesh&rsquo;s crimes before the International Criminal Court or another legally competent international tribunal. </p>  <p>  I welcome the December 2016 decision of the UN General Assembly to establish an independent, impartial independent accountability mechanism for Syria. Ireland was one of the large majority of States voting in favour of its establishment. Our Mission to the United Nations have reported on the steps taken to implement the decision and we will consider all options Ireland can take to give practical support to United Nations in ensuring its effectiveness. </p>  <p>  Funding from the Irish Aid programme, managed by my Department, has been provided to meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable people inside Iraq, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, and those who have been displaced internally, or who have fled to neighbouring countries. Funding is channelled through Irish Aid&rsquo;s NGO partners and UN organisations, who are best placed to respond, and is used to provide humanitarian supplies and urgently needed access to food, health, water and sanitation services, with a particular focus on the protection of children, women and the most vulnerable. </p>  <p>  Ireland provided almost &euro;3 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq during 2016. &euro;2.5 million was channelled through the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund, which is used to provide life-saving assistance and meet the critical humanitarian needs of the estimated 10 million people affected by violence in Iraq. In Erbil and Dahuk Governorates, in particular, this includes members of the Yazidi community.</p>  <p>  In addition the Irish Government dispatched 80 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies under the Rapid Response initiative. The relief items, which included blankets, jerry cans, cooking sets, water tanks, tarpaulins and shelter kits, at a total approximate value of &euro;462,813, were donated to Oxfam for distribution to conflict affected communities.</p>  <p>  During 2015, Ireland also provided &euro;1 million to the Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund and &euro;250,000 in support of UNICEF&rsquo;s Iraq Strategic Response Plan, which prioritised the protection of civilians displaced by conflict, as well as &euro;330,000 to Christian Aid Ireland to support activities promoting the protection of displaced women and girls in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, where the Yazidi population is concentrated.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to closely monitor the situation in Iraq, and given its complexity and severity, it is likely that further support will be provided to affected communities.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I share the concerns expressed by other EU partners regarding this development.  I have noted the clarification issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on 31 January, 2017, to the effect that the Executive Order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.  Since then, the US courts have intervened and imposed a suspension on the implementation of the Executive Order.</p>  <p>  I would like to advise the House that officials from my Department met with representatives of the United States Embassy in Dublin on 8 February last and were assured that no changes have been made with regard to US visa regulations governing the issuance of visas for recent graduates.  As the House may be aware, Irish students and recent graduates may avail of a range of options within the J1 programme.  In this regard, I am pleased to note the recent announcement by the US authorities confirming an increase of 2,600 in the number of placements available to Irish citizens in the Summer Work and Travel (SWT) programme for 2017.</p></reply>

Already this year, the issue has been discussed at both the January and February meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, and is expected to be on the agenda again in March. The background is a very troubling one of stagnation in the political process and worsening developments on the ground, but our efforts continue.</p>  <p>  Some remarks and suggestions by President Trump in relation to these issues have been widely publicised and may be unhelpful, but the policy of his administration remains to emerge. The advent of any new US Administration tends to introduce a period of uncertainty in relation to the Middle East Peace Process.</p>  <p>  For our part, Ireland and our EU colleagues remain fully committed to a two state solution to the conflict, as the only option which can meet the needs of both sides, however difficult it may be to achieve. This is also the overwhelming view of the international community, as expressed in the declaration of the Paris Conference which I attended in January.  The EU will continue to espouse and advance this approach, including in discussions with the United States.</p></reply>

Increasing volumes of aid are being allocated to respond to conflicts and crises and in support of addressing their root causes.  The EU and member States are responding to the refugee and migration crisis through new instruments, notably the Facility for Refugees in Turkey and the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. Ireland is committed to contributing some &euro;23 million between 2016 and 2019 to the Facility for Refugees.  It focuses on humanitarian assistance, migration management, education, health services and socio-economic support for refugees from the Syrian conflict.  The migration management element covers work to ensure that the transportation, reception and hosting of migrants returned from Greece to Turkey is carried out in a secure way in dignified conditions, and to avoid further humanitarian tragedies in the Aegean Sea. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to contributing &euro;3 million over five years, up to 2020, to the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. We work to ensure that the Fund addresses the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement, not least because it is financed overwhelmingly from the development and humanitarian budgets of the EU and member States.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme will continue to focus on ending extreme poverty, hunger and under nutrition by 2030.  Our aid will remain untied.  The OECD Development Assistance Committee in its review of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme stated that it is particularly impressive that the fight to reduce poverty remains firmly at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.</p></reply>

From our perspective this means, as the Taoiseach stated in his keynote speech last week, that the best possible outcome in the negotiations is &ldquo;the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the EU and the UK&rdquo;.  The Government&rsquo;s preparations for these negotiations have been extensive. But it is also critical that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe and are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s position for the forthcoming negotiations. To that end, an extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the European Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiations Task Force, is under way. To date, there has been over 120 engagements at either political or senior official level.   The Taoiseach is in regular contact with EU leaders and recently travelled to Madrid and Warsaw for meetings with his Spanish and Polish counterparts. [He will travel to Brussels later this week, where he will have a meeting with the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.]</p>  <p>  For my own part, I spoke with each of my EU Foreign Minister counterparts in the period immediately following the referendum in the UK. I then undertook a second round of discussions with my EU colleagues which most recently has included bilateral meetings with the Italian, Spanish and Finnish Foreign Ministers. [Today, I welcomed the French Foreign Minister to Dublin for discussions, and plans are advancing for a visit by my Luxembourg counterpart at the beginning of March.] Engagement with the European Commission&rsquo;s Task Force on Brexit and the Commission&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has also been a central part of the Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement. The Government&rsquo;s position on Brexit was outlined in meetings with Mr. Barnier in Dublin on 12 October. During a recent visit to Brussels (9 February) I met with Mr Barnier and had an excellent exchange with him about preparations for the negotiations phase. Engagement with the Commission&rsquo;s Task Force at a technical level has been regular and is ongoing. There have been a number of exchanges on key aspects of the negotiations process and the Irish-specific aspects, including on the Common Travel Area and on border issues. </p>  <p>  In the same vein, Minister of State Murphy also remains actively engaged; visiting Romania and Greece on 30 January to 1 February and this week he travels to Bratislava, Vienna and Budapest.  In addition, meetings at senior official level took place with Latvia, Lithuania and Belgium most recently, and engagements are scheduled with France, Poland and Slovakia in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Feedback to date from this comprehensive engagement has been very encouraging. There is as sound understanding among EU partners of our priority issues and a strong willingness and openness to work closely with Ireland on addressing them.  </p>  <p>  When the negotiations start, we, together with our EU partners, will face the UK across the negotiating table and will strive for a deal that everyone can accept but more importantly that protects Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests. There will be a need for the British Government to also factor into their negotiating position with the European Union their objectives in relation to the maintenance of the open border and the protection of the gains of the peace process in Northern Ireland, as underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. The Taoiseach discussed this imperative with Prime Minister May at their meeting on 30 January and I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire in our meeting on 14 February.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with all of our EU partners in pursuit of each of our four headline priorities, to protect the fundamental interests of our people and our economy.</p></reply>

In the aftermath of the referendum in the United Kingdom on 23 June 2016, there was a Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council on 4 July 2016 in Dublin Castle.  At that meeting the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to work closely together to optimise North South planning in the phases preceding and following the United Kingdom&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  It was also agreed that full sectorial audits would be carried out by Departments North and South to identify the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies which may arise following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal.  At the subsequent NSMC Plenary meeting on 18 November 2016 in Armagh the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed on a number of important common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis. </p>  <p>  It was also agreed that this work would be taken forward through continuing bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectorial level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.</p>  <p>  The Government remains engaged with the political parties in Northern Ireland and I would hope that the new Northern Ireland Executive will be in place soon after the Assembly election on 2 March and that dates for the next NSMC Plenary meeting will be agreed as soon as possible thereafter.  </p>  <p>  The Executive is responsible for politically representing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests, including in relation to the upcoming EU-UK negotiations.  With those negotiations expected to begin shortly, it is essential that Ministerial engagement through the NSMC recommences at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>  <p>  While the common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis have been agreed by the North South Ministerial Council it is one of a number of fora, alongside the British Irish Council and the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, within which it is possible to discuss with our colleagues from Northern Ireland the implications of Brexit.  In addition, the issue has been discussed and will continue to be discussed in bilateral contacts with the Northern Ireland Executive and political parties, as well as in the range of inter-governmental contacts between Dublin and London.  </p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to maintain those close contacts in the period ahead using all appropriate channels both formal and informal.</p></reply>

This meeting formed part of the Government&rsquo;s continued programme of extensive engagement with EU partners to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s unique set of priorities with regard to Brexit and the many complex issues relating to Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area and the depth of our trade relationship with the UK. Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with Mr Barnier and his taskforce at political and official level has been and continues to be very constructive. Dublin was one of the first capitals visited by Mr Barnier in his Brexit role and during his visit on 12 October last, in addition to my own bilateral meeting with him, he had very positive discussions with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State for European Affairs.  Our meeting on 9 February provided an opportunity to take stock of Ireland&rsquo;s regular and ongoing engagement with Mr Barnier&rsquo;s team on key aspects of the negotiations process and the Irish-specific aspects, including the Common Travel Area and on border issues. I also welcomed the fact that Mr Barnier has highlighted the need to address Ireland&rsquo;s specific concerns as a priority in the upcoming negotiations. </p>  <p>  I shared the Government&rsquo;s perspective on recent developments, including Prime Minister May&rsquo;s speech and the recent British Government White Paper. In this respect, I reiterated that we share the UK&rsquo;s objective of maintaining the Common Travel Area as it now stands. I also welcomed the UK&rsquo;s objective of achieving as close and frictionless a trade relationship as possible with the EU after it departs. </p>  <p>  I emphasised the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining this close engagement with Mr Barnier and his taskforce and that we will continue to work closely with the Commission team at political and official level as we address the particular challenges ahead.</p></reply>

I have been advised by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that, under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006), the RSA has responsibility for analysing the cause of road traffic fatalities.  I have requested a report from the RSA in this regard and will contact the Deputy directly immediately on receipt of the RSA's response. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that its 6 week 2016/2017 Christmas campaign resulted in a 35% increase in arrests over the same period in 2015 for &lsquo;driving under the influence&rsquo;.  This clearly illustrates that drink-driving remains a significant road safety issue in Ireland that needs to be addressed urgently.  Following a special meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Road Safety in January, Minister Ross announced that his Department would review section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with the intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will, in future, receive a mandatory disqualification.</p>  <p>  I support Minister Ross's intention to amend section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which should assist us in ensuring more effective enforcement of road traffic offences and making our roads safer.  My Department will continue to assist the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport  in bringing these changes forward.</p></reply>

Every person refused leave to land in the State is served with a notice in which the reason, or reasons, for refusing an application for permission to enter the State is set out.  I would also advise the Deputy that persons refused leave to land and who are subsequently removed from the State are returned to their point of embarkation, which in most cases is within the EU. </p>  <p>  The total number of persons refused leave to land at approved ports of entry to the State in 2016 was 4,127.  Of these, the top five nationalities were as follows, Brazilian &ndash; 533; Albanian &ndash; 446; South African &ndash; 329; United States &ndash; 266 and Pakistan &ndash; 180.  The further breakdown of nationalities requested by the Deputy is not readily available and would require the search and retrieval of individual records that could only be obtained by the disproportionate expenditure of time and resources relative to the information sought. </p>  <p>  A breakdown by port of entry requested by the Deputy is as follows: Cork Airport &ndash; 113; Dublin Airport &ndash; 3,370; Dublin Port &ndash; 142; Dun Laoghaire &ndash; 1; Rosslare Port &ndash; 98; Shannon Airport &ndash; 56.</p>  <p>  The information sought in respect of Iraq, Syria and Eritrea has been provided to the Deputy in response to PQ No. 100 of 31st January, 2017.  The corresponding numbers for Yemen, Libya and Iran were 7, 7 and 46 respectively.  </p>  <p>  The number of persons refused leave to land here who were subsequently allowed to enter as asylum seekers in 2016 totalled 396.  I do not propose to disaggregate these figures further as I have a legal obligation to protect the identify of all asylum seekers in accordance with the International Protection Act 2015.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that information on numbers refused permission to enter the State may be subject to revision over time where individual cases are examined further and the status of some cases may change.</p></reply>

In circumstances where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will maintain a presence at our ports to continue their crucial policing role in protecting our borders from a security and law enforcement perspective, one of the requirements of further civilianisation at other ports of entry will be to achieve the appropriate balance between Garda&iacute; and civilian staff.

As the Deputy is aware, when concerns were raised in 2011 with regard to allegations about the conduct of a UK police officer operating undercover in Ireland, a report on the issues arising was sought from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The report from the then Garda Commissioner was received in March 2011 and outlined the position in respect of the basis on which intelligence-gathering co-operation from police services in other jurisdictions might be sought in certain circumstances.  The report also emphasised that confidentiality would be a fundamental aspect of any such arrangements.  As the Deputy will appreciate this would be fundamental to the use of such techniques were they to be deployed and would be essential to guard against harm to individuals.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously to the Deputy, these are operational matters for the Garda Authorities, that are carried out in accordance with their functions as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts, and neither I nor my Department would be involved in or have access to the details of such arrangements.</p>  <p>  In the light of developments which have taken place outside this jurisdiction since these matters came to light in 2011, including the establishment in 2015 by the UK Government of an inquiry into undercover policing in England and Wales since 1968 (the Pitchford Inquiry), I requested a fresh report from the Garda Commissioner on any issues arising.  As I have stated previously to the Deputy, I have not sought in any way to circumscribe the information which the Garda Commissioner would provide in that report.  I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that they have met with their London Metropolitan Police Service counterparts and they will remain in ongoing contact with them in respect of this issue. </p></reply>

The Board has always interpreted the word &lsquo;persons&rsquo; to mean natural persons only and not to include legal persons (e.g. a company).  Section 29(1) of the Act requires that a person satisfy certain financial eligibility criteria set out in Regulations. The financial eligibility criteria that are set out in the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 &ndash; 2013 clearly contemplate a natural person&rsquo;s income and resources being assessed and do not contemplate the assessment being in relation to a legal person.  </p><p>My Department is in regular contact with officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on cross-Departmental matters and the situation in regard to legal aid of the nature referred to by the Deputy will be kept under review.</p></reply>

I would also like to assure the Deputy that the Chairperson and members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Interim Chief Executive and my Department are working closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of the necessary steps and commencements by the Department, and the delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned. This will include key milestones such as the coming on stream of the new public complaints and professional conduct provisions contained in Part 6 of the 2015 Act which are a bedrock of the new regulatory regime. It will also include the compilation, within a six-month period, of the new Roll of Practising Barristers which forms the basis, for the first time in legislation, for the regulation of barristers. Underlying all of these matters is the fact that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been established, in the public interest, as an independent regulator in terms of both its appointment and the discharge of its functions. This protects the independence of the legal professions and of the courts as well as the interests and confidentiality of legal clients. It is important in this context that the Regulatory Authority be afforded a reasonable opportunity to deliver its mandate efficiently and effectively and, most importantly, with the necessary working supports in place. While it remains the intention that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be in substantive regulatory mode later this year, the phased start-up of its various functions along the lines I have expressed will need careful project management. This will involve setting, over the next six weeks or so and in conjunction with the Authority, the specific target dates for the delivery of the various functions involved.   </p></reply>

I am informed that the findings of the Serious Crime Review Team indicate that the murder was comprehensively investigated at the time and that no new evidence that might open further avenues of investigation has been presented.  A number of persons faced prosecution in respect of this murder but none was convicted and it remains a matter of regret that it has not proved possible to bring anyone to justice in this case.</p>  <p>  I would urge that if any person is in the possession of new or previously undisclosed information that might advance the investigation of this crime, it should be brought immediately to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order that it may be properly investigated.</p>  <p>  I am aware that family members of the victim have met and corresponded with the Serious Crime Review Team on several occasions in the course of its work on this case.

However, and as set out in the action plan, while I have no plans for additional tax incentive schemes targetted specifically at the owners of property in rural towns and villages, the Deputy may be aware of a number of tax incentives that are already available to the owners of residential property in all areas, including rural towns and villages.</p>  <p>  The Home Renovation Incentive provides for an income tax credit for homeowners or landlords of residential property, who carry out repair, renovation or improvement works on their property.  It provides for tax relief by way of an income tax credit of 13.5% of qualifying expenditure.  Qualifying work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (including VAT).  The maximum qualifying cost for the purpose of the incentive is (&euro;30,000 including VAT), which equates to a maximum credit of &euro;4,050.  The tax credit is payable over two years following the year in which the work is paid for and I have extended the scheme for a further two years in the recent Budget. </p>  <p>  In addition, (limited) relief is available for expenditure on approved gardens and buildings in the state in accordance with Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  To qualify for this relief the relevant building must be determined by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to be of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that reasonable access to the building is afforded to the public.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Help to Buy incentive is designed to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required to purchase or build their first home.  With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief is available in respect of 'new builds'.  There are a range of conditions that a first time buyer must meet in order to qualify for Help to Buy incentive, including taking out a mortgage of at least 70% of the value of the purchase price, or in the case of a self-build, 70% of the valuation approved by the mortgage provider.</p></reply>

The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  The demographic data for the Swords school planning area is currently under review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases in this area. </p>  <p>  In relation to capacity in the area, as the Deputy may be aware, there are 13 primary schools serving the Swords area, five of which have had new state-of-the-art buildings provided since 2008. Two of the primary schools are included in the current capital programme and a number of the other schools have undertaken smaller extensions via my Department&rsquo;s Additional Accommodation Scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently been in direct contact with a number of primary schools in the area in respect of their junior infant capacity.  In that regard, it is understood that at least one school is undersubscribed and has expressed a willingness to enrol further junior infants in September 2017, if necessary.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is important that school size is monitored and that a balance is preserved among all schools in school planning areas to ensure that one school is not expanding at the expense or the viability of another school.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to keep developments in the area under review in the context of the ongoing demographic analysis.</p></reply>

If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or a school they should contact the relevant school authorities. The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies. Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints in relation to schools provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative impact on a child.

The draft legislation defines the principles that will guide how schools will engage with students and parents.  </p>  <p>  Following consultation with our education partners, including the National Parents Council (Primary), National Parents Council (Post Primary) and the Irish Second-level Students Union, I will finalise national guidelines on a Parent and Student Charter.  </p>  <p>  The draft Bill has now gone to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for pre-legislative scrutiny. On 12 December 2016, I wrote to the Chairperson of the Committee requesting that the Committee might consider carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny on the General Scheme of an Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill simultaneously with Deputy Jim Daly's Private Members Bill regarding the establishment of an Ombudsman for Education.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy. </p><p>A key element of the DEIS Plan 2017 is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.  </p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation.This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at </p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage. </p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie</p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017, we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

There are various deadlines for meeting the requirements of the Directive, one of which was the requirement for secondary treatment to be provided for all agglomerations which discharge to freshwaters and estuaries and have a population equivalent of greater than 2,000 by 31 December 2005.</p>  <p>  A first letter of formal notice, issued in September 2013, signalled that the European Commission had commenced an infringement process against Ireland regarding its implementation of the Directive. This was followed by a supplementary letter of formal notice in September 2015.  A Reasoned Opinion was issued on 30 September 2016, with the Commission deciding to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the EU on 15 February 2017.</p>  <p>  The supplementary letter of formal notice of September 2015 identified compliance concerns around a total of 82 agglomerations.  Ireland has satisfied the Commission, through their responses to date, that 44 agglomerations should be removed from the case.  This demonstrates that considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues. However, 38 agglomerations remain of concern to the Commission and have now been referred to the Court.   </p>  <p>  Since taking over responsibility for water services on 1 January 2014, Irish Water has put in place a prioritised range of projects to deal with the historic deficits and lack of investment in waste water collection and treatment across the country.  Irish Water has identified key projects, in both their current and recently approved future capital investment plans, to address all non-compliances in their waste water treatment plants by 2021 for each of the areas identified by the Commission in this ECJ case.  The cost of these works is estimated at &euro;1 billion.</p>  <p>  However, further significant and sustained investment will be essential to ensure ongoing compliance, to cater for growth and to provide waste water services that protect the environment and meet our obligations under the directive.</p>  <p>  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email at oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

A copy of the form used for complaints to the Courts regarding barking is available from local authorities.  The Court may make an order, requiring the occupier of the premises in which the dog is kept to abate the nuisance by exercising due control over the dog.  The Court may also limit the number of dogs that can be kept on a premises or may direct that the dog be delivered to a dog warden to be dealt with as an unwanted dog.  I have no plans to amend the legislation in this area.  While complaints in relation to barking dogs are largely dealt with under the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts, the position in relation to noise nuisance generally is that a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.

The proposed action, which was also reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government published in May 2016, is indicative of the ambitious priority attached to urban regeneration by the Government, is one of a series of specific actions to facilitate the regeneration of our urban centres, many of which were adversely impacted by the economic downturn. The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness- Rebuilding Ireland, published in July 2016, further reinforces the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the area of urban regeneration.</p>  <p>  To drive forward consideration and implementation of these actions, a Working Group, which I chair and which also involves senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and other relevant actors, has been established to bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures as early as possible.  It is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration activities under my Department's Social Housing Capital Programme, as well as other social regeneration initiatives already underway. As part of its deliberations, the Working Group is also evaluating the use of the derelict sites legislation to address the problem of dereliction in many urban centres.  I expect the Working Group to be in a position to report in Q2 2017, the results of which will inform a review of the derelict sites legislation by the final quarter of 2017, as envisaged in the Action Plan for Rural Development.</p></reply>

While the development and implementation of an allocation scheme is a matter for the housing authority concerned, being a reserved function of the elected members, Section 22(17) of the 2009 Act provides that the Minister may issue directions to a housing authority regarding the operation of an allocation scheme and the housing authority shall comply with any such direction in operating the scheme.  In this regard, a Ministerial Direction was put in place in January 2015 which required the Dublin Region housing authorities to allocate at least 50% of tenancies under their control to homeless and other vulnerable households.  The Direction was subsequently renewed on two occasions, with the last renewal expiring on 30 April 2016.   </p>  <p>  At the time of the last renewal in February 2016, the Housing Agency was requested to conduct a review of the operation of the Direction and provide an impartial assessment.</p>  <p>  The Agency recommended that the Direction should be allowed to lapse upon its expiry. </p>  <p>  This Direction was only ever intended to operate for a short period of time to provide an immediate increase in the number of social housing tenancies being allocated to homeless households. In the normal course, local authorities and their elected members are best placed to determine the allocation of social housing for their own areas, in line with national policy.   </p>  <p>  Among the Agency&rsquo;s findings was that the well-established allocation procedures of housing authorities are capable of responding to particular housing need without an on-going Ministerial Direction.  This analysis is vindicated by the fact that during 2016 local authorities nationally achieved in the region of 2,700 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies; this is a record level of exits, with the comparable figure for 2015 having been 2,300. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the Housing Agency's report, my predecessor decided not to renew the Ministerial Direction after 30 April 2016 and I do not propose to revisit the issue.  I am confident that the comprehensive range of actions and initiatives underway to increase housing supply generally, as set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, will enable local authorities to prioritise appropriately the level of housing allocations to homeless households and other vulnerable groups achieved under the Direction.</p></reply>

It is important that they utilise all opportunities to develop new social housing but the mix will increasingly switch towards construction on foot of the substantial pipeline of projects now in place.  I continue to keep all of the social housing delivery mechanisms under review to ensure that they remain relevant and are meeting housing needs in a cost effective and value-for-money way.</p></reply>

My Department does not have any plans at present to collate such data.</p>  <p>  On 16 December 2014, a statutory direction was issued to all authorities involved in the HAP scheme instructing then to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through a transfer option.

This included a discussion regarding the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund and the City Council&rsquo;s submission for the Ballymun area.</p>  <p>  At the meeting, I clearly outlined that the aim of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund is to relieve critical infrastructural blockages to enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites and to improve the economic viability of new housing projects in Dublin and in urban areas with high demand for housing. The &euro;200 m Fund comprises an Exchequer allocation of &euro;150 million, matched by a &euro;50 million contribution from participating local authorities.</p>  <p>  Twenty-one local authorities have submitted a total of 74 project applications relating to specific sites or development land areas. A proposal has been submitted by Dublin City Council in relation to the provision of road infrastructure in Ballymun.</p>  <p>  The viability of the applications is currently being examined in detail against the assessment criteria set out in the Call for Proposals, with a focus on the level of funding required and what it might leverage, the number of housing units that could be delivered, their strategic location and speed of delivery, and affordability levels of a proportion of the homes.

It is the role of the staff of these services to provide Jobseekers with a range of practical supports and assistance to help them enter/re-enter employment. The range of supports provided relate to the jobseekers preparation for, search for, the securing of and the sustaining of employment in the open labour market.</p>  <p>  With JobPath the department has procured additional resources to enable it to provide a high quality case managed employment support service to people who are long term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  The JobPath service was designed to augment and complement the Department&rsquo;s existing employment service capacity, including that provided by LES and Job Club contractors.  The additional capacity provided through the JobPath service has allowed the department to provide the type and intensity of services required by Jobseekers, particularly those most distant from the labour market.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of Intreo and JobPath the Department had a case officer to live register ratio of approximately 1,500:1 compared to international benchmarks of less than 200:1.  Today with the reduction in the unemployment rate and the increase in capacity, both internally through Intreo and externally through JobPath, the ratio is circa 230:1.  Nevertheless with a ratio of 230:1 as compared with international norms of less than 200:1 JobPath continues to play a key role in the delivery of the services required by Jobseekers.</p>  <p>  The JobPath service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period mid-2015 to July 2016, as a result the first groups of participants have only recently completed their engagement period with the service.  It is important to note, that through the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases. During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work. During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  It will take time therefore to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  However for 2017, the Department will publish a report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis, with the first such report having just been published recently (17th of January).</p>  <p>  The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging.</p>  <p>- Employment outcome data shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were 23% more likely to have started a job (as of October 2016).  The difference appears to be more marked for very long-term unemployed people, with those out of work for more than three years some 44% more likely to have found a job if they engaged with the service.</p>  <p>- The results from the first independently conducted customer satisfaction survey indicates that jobseekers feel that they are receiving a good service under JobPath (76 &ndash; 81% satisfaction vs 5 &ndash; 8% dissatisfaction), that the staff of the service make them feel valued (90%+) and they have a good relationship with their personal adviser (90%+). They also feel that the service has improved their chances of getting a job (68% - 77%).</p>  <p>  Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement period with the service these results can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless they are encouraging.</p>  <p>  As the number of people who have completed their engagement period with the service increases the department will be in a position to provide greater granularity in the reports to be published each quarter this year.</p>  <p>  The first report (with results together with a copy of the independent customer satisfaction survey findings for both companies) is available on the department&rsquo;s website at &ndash; www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/JobPath-performance-report-January-2017.pdf.</p></reply>

This includes programmes such as Community Employment (CE) and Rural Social Scheme (RSS).</p>  <p>  These schemes help to break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  My Department is also conscious of the valuable contribution the schemes are making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  CE Sponsors advertise CE vacancies free-of-charge on the Department's JobsIreland website, www.jobsireland.ie.  Posting vacancies is a relatively simple process and a dedicated video tutorial is available on the site to assist sponsors.  Anyone requiring further assistance can contact my Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre by phone at Lo Call 1890 800 024 or (01) 248 1398, or by email at jobsireland@welfare.ie.  Further enhancements will be made to the way in which CE vacancies are displayed on the site in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Jobseekers can view CE vacancies online.  Eligible candidates are referred to sponsors by case officers in the local Intreo Centres.  My Department continues to refer candidates so I would advise sponsors who may be experiencing particular recruitment difficulties to contact their local DSP Intreo office with any concerns they may have in that regard.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for participation on the RSS is limited to those in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments and all participants must also be actively engaged in farming or fishing.</p>  <p>  The JobPath service is provided for jobseekers only.  The period of engagement with JobPath for any individual is typically 52 weeks.  During that time, they receive intensive individual support to help them overcome barriers to employment and are also provided with a range of training and development supports, including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  During the year, if a person is placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to an additional twelve months while in employment.</p>  <p>  In general - and JobPath is no exception - job-seekers are not allowed to participate in two employment activation supports at the same time.  Given the need to manage the allocation of places effectively, my Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another scheme.  Participation in other schemes remains an option once a person completes their JobPath engagement.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, as the Integrated Ticketing System has limited roll-out across transport operators at present, the precise data requested by the Deputy is not currently available to my Department.  The full roll-out of the free travel variant of Public Services Card will allow for more comprehensive data to be collected on usage or non-usage of free travel when all transport operators have implemented the Integrated Ticketing System.  It is important to note however, that if a customer is issued with a free travel pass and does not use it there is no cost to my Department apart from the administrative cost of issuing the pass and maintaining records. </p>  <p>  Payments to private travel operators are determined by way of a survey of their passenger numbers at a given point in time.  New private operators seeking to enter the free travel scheme or existing private free travel operators seeking an increase in their payments must go through the survey process.  Where surveys of operators have not been undertaken in recent years my Department has asked operators to put such surveys in train as part of its control and review strategy.</p>  <p>  In addition to the surveys my Department carries out periodic inspections of private operators within the free travel scheme.  The inspections are a means of monitoring the scheme to ensure compliance with my Department&rsquo;s requirements and to confirm information already held on file in relation to operators, routes and schedules.  If an operator is found, in the course of an inspection, not to be complying fully with the terms of their agreement, the matter is referred to the National Transport Authority, who is the licensing authority. </p>  <p>  My Department makes a block payment to the CIE Group in respect of transport services provided nationwide by the Group and the apportionment of payment between the three constituent companies, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is a matter for the CIE Group to determine. </p>  <p>  In relation to CIE, rather than carrying out specific surveys of usage, my Department moved to a service model based on the transportation infrastructure and the introduction of new services e.g. LUAS and removal of the restrictions on free travel during peak hours.  At each stage, my Department has negotiated rates and discounts to reflect these developments.  Payments for LUAS were calculated on the basis of ridership and ticket survey information. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to maintaining the Free Travel scheme and there are no plans to make any changes to customer eligibility for the scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 874,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;80 million.</p>  <p>  The All Ireland free travel scheme was introduced in April 2007.  The scheme allows a free travel pass holder (those aged 66 and older) to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services within Northern Ireland using a senior smartpass card.  Similarly, Northern Ireland senior smartpass holders (aged 65 years or older) are entitled to travel for free on services in Ireland using their existing senior smartpass card.  </p>  <p>  This is a bilateral arrangement, and does not apply to other parts of the EU.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that the current arrangements with regard to the All-Ireland free travel scheme are not affected for some time to come.  The future operation of arrangements will, of course, be determined as part of the complex process of negotiating the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU.  </p>  <p>  Clearly, a key area of concern is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social security schemes and services between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.  This, of course, includes the arrangements for All Ireland free travel scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government's long-term objective is to ensure that the reciprocity of civic rights which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area [CTA], are safeguarded and maintained.  I have strongly emphasised the importance of this issue in my meetings with the UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the Right Hon. Damian Green, M.P. on 2nd February 2017 and with Mr Damian Hinds, Minister for Employment, UK Department of Work and Pensions at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council [EPSCO] on 8 December 2016.

Previously, councillors paid PRSI at the Class K rate of 4% on their income as public office holders, provided that income exceeded &euro;5,200 per annum.  Payment of Class K by councillors was not reckonable towards establishing entitlement to social insurance pensions and benefits. </p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Act came into effect on 1 January 2017 via the Social Welfare Act 2016 (Section 10) (Commencement) Order 2016 (S.I.

These Regulations, which also came into effect on 1 January 2017, provided that members of a local authority would continue to pay a 4% charge on their income, but, on the basis of paying Class S, they would be now be entitled to access the same social insurance benefits available to self-employed people. </p>  <p>  Therefore, all the necessary statutory instruments in relation to this matter have been signed. </p>  <p>  Payment of S Class contributions provides entitlement to a range of benefits, subject to satisfying the contribution conditions for these schemes.  These include state pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory) as well as maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.

Ireland expressed its serious concerns with this legislation in the form of a direct intervention at a meeting of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg on 1 February, and through an EU Statement at a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna on 16 February, both of which were attended by representatives of the Russian government.

This support has been based on clear reasoning and analysis of the various options and alternatives, and those reasons remain valid, despite growing concerns about the possibility of achieving such a solution.</p>  <p>  The inescapable fact is that a two state outcome remains better than any other model that has been considered, and is the only one which can deliver peace, security, freedom and justice for both Israeli and Palestinian peoples. </p>  <p>  An acceptable one state outcome could only be on the basis of full equality between all those living under its jurisdiction.  Any belief that it will be possible instead to simply continue a version of the present occupation would be wholly unacceptable. </p>  <p>  The recent remarks of President Trump have stepped back from the clear support for the two state solution which previous Presidents have given, but without putting an alternative view in its place.  The Administration has yet to enunciate a considered policy for the Middle East. I hope very much that when it does so, it will recognise the logic which has guided US policy for many years.</p>  <p>  For our part, the European Union has made clear that our support and advocacy for a two state solution remain unaltered.  The strong international consensus on this basis was expressed only last month at the Paris Conference, which I attended, and in Security Council Resolution 2334 in December.

I expect this new service to start rolling out in the coming months.  The on-line option will initially be available for routine renewal of adult passports but it will be extended in phases to all applicants, including first-time applicants and children, by 2019.  The benefits in terms of shorter turnaround times, greater convenience coupled with more predictability, including for citizens overseas, will be considerable as will the efficiency gains for the Passport Service.  As the up-take of the on-line service grows the efficiencies will assist my Department in managing the significant increases in demand for passports that we have seen of late and which are likely to continue.</p></reply>

As well as raising individual cases with concerned countries, we also support the participation of human rights defenders in multilateral fora, including the Human Rights Council in Geneva.  We have been concerned for some time at the increasing trend of governments to prevent human rights defenders from engaging with the UN and by reports that some have been punished and even imprisoned on return from participation in meetings of the Human Rights Council.  As a member of the Human Rights Council, Ireland prioritised the role of civil society and took the lead on a resolution in 2013 which addressed this issue for the first time as a human rights concern and called on states to create an maintain a safe and enabling environment for civil society.  </p>  <p>  We have continued to follow this issue very closely following the conclusion of our term on the Human Rights Council.  At its 32nd session in July 2016, Ireland led negotiations which resulted in the adoption of a further resolution on civil society space which, among other measures, called on the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a report compiling information on the procedures and practices in respect of civil society involvement with regional and international organisations, including United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes.  It is expected that this report will be presented to the Human Rights Council at its 35th session in July 2017.</p>  <p>  While the accreditation of participants to Human Rights Council meetings in Geneva is ultimately a matter for the UN Office in Geneva and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ireland has actively supported the position that civil society actors, including human rights defenders, should be free to participate in such meetings without fear of reprisals.  Ireland is a member of a core group, together with Fiji, Ghana, Hungary and Uruguay, which will deliver a joint statement at the next meeting of the Human Rights Council in March welcoming the mandate given to the Assistant Secretary General of the UN for Human Rights to receive, consider and respond to allegations of intimidation and reprisals against human rights defenders and other civil society actors engaging with the UN.  We strongly believe that this long awaited and important development will ensure a more systematised and coordinated response to this issue of concern and help to put an end to intimidation and reprisals against those cooperating with the UN on human rights issues.</p></reply>

It does this primarily through the UN Security Council which has a variety of tools at its disposal to address threats to international peace and to contribute towards the resolution of conflicts: it has the power to deploy peacekeeping and political missions, to authorise military action and to impose sanctions against non-compliant States. Ireland is convinced that the principle of multilateralism upon which the UN is founded offers the best approach to address conflict and crisis situations.  At the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, Ireland endorsed the UN&rsquo;s commitments to help improve the humanitarian system so it can better respond to the needs of those affected by crises.  This reform places affected people at the centre of all humanitarian action, to better ensure their protection.  A coordinated humanitarian response is vital for the protection of civilians to ensure the most vulnerable receive the assistance they require, through safe and secure channels.  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) plays a key role in strengthening the humanitarian system and improving international humanitarian coordination during emergencies.  In 2016, Ireland provided &euro;4.5 million of core funding to UNOCHA.  Ireland also provided &euro;12.75 million to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and just over &euro;28 million to Country Based Pooled Funds (CBPFs) which are managed by UNOCHA.  </p>  <p>  The protection of vulnerable communities in emergencies is an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian action.  In addition to ensuring the humanitarian response is coordinated and safe, we provide support to UN agencies best placed to respond to those in need of protection services.  In 2016 Ireland provided over &euro;2.4 million to UNICEF for their work under the No Lost Generation initiative, which is dedicated to providing education and protection programmes to Syrian children and youth affected by the Syria crisis, both inside Syria and in the neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  However, we recognise that, in addition to the UN&rsquo;s many successes and achievements, there have also been failures, and the need for the protection of the fundamental well-being of civilians caught up in conflicts remains a priority.  The ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa illustrate clearly the importance of the UN enhancing its capacity to respond more effectively to conflict and the associated need for humanitarian protection.  </p>  <p>  The blockages at the Security Council in recent years have prevented the international community from acting together in a way that would allow civilians in conflict zones to be afforded greater protection.  Ireland is of the view that, in addition to the terrible consequences for civilian populations, including children, this inaction has resulted in considerable damage to the standing of the Security Council.  </p>  <p>  As a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group of states, Ireland advocates for reforms to the membership and working methods of the Security Council, including the use of the veto which, on some occasions, has led to inaction by the Security Council at critical moments.  </p>  <p>  While decisions of the Security Council, which are key to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the welfare of civilians in conflict zones, are the preserve of Member States, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres, who took office on 1 January, has announced a number of reform measures aimed at improving the management of the peace and security work of the UN Secretariat.  </p>  <p>  These measures include steps to remove structural and administrative barriers to better integrate the work of staff whose jobs address situations in conflict zones.  Mr. Guterres, whose own work as UN High Commissioner for Refugees from 2005-2015 gives him a particularly clear insight into the scale of the humanitarian crises facing the world, is to focus on the implementation of recommendations from three major peace and security reviews which were completed in 2015. Ireland engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform.  We will continue to engage on these reviews in the period ahead.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for reform of the UN to ensure that it is equipped to fulfil its critical role in the prevention, reduction or resolution of conflict, and also for the protection of civilians who are trapped in the many humanitarian crises arising from conflicts.</p></reply>

Information was also circulated to all Oireachtas members.  It should be noted that the turnaround times which are advised, including those for the An Post Passport Express service, are not a service guarantee.  The Passport Service website advises customers how to avoid the stress and inconvenience of having passport applications processed at the last moment.  The key points are to:</p><p>- check the validity of passports before booking a holiday,</p><p>- remember that children&rsquo;s passports vary in length of validity,</p><p>- as a matter of best practice, apply at least six weeks before the intended date of travel (passport applications can often be delayed if applications are incomplete and this timeframe allows for such an occurrence),</p><p>- choose the most appropriate application channel depending on the date of travel (this point is crucial),</p><p>- if travelling in three weeks or more (15 working days) the Passport Express channel is the cheapest and most convenient and cost effective option,</p><p>- if travelling in three weeks or less an appointment for the Passport Office in Dublin or Cork should be made online at www.passportappointments.ie.</p><p>To respond to the ongoing increase in applications and peak season demand, the Passport Service has recruited over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers to assist with checking and processing applications and to deal with customer care queries, through the phones, email and other media channels.

Foreign Ministers remain focused on implementation of the Council Conclusions on Counter-terrorism agreed in February 2015 and on the contribution that the EU can make through external action to preventing and countering terrorism.  Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, is at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s strategy and is reflected in a substantial increase in assistance to third countries in this respect.  The EU has placed considerable emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood: Western Balkans, Turkey, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries.  Actions include finalising Counter-Terrorism action plans with Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey, expanding the EU Counter Terrorism experts&rsquo; network to the Sahel and Western Balkans, and focusing on preventive action on conflict and violent extremism prevention priorities identified through the EU Early Warning process.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by, and is consistent with, the approach taken by the UN to countering terrorism and by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2161 (2014) on freezing funds and other assets of terrorist groups, and UNSCR 2178 (2014) on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State to plan or carry out terrorist acts or training.</p>  <p>  The former UN Secretary General&rsquo;s comprehensive Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, presented in January last year, and his related reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by international terrorism, and to highlighting the need to address drivers of violent extremism through dialogue and conflict prevention, strengthening governance and the rule of law, gender equality and empowering women, community engagement and youth empowerment, and education and skills development. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU and UN levels level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Council, I have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  I have emphasised the need to ensure a joined-up approach in relation to the discussions of Foreign Ministers and those of our Justice and Home Affairs counterparts with a view to a coordinated and comprehensive response to terrorism that can help ensure the safety of citizens abroad and in Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance is targeted where needs are greatest and we ensure a focus on crises and conflicts that are sometimes ignored in the media.  In 2016, Ireland provided over &euro;165 million in humanitarian funding, to provide assistance to people affected by crisis and conflict around the world including in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, South Sudan and north east Nigeria.  Ireland will maintain these funding levels for 2017.  Ireland also contributes to the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian action outside the EU, which has an annual budget of approximately &euro;1 billion.  Ireland&rsquo;s UN partners lead the coordination of international appeals for humanitarian assistance, including through the Central Emergency Response Fund.  Ireland is the eighth largest donor to this Fund, which has provided $3.7 billion in life-saving assistance since 2006.</p>  <p>  In May last year, the UN Secretary General convened the World Humanitarian Summit in an effort to address the current scale of global humanitarian crisis.  At the Summit, I delivered Ireland&rsquo;s National Statement, making a number of specific commitments to sustainable and effective humanitarian action, including through our support to conflict affected states and our approach to peacekeeping.  Ireland has also signed up to the Grand Bargain principles, accepting a series of commitments to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of humanitarian funding. </p>  <p>  Providing safe havens within conflict zones is extremely difficult, especially where civilian protection is not prioritised. Safe havens require UN mandates and robustly equipped peacekeeping personnel.  Political will is lacking in many conflicts today, including from some on the UN Security Council.  However, in other places, the UN is active and there are twice as many UN peacekeepers deployed today as 15 years ago.  Ireland continues to play its part, with more than 570 personnel in UN-mandated missions overseas.</p></reply>

In the wake of the Brexit vote, EU leaders met in Bratislava last September.  In the Bratislava Declaration they acknowledged the need to improve communications among Member States, with EU institutions, &ldquo;but most importantly with our citizens&rdquo;.  They agreed on the need to inject more clarity into decisions; use clear and honest language and to focus on citizens&rsquo; expectations.  EU leaders will gather in Rome next month to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.  They are expected to acknowledge the reality of eurosceptism, and the need to address it, including as set out in the Bratislava Declaration.  They are also likely to display a strong unity of purpose; to assert that the Continent&rsquo;s future peace and prosperity is best preserved and promoted through the European Union, and that the European Union, as a community of values, founded on the Rule of Law, democracy and human rights, is and will remain a bastion of these values in the world.</p></reply>

As the formal notification of departure under Article 50 has not yet occurred &ndash; although we expect it to take place next month in line with the UK&rsquo;s stated intention &ndash; to date no negotiation has taken place between the EU and the United Kingdom.  For our part, the Government continues to engage closely with the UK government and the devolved administrations and of course more broadly with Northern Ireland, including through the All-Island Civic Dialogue.  The Taoiseach met with Prime Minister May last July and more recently in January this year.  I have met with the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the EU and his Parliamentary Under Secretary, as well as the UK Foreign Secretary and on a number of occasions, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  There have also been very constructive discussions at political and official level within the framework of the British Irish Council.</p>  <p>  We have used these opportunities in recent months and weeks to address key bilateral points, while at the same time working with our EU partners and the EU Institutions.  We have categorically not entered into any wider discussion or negotiations on Brexit with the UK; we have been clear from the outset with the British, that Ireland is part of the EU27 side for this process.</p>  <p>  At EU27 level, the last formal discussion of Brexit took place among EU leaders in December, when a number of steps were agreed to handle the negotiation process that would follow the triggering of Article 50.  In accordance with these steps, it is agreed that after the formal notification of departure, the EU27 Heads of State and Government will meet to agree and adopt guidelines defining the framework for the negotiations.  The General Affairs Council will then adopt more detailed negotiating directives and will authorise the opening of the negotiations.  </p>  <p>  The guidelines and negotiating directives will be updated as necessary in the course of the negotiations.  The European Commission will be the Union negotiator for the EU27 and its team, which will include a representative of the rotating Presidency, will be led by Michel Barnier.  The aim is to agree all of these steps as soon as possible in the weeks following the triggering of Article 50, with the objective of starting negotiations proper with the United Kingdom in May/June.</p>  <p>  The Government is very clear on Irish priorities in the forthcoming negotiations: to protect our economic interests; to protect the Good Friday Agreement; to maintain the Common Travel Area with the UK;  to ensure an invisible border; and to maintain the integrity and unity of the EU, which is itself a core national interest.</p>  <p>  Now that we have further detail on the type of future relationship with the EU that the UK will seek and as we approach the start of the Article 50 negotiations, the Government&rsquo;s detailed preparatory work, which began over two years ago and has steadily intensified since then, will increasingly focus on the negotiations themselves, as well as on the analysis of the impacts of Brexit.</p></reply>

The United Nations has estimated that 100,000 South Sudanese people are already facing starvation, with a further one million on the brink of famine.  Following the resumption of the civil war in July 2016, the country is in a deep and profound crisis.  The UN estimates that 7.5 million South Sudanese people will require humanitarian assistance in 2017.  Humanitarian assistance is being delivered but it is being impeded by the difficult security situation and attacks on humanitarian workers.</p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners share the deep concern about the situation in South Sudan.  The Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on 12 December strongly condemning the outbreak of violence, and calling for measures to protect civilians in South Sudan.  The EU called on all parties to observe an immediate ceasefire and to end violations of human rights law.  It called on the Transitional Government to uphold its responsibility to protect civilians.  The Council Conclusions emphasised that the EU would continue to enforce the arms embargo on South Sudan, and urged the United Nations Security Council to impose a UN arms embargo.  The EU has also agreed to impose further autonomous restrictive measures against any individual who obstructs the peace process, prevents the exercise of humanitarian duties or incites, orders or commits atrocities against civilians.  The Conclusions called for the establishment of the Hybrid Court, so that anyone who commits criminal acts of violence in breach of South Sudanese or international law, would be held accountable before a court.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission has provided over &euro;381 million to respond to the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan since fighting broke out in December 2013.  Ireland is also playing its part bilaterally, having provided over &euro;46 million in humanitarian and development funding since December 2013 to respond to needs in South Sudan and among refugees in neighbouring countries.  I met with Southern Sudanese refugees who had just fled their homes during my visit to Northern Uganda last July.  </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation closely, with our EU partners and through our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, and our Embassies in Kampala and Nairobi.</p></reply>

Efforts have intensified in recent years to equip the mission network in particular to take advantage of new market opportunities for Irish business.  Trade promotion was a key part of the rationale for our expansion of the mission network three years ago to include Embassies in Bangkok, Jakarta, and Nairobi and new Consulates General in Hong Kong, Austin (Texas), and Sao Paulo. </p>  <p>  This expansion has recently been bolstered by the appointment of Commercial Attach&eacute;s in Brasilia, Mexico, Buenos Aires, Jakarta and Bucharest, and Economic Development Officers in Abuja and Nairobi.  These locally hired staff will focus on improving market access, identifying market opportunities, raising Ireland&rsquo;s visibility and facilitating Irish businesses overseas in locations where State agency presence is limited.  </p>  <p>  My Department has also recently implemented more flexible funding arrangements with a new system of Promotion and Outreach Budgets for the mission network.  This was rolled out in January.  The new system of Three Tiered Funding is designed to enhance the capacity of missions and regional groups to act more autonomously and catalytically in support of our High Level Goals, including of course Prosperity.   </p>  <p>  It is increasingly important that our work both at home and abroad is strategically focused and closely coordinated as a whole-of-government exercise.  My Department, together with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is currently finalising Ireland&rsquo;s new trade, tourism and investment strategy.  This strategy, which will be published next month, has been the subject of wide consultation with stakeholders and is designed to (i) provide strategic direction; (ii) set out an overarching framework, drawing together a range of economic and sectorial strategies; (iii) set out approaches to geographic markets; and (iv) act as a platform for enhanced global visibility.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for Partnership Government mandated whole-of-Government, cross-sectoral strategies for the Asia Pacific and Americas regions.  Work on the formulation of these strategies is well underway and will be complemented by our increased Embassy presence in these regions.</p>  <p>  All of these efforts will continue to be guided by the work of the Trade Division within my Department working closely with colleagues across Government, and by the Export Trade Council, which I chair.</p></reply>

The activities of Boko Haram continue to pose a threat to the people of Nigeria, and the wider Lake Chad region.  They involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls.  Over the past months the Nigerian Government, supported by the international community, has made some progress in the fight against Boko Haram.  The EU and UN have continued to provide assistance to the Nigerian Government to create a safe and secure environment for its people.  In August 2016, the EU pledged up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which supports 8,700 troops from Nigeria and neighbouring countries to promote regional security. </p>  <p>  Ireland is engaging with the Nigerian authorities, in conjunction with our EU and other international partners, in responding to the crisis.  Our Embassy in Abuja continues to monitor developments closely, and our Ambassador has made a number of visits to Borno State, most recently last week. </p>  <p>  The EU has also placed considerable emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood - Western Balkans, Turkey, and Middle East and North Africa &ndash; in responding to the threat posed by terrorism.  Actions include finalising counter-terrorism action plans with Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia, and Turkey and expanding the EU Counter Terrorism experts&rsquo; network to the Sahel and Western Balkans.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by the approach taken by the UN to countering terrorism and by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including those related to the financing of terrorism and the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU and UN levels level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, we have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.</p></reply>

Ireland is a strong supporter of the enlargement process, and views it as a transformative driver for peace and stability in the region.  The European Commission continues to work actively to support prospective member states in implementing reforms in order to make progress on their respective EU paths.  The Commission publishes regular reports on each of the candidate and potential candidate countries.  These provide a &lsquo;state of play&rsquo; assessment on the preparations for Union membership in each individual accession country across the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, highlight the remaining challenges and set out guidelines on key reform priorities.  </p><p>Progress on recommendations is reviewed at EU Council level, as well as at regular working groups in Brussels.

We provided &euro;25 million in 2016 alone, &euro;19 million of which was delivered through the Irish Aid programme, managed by my Department, and &euro;6 million through the Department of Agriculture, through the World Food Programme. </p>  <p>  Irish Aid funding seeks to meet the needs of the civilian population inside Syria and those who have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Jordan.  I will travel to both Lebanon and Jordan next week, where I will meet with Syrian refugee families and their host communities, as well as with the Irish NGOs and UN organisations working to meet their critical needs using humanitarian funding provided by the Irish Government. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s support to the civilian population inside Syria is also channelled through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners.  These partners provide humanitarian supplies and urgently needed health, education, water and sanitation services, as well as implementing measures to protect women, children and vulnerable families.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in particular, has proven capacity and expertise in reaching the most vulnerable communities in Syria and in gaining access to besieged areas.  During 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s funding supported the work of the ICRC to carry out 55 cross-frontline operations to bring food, clean water and essential aid to millions of Syrians.</p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria, which amounted to &euro;445 million in 2016.  The EU and its Member States are collectively the lead provider of international aid to the people of Syria and we intend to maintain this substantial commitment in 2017. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation in Syria and the region closely with a view to providing significant further assistance, focusing in particular on the needs of the civilian population.</p></reply>

The granting of planning permission in April 2016 for the hospital, satellite centres and related buildings was a huge and very welcome milestone for the project.  The first phase of construction (site clearing works) on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital began in August 2016 and will be substantially completed within a matter of weeks.</p>  <p>  An internationally recognised design team, supported by an experienced National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and Project Team, are in place to drive the new children&rsquo;s hospital project and to ensure that the project is delivered in accordance with national policy to optimal design and value for money.  They have followed best international design, planning and procurement process at each stage of the project.  </p>  <p>  The tender process for the main construction works for the new children&rsquo;s hospital and for the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals has recently concluded.  Local and international companies participated in the highly competitive tender process.  More than 35 people participated in review panels for the tenders.  The tenders were reviewed and measured against a number of technical and financial criteria and were independently peer-reviewed by construction experts with extensive experience of projects of this size and complexity. A preferred bidder - the most competitive - has been selected however the contract has not been awarded yet.</p>  <p>  While I am not in a position to comment on contract prices at this stage I understand that the final construction elements of the project compare favourably to the costs of international projects of a similar size and scale.  It is my intention to bring a Memorandum to Government shortly in relation to costs of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.</p>  <p>   The Department of Health continues to work closely with the HSE, the Children's Hospital Group Board and the Development Board to ensure that we deliver a world class hospital needed and wanted by children, young people, their families and the staff in the three children&rsquo;s hospitals.</p></reply>

In 2006, the McKinsey report, Children&rsquo;s Health First, recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and that it should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  The McKinsey report recognised the importance for quality of healthcare of having a critical mass of sub-specialist skills in a tertiary centre and stated this could be achieved, firstly, by serving a large enough population to support a full complement of sub-specialists and, secondly, by co-locating with an adult teaching hospital thus enabling access to specialties that encompass both adult and paediatric patients, facilitating clinical and academic &ldquo;cross fertilisation&rdquo;, and attracting the top staff. </p>  <p>Reviews since 2006 have reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult academic teaching hospital.  In 2011, Minister Reilly established an Independent Review Group to examine the project at the Mater.  The clinical aspect of this review was carried out by a team of four Chief Executive Officers drawn from the National Association of Children&rsquo;s Hospitals (NACHRI) and the Children&rsquo;s Hospitals International Executive Forum (CHIEF).  Their report stated that &ldquo;co-locating with tertiary adult and maternity hospitals is essential to the development of an excellent paediatric service.  This has become best practice internationally and was recognised in the McKinsey report.&rdquo;   </p>  <p>  In 2012, following the refusal of planning permission for the project at the Mater campus, Minister Reilly established the Dolphin Review Group to advise on next steps.  Their report stated that &ldquo;Having reviewed the reports already prepared and considered their analysis and opinions, and having also consulted with a wide range of professionals in the field, we are also of the view that co-location is essential and tri-location optimal.  We recommend that the Minister remains on this path.&rdquo;  Co-location with an adult hospital is the norm internationally, driven by four major advantages, namely access to adult specialists; access to expensive equipment (such as PET, MRI scanners); research and educational synergies; and facilitation of continuity in the care of the adolescent/young adult with chronic disease.  A clinicians' sub-group of the Dolphin Group examined issues relating to clinical specialties and sub-specialties, transitional care for adolescents, and the integration of paediatric health research and education in the new children's hospital.  From a clinical and academic perspective, the Dolphin Group identified St James's Hospital as the existing Dublin Academic Teaching Hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult partner in co-location because it has the broadest range of national specialties and excellent research and education infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  The Government decision to co-locate the hospital with St James's was announced on 6 November 2012.  In identifying the location, the Government considered the report of the Dolphin Group, and detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.  The decision was made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations paramount in the decision.</p></reply>

It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company.</p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  The matter is currently under consideration by the HSE Directorate, in accordance with the criteria set out in the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June of last year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.  The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: <i><i>www.ncpe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NCPE-website-summary_Final.pdf</i></i>.</p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement.  This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In keeping with the drug assessment process, the recommendation of the HSE Drugs Group regarding the reimbursement of Respreeza was considered by the HSE Leadership team.  The HSE has informed that the statutory assessment process is ongoing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-22a.484.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022200085#WRR02400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 to 199, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p>  <p>  In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information /dossier submitted by the Company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). </p>  <p>  In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.  Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p>  <p>  1. the health needs of the public;</p>  <p>  2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p>  <p>  3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p>  <p>  4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p>  <p>  5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p>  <p>  6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p>  <p>  7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p>  <p>  8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p>  <p>  9. the resources available to the HSE. </p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi and Kalydeco.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi or Kalydeco.</p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. </p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi and Kalydeco, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of both drugs.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  No decision has been reached regarding Orkambi and discussions are ongoing with regard to Kalydeco.  The matter is currently under consideration by the HSE Directorate. </p>  <p>  I understand how patients and their families must feel in these circumstances, as they await the decisions by the HSE in relation to reimbursement.  However, as with all new drugs developed, the HSE must follow a statutory process, as set out in the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

As such, they are recognised as valuable landscape features under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and thus are eligible for BPS payments.  It is also recognised that such features must be appropriately managed and maintained by appropriate trimming of hedgerows to keep them in optimum condition, both as field boundary features and to help maintain the optimum structure and thickness to encourage bird nesting etc., and best practice prevails where this is done as part of an appropriate cutting rotation.</p>  <p>  Their importance is further recognised through the inclusion of a number of hedgerow specific actions within the GLAS (Agri-environment Scheme under pillar II) where 7,627 farmers have committed to planting an additional 1,298 km of new hedges.  These new hedges must be planted by 31 March 2017.  In addition, farmers in GLAS can select the action of coppicing of hedges and/or laying of hedges which seek to improve the biodiversity value of escaped or abandoned hedges.</p>  <p>  Based on the research article Valuing the C sequestration potential for European agriculture from Aerstens, Nocker and Gobin (2013) it could be estimated that new hedges planted in GLAS could sequester 4858 tonnes of CO2 per year.</p>  <p>  The new LULUCF flexibility in the 2030 effort sharing regulation proposals offers opportunities to capture these credits in line with the LULUCF decision 2013 but in reality this is quite small against agri-emission approaching 20 mt.</p>  <p>  In contrast, unmaintained hedges grow tall and become gappy at the base, becoming less useful for wildlife and as a landscape feature.  Similarly, burning of growing vegetation can be an important land management tool in certain situations, where fire is used as a means to control scrub or to help improve cultivated land or as a means to develop and maintain fire breaks to protect forestry plantations and mitigating the risk of larger landscape scale fires, especially to put vital fire breaks in place to protect wider upland landscapes and forestry plantations.

Facilitators who meet their commitment under the programme are due a payment per participant of &euro;500 for each year of the three year programme while farmers are due &euro;750. Payment to facilitators under the programme covers the cost of preparing for and holding meetings as well as the time they spend producing an individualised Farm Improvement Plan for each farmer participant. My Department does not require a participant under the Knowledge Transfer Programme to be a client of Teagasc.  Participants were free to choose a group facilitated by either a private or Teagasc advisor.</p>  <p>  In addition to its involvement in the Knowledge Transfer Programme, Teagasc also provide an extensive range of Advisory Services to Ireland&rsquo;s farmers, including 45,000 direct contracts.  The primary purpose is to maximise the income and sustainability of farm families within rural communities through improved farm efficiency, based on the transfer of knowledge, new technologies and best practice to all sectors of the industry.  The cost of delivering these services is partially borne by the State in the form of an annual Grant-in-Aid, with the balance provided by fees charged to farmers, and some programme support from industry-mainly dairy processing co-ops.</p></reply>

A young farmer is defined as a farmer aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when they first submit an application under the Basic Payment Scheme and who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting that application.  A new entrant to farming is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years and did not have any agricultural activity in their own name and at their own risk in the five years preceding the start of the present agricultural activity.</p>  <p>  The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements to persons who suffer from a 'Specific Disadvantage'.

In that context, it runs commercial operations in a number of greyhound stadia, including Harold's Cross.</p>  <p>  In 2014, against the background of reducing income for the organisation through the recession, and a significant debt burden, my department commissioned an independent report into certain matters relating to Bord na gCon, including its financial performance and prospects.  That report provided a road map for the sustainable development of the greyhound sector, and in that context recommended a number of asset disposals, including Harold's Cross, in order to reduce that debt burden.</p>  <p>  I understand that Bord na gCon, in view of its substantial debt burden, having considered the matter and having regard to the recommendations in the Indecon Report, has decided to cease racing at Harold's Cross and initiate the sale of the stadium in order to reduce its debt levels and increase its capacity to provide support and assistance to the industry.</p>  <p>  While this is very regrettable, its view is that there is no other option if the burden of debt on the organisation is to be reduced in any meaningful way.  I understand that its intention is to transfer the Harold's Cross racing schedule to Shelbourne Park, a few kilometres away, and that all 12 staff at Harold's Cross will be offered redeployment.</p></reply>

In 2015, 6.5% of heat was derived from renewable sources in Ireland. </font><font color="#0D0D0D">During 2016, my Department undertook a detailed economic assessment on the design and cost of the RHI for the industrial/commercial sector.This assessment included a range of renewable energy technologies including biomass and focused on the approximately 3,000 large commercial and industrial heat users in the non-Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) in Ireland.  The focus on the larger heat users was underpinned by analysis completed in 2014 which indicated that it would not be cost effective, at this stage, to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI.  This is due to a number of factors including the much higher support tariff per kilowatt hour of energy that would be required to incentivise households to change heating systems, as well as the significantly greater costs associated with administering the scheme for a large number of households in what is an unregulated sector. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In order to support on-going investment in renewable heat installations, the Department will seek clearance from the European Commission that RHI support can apply to RHI applicants, who meet the criteria of the scheme, and were completed and first commissioned between the Government announcement on the RHI in 2014 and the start date of the RHI.A final decision on whether this will be facilitated is a matter for the European Commission to decide and will be formally announced at the time the scheme is cleared by the European Commission. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  I announced the final public consultation on the design and implementation of the new RHI scheme on 26 January, 2017 which is available on</font><i>www.dccae.gov.ie.</i><font color="#0D0D0D">I encourage all interested parties to submit a response to this consultation.  The information provided will help inform the final design of the new scheme.  The current consultation will close on 3 March, 2017.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Before any RHI scheme is introduced, the overall costs and technologies to be supported will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.  It is expected that a new scheme will become available at the end of 2017.</font></p></reply>

The Strategy includes an Action to 'Develop a standardised road safety cycling training proficiency programme for children and seek to make this programme available to as many schools as possible.'  The program encourages road awareness and being visible when cycling, and a pilot roll-out of the program in a number of schools across the country commenced in Autumn 2015.  Assimilated training has taken place to bring existing trainers up to the new standard and further training will be available for those wishing to attain the new standard.  A training register is administered by Cycling Ireland.  Rollout of 'CycleRight' to all interested schools began in recent weeks, funded by my Department and the RSA.  </p>  <p>  The RSA is continuing a number of road safety campaigns during 2017 through traditional media as well as through media aimed at younger people (digital and social media, cinema, in pubs, etc.) regarding speeding, seat-belt wearing, distracted driving/use of mobile phones, and alcohol and drug driving.  In addition RSA National Promotional Officers visit national and secondary schools to promote road safety awareness and the RSA work with other organisations, e.g., Motorsport Ireland at rally events and local authority Safety Officers to promote road safety to younger age groups.  The RSA run the 'Be Safe Be Seen' campaign, particularly through digital and social media used more by younger persons, throughout the year but with a particular focus when schools resume and in the winter months.</p>  <p>  I am also currently looking at other ways to ensure all road users, particularly cyclists and pedestrians, are highly visible at night, as that is sadly a cause for a high number of road deaths.</p></reply>

Common to all cases is the fact that, under EU law, Member States may issue driving licences only to people normally resident on their territory.  We cannot issue licences to people who have not taken up residence here.  </p>  <p>  The three cases are as follows.  First, if a person is a holder of a driving licence issued by another EU Member State, then on taking up residence here they can exchange if for the Irish equivalent.  Second, in the case of non-EU States we may reach bilateral agreements on exchange of driving licences.  If a person with a driving licence from a State with which we have a bilateral agreement takes up residence here, they too may exchange their licence for an Irish one.  Finally, if the person comes from a State with which we do not have an exchange arrangement, they are treated as a learner and must go through the driver learning process.  They are not, however, required to wait the normal 6 months before applying for a driving test.  </p>  <p>  The International Driving Permit (IDP), as it is properly called, is not a driving licence as such.  It is a translation of the person's national licence into an internationally recognised format.  As such, possession of an IDP has no relevance to the question of exchange of a licence.</p></reply>

The LEOs are the first port of call for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, in terms of advice, training, sign posting to other support providers and, in certain circumstances, grant support.  The LEOs undertake a number of activities to encourage businesses to build their online presence and compete in the online market place.</p>  <p>  The LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with training and advice, to micro companies (10 or less employees) who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity.  Since the start of the scheme in July 2014 to date almost 3,000 micro companies have availed of the TOVS. </p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace.  These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximising outputs from investment in online trading such as:</p>  <p>  - Marketing, focused mainly on development of an online/mobile marketing strategy;</p>  <p>  - Social Media, with the majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on how to use the different social media platforms to support their business;</p>  <p>  - eCommerce Sales Strategy, including how to convert website visits into sales; and</p>  <p>  - Search Engine Optimisation, including web analytics and video optimisation for web.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) works with 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, and building an online presence is part of the range of supports offered to those clients.  EI has supported projects focused on developing innovative products on new product platforms for international markets.  However, EI cannot support companies whose only function is in the area of sales/distribution.</p>  <p>  Working closely with the Irish Internet Association, EI delivers a range of funded and advisory eCommerce supports for its clients to develop their online marketing capabilities, for example:</p>  <p>  - &lsquo;Marketing Funding Support&rsquo;: under a Business Process Improvement Grant client companies can apply for grant support to plan and implement significant strategic e-marketing projects</p>  <p>  - &lsquo;Measuring your Internet Marketing Maturity&rsquo;: to help clients develop an understanding of their web presence and activity.</p>  <p>  EI regularly organises events which can connect clients with leading experts and inform them on best practice.  Topics covered include Developing an Online Strategy; Online Localisation for International Markets; Search Engine Optimisation; Pay Per Click Marketing; Branding and Getting the Web Content Right. </p>  <p>  EI also offers an Excel @ Export Selling Workshop Series which includes creating a digital marketing strategy.  This workshop is aimed at senior management executives with responsibility for selling high value products and services into business-to-business markets. </p>  <p>  Finally, one of the key challenges identified by members of the Retail Consultation Forum which I chair is developing digital capacity across the retail sector.  As set out in the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs, a pilot training programme to support retailers to scale up their online trading activity and expand into international markets will be developed.  This initiative is being driven by DJEI, working with members of the Retail Consultation Forum and skills providers.</p></reply>

However for the Bill to be legally sound, it must  ensure that the birth parents&rsquo; right to privacy is protected as required in Irish constitutional law.  This is one of the most important measures to protect this right, which includes, for example:</p>  <p>  - enabling a birth parent to register his or her name on the Register of Adoption Contact Enquiries and to express his or her contact preferences;</p>  <p>  - notifying a birth parent (whose name is entered on Register) in advance of the proposed release of birth certificate information and providing that parent with an opportunity to provide the Agency with a statement setting out his or her view that there are 'compelling reasons' as to why the information should not be released;</p>  <p>  - offering support and guidance to both parties.</p>  <p>  - Additionally, an awareness campaign will be undertaken during the first six months after commencement, to alert the relevant persons to the intention to release information to enable an adopted person to obtain his or her birth certificate (or a copy of his or her adoption order).</p></reply>

The Committee issued its report in November 2015 and included reference to the issue of refusal to disclose birth certificate information where Tusla, the Child and Family Agency considers that there are compelling reasons, such as may endanger the life of a person, for so doing. </p>  <p>  My Department considered the report of the Committee and a revised policy was developed to reflect concerns raised.  The Bill provides that where a birth mother has registered her details on the Register, Tusla will notify her, in writing, of the adopted person&rsquo;s application for his/her birth certificate information.  She will be offered support and guidance by the Agency and advised that the adopted person has also been also been offered support and guidance.  The birth mother will be advised that the information will be provided to the adopted person unless she advises Tusla within 12 weeks, that she considers that there are compelling reasons not to release this information.  Where the Agency having considered any information, either provided by a birth parent or otherwise available to it, considers that there are compelling reasons for not disclosing information, it will refer the matter to the Circuit Court for determination.  Any court hearing will be held in private.  Compelling reasons are reasons, that having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to endanger the life of a person.  This process only applies to the provision of birth certificate information to an adopted person, as such information which identifies the birth mother is being provided to an adopted person without the birth mothers consent.  Any information about an adopted person will be only provided to a birth parent, where the adopted person consents.</p></reply>

As a result of this process in January 2005 the Department of Health and Children published "Adoption Legislation: 2003 Consultation and Proposals For Change". The Report has served to inform the legislative developments that have taken place since then in particular the Adoption Act 2010 and the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016. </p>  <p>  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has operational responsibility for adoption in Ireland. In this regard I am advised by the Authority that it is proactive in its consultation with stakeholders.  The Authority continues to meet with various stakeholder groups on a regular basis. These include Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs, and the various Bodies accredited to provide adoption services and various country-specific adoption support groups (e.g. Viet South and the Irish Chinese Contact Group). </p>  <p>  I am also advised that during 2016, the CEO and/or members of the Authority's Senior Management Team met with the Adoption Rights Alliance, Irish Foster Care Association, Childrens' Rights Alliance and Treoir. The Authority also resumed meetings 'on circuit' which allowed it to meet locally based groups, e.g. 'Know My Own' (Cork), the Sligo Family Resource Centre and Danu.  The Authority intends to meet with local adoption groups in Galway and Waterford later this year.  Furthermore the Authority has held a variety of information seminars involving all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to establish the stakeholder adoption advisory groups but I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me advised of any issues which arise in their consultation.</p></reply>

However it did find that some services had come to rely on Community Employment scheme workers, and I determined that these services should be provided additional funding to enable them to recruit and retain qualified staff to work alongside their CE scheme participants. </p>  <p>  As a result, I have made available up to &euro;2,000 for services to assist with the recruitment process or to provide expert support in HR management, and I will make sufficient additional money available to each service after analysis of their individual financial situation to ensure that they can fully meet the cost of these staff until September 2017.  After this time these services should be in a position to fund these places through their own income; but this will be kept under review.  No service will be forced to close. </p>  <p>  Delivering high quality, accessible and affordable childcare is my key goal, and this funding will ensure that every child will be cared for by a qualified professional, and that services can sustain existing levels of provision, while they prepare for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme. Services are also providing more ECCE places than ever before, and I am confident that over 125,000 children will be receiving free pre-school care and education this summer. </p>  <p>  All Community Childcare services around the country were afforded an opportunity to engage with the Childcare Committees Ireland project during 2016; over 200 did so, and detailed analysis has been completed.  As some services clearly needed additional funding to maintain service levels,  this money has now been allocated from the provision made for Sustainability Funding in Budget 2017, and will be available for drawdown very shortly, with Pobal making payments on behalf of the local Childcare Committee.</p></reply>

When ECCE was expanded as a result of Budget 2016, it enabled all children to attend ECCE from the age of three, entering at one of three entry points after their third birthday, September, January or April, and remain there until they started in primary school, with the exception that they could not be more than 5 years and 6 months when they finished ECCE in June.  This followed a recommendation from the Expert Group " Right from the Start".</p>  <p>  The expansion of ECCE  increased the average time in ECCE from 38 weeks to 61 weeks with children benefitting from a range of 51 weeks to 88  weeks.  Whilst the terminology of  "a second year" is often used, it is important to recognise that most children do not benefit from a full second year.  All children currently finish in ECCE in June regardless of when they start (September, January or April). </p>  <p>  The Deputy has a number of questions relating to an increase from 22 weeks, in the &ldquo;second&rdquo; ECCE year (the first chronological year), to the weeks outlined hereunder.  There are three intakes for the additional weeks provided in Budget 2016 (September, January and April).  The questions have been answered using the assumption that the January and April intake of children would be extended so that each intake would be entitled instead to 32, 36 and 38 weeks for their first year in the respective questions; September intakes will always have 38 weeks.</p>  <p>  The cost to increase the January and April ECCE intakes to 32 weeks in their first year would potentially be &euro;38 million.</p>  <p>  The cost to increase the January and April ECCE intakes to 36 weeks in their first year would be &euro;48 million.</p>  <p>  The cost to increase the January and April ECCE intakes to 38 weeks in their first year would potentially be &euro;53 million.</p>  <p>  The cost to increase the first year of the ECCE scheme from 38 to 40 weeks would potentially be &euro;8 million.</p>  <p>  The cost to increase the first year of the ECCE scheme from 38 to 42 weeks would potentially be &euro;17 million.</p>  <p>  As a general principle and to provide a guideline, we can consider that each additional week for the April intake in their first year would cost &euro;1m, each additional week for the January intake in their first year would cost &euro;1.5m and each additional week for September intakes (including year 1 and year 2 children) would cost &euro;6million.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this question only addresses the financial aspect of such increases.  Any such changes would require revision of rules around eligibility and  enrolment dates and would need to look at issues of capacity with regard to physical space, staffing capacities and other associated matters.</p></reply>

This included additional funding to support service delivery to implement legislation.  Tusla is identifying gaps in the aftercare service nationally and has indicated that this will require an expansion in aftercare management and workers.  Tusla is currently finalising arrangements for the publication of its 2017 Business Plan which sets out the priorities for these important services in 2017.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that young people leaving care typically receive supports relating to accommodation, further education, employment and training, which are funded by other Government Departments.  This means that the part of Tusla&rsquo;s budget for 2017 which is ultimately allocated to aftercare services under the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 will represent just a small proportion of the total spending by the State on those in receipt of aftercare services.</p></reply>

I am pleased that the Act creates an explicit, as opposed to a current implicit, statement of Tusla&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the young persons need for assistance and support as they leave care.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with Tusla to ensure that the provisions of the Act can be fully implemented as quickly as possible in the coming months.  In preparation for the commencement of new legislation, Tusla has introduced a number of new practices.  It has developed dedicated aftercare teams, it has standardised the financial supports that it offers to those leaving care, and it continues to roll out inter-agency steering committees to strongly promote good co-ordination of these services at local level.  Fourteen committees are currently in operation with a final three committees in development. Tusla has also further developed the information it provides regarding aftercare services.</p>  <p>  Consultation is underway with all key stakeholders in order to finalise the revision of Tusla&rsquo;s Aftercare policy.  The consultation process has included foster carers, young people/young adults, aftercare staff, social work staff, NGO's, private foster care and residential care providers and other State departments.  All have been invited to events and offered the opportunity to make written submissions.  Ten events have taken place to date with two remaining.  Following these consultations feedback will be considered and amendments made to the draft document.  The final draft of the Aftercare documents will be presented to the National Policy Oversight Committee in Tusla for approval.  The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 will be commenced as soon as practicable after approval of the revised policy.</p>  <p>  Tusla has informed me that in 2016 a total of 605 young adults were discharged from care by reason of reaching 18 years of age, compared to 542 young adults in 2015.  This data was not collated prior to 2015.  In 2016, of the 467 young adults discharged prior to the end of September by reason of reaching 18 years of age, 457 were eligible for aftercare supports and 412 were availing of these.  2016 is the first year for which Tusla has collated data regarding uptake of aftercare supports. There were a total of 1,841 young people aged 18 to 22 years in receipt of aftercare supports from Tusla at the end of the third quarter in 2016, and 82% of these young people had an aftercare plan in place.  </p>  <p>  Once the amendments to the Child Care Act are commenced there will be a statutory obligation on Tusla to have an aftercare plan prior to the young person leaving care.  Those who have left care before the changes, and who do not have an aftercare plan, can under these amendments obtain an aftercare plan from Tusla up to their 21st birthday.  I believe that our young people leaving care deserve high quality supports throughout the system, and that full implementation of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 will be a key element of how our society helps them to make this critical transition in their lives.</p></reply>

In 2016, a total of 605 young persons left care by reason of reaching 18 years of age.  Tusla has informed me that the data was not collated prior to 2015.  The available data refers to all young persons moving out of care on turning 18 years of age and data is not returned by care category.  Each year, around 500 to 600 young persons will turn 18 years of age while in care.  In recent times, I understand that about 75% of 17 year olds in care were in foster placements, a further 20% approx. were reported to be placed in residential settings and the remaining 5% would be in other settings, for example a disability setting or supported lodgings. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that the transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people.  A key factor in achieving success is ensuring that assessment, preparation and planning for leaving care begins in the years prior to leaving care and continues as part of the care planning process.  This work is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate an aftercare plan that is specific to the individual young person's needs.  Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of the supports available to care leavers.</p></reply>

Every year approximately 450 young people leave the care of the State.  These young people are offered a wide range of services from different sectors including income supports, health supports, accommodation and education. </p>  <p>  A significant number of young people leaving care remain living with their foster carers.  Those who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.  The care leavers most vulnerable to homelessness are those leaving residential or short-term foster care placements.  Children who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.</p>  <p>  The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law in December 2015.  It entitles eligible young people to a formal aftercare plan, prepared by Tusla in collaboration with the young person leaving care.  In preparation for the commencement of this new legislation, Tusla has introduced a number of new practices.  It has developed dedicated aftercare teams, it has standardised the financial supports that it offers to those leaving care, and it continues to roll out inter-agency steering committees to strongly promote good co-ordination of these services at local level.</p>  <p>  In addition to the aftercare planning and supports provided by Tusla, Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness commits to ensuring that young people leaving State care and at risk of homelessness are identified and catered for through appropriate housing and other supports.  The provision of accommodation for young people leaving State care is now eligible for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme operated by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Under the Capital Assistance Scheme, Approved Voluntary Bodies provide accommodation to meet special housing needs such as those of the elderly, disabled or disadvantaged in their area.  Tusla and DCYA have commenced discussion on developing criteria for proposals under the Capital Assistance Scheme.  In relation to any accommodation provided under this scheme, Tusla will provide supports, particular for the most vulnerable Care Leavers, in accordance with the pre-agreed aftercare plan. </p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla has redistributed the protocol developed between Tusla and the Housing Authorities in 2014 on young people leaving state care.  The aim of this protocol is to ensure that the necessary measures are in place to prevent homelessness for young people leaving state care.  This will be applied and considered within aftercare steering groups.</p></reply>

On 30th September 2016 a census style count was carried out of children in care on that day.  This census showed that 603 children, representing 10% of children in care at the time, had been diagnosed by a clinical specialist as having a moderate to severe disability.</p>  <p>   These young people, in general, will seek to access a mainstream service, adult disability service or primary care service based on their level of need, facilitated by Tusla via the Local Aftercare Implementation Group.  The HSE participates in the planning process and is responsible for the provision of the required services.</p>  <p>  My Department has been liaising with a number of Government Departments to address issues regarding the provision of services to children in care and those transitioning out of care, and particularly with the Department of Health regarding the situation of children with disabilities transitioning from the care system.  In December, 2016, Tusla and the HSE agreed a new protocol in principle, which will operate to ensure good collaboration between Tusla and the HSE on disability related services for children.  This protocol provides a clear escalation process should an issue arise, or if there is an unresolved matter around access to appropriate, available services.  It is managed at a local level in the first instance.  Where this is not possible, there is a clear process in place to escalate the situation and agree a resolution to ensure the child in question is receiving an appropriate, timely, and proportionate service.  In addition, officials from both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health will agree, in the coming weeks, how best to further develop and copper fasten the appropriate oversight of this new working arrangement.</p></reply>

Therefore, the advertising strategy is a matter for the Commission to decide and I do not have any role or influence in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Commission of Investigation has conducted three advertising campaigns in Ireland using local and national radio and local and national newspapers.  These were conducted in June/July 2015, June 2016 and November 2016.  A number of radio stations also conducted interviews with a representative from the Commission. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Commission has written to a range of Irish groups in the UK and the USA inviting relevant people to come forward.  The Confidential Committee has already visited the UK for hearings and proposes to do so again in the near future. </p>  <p>  The Commission has stated that it is conducting a further advertising campaign this week to remind people that the closing date for the Confidential Committee is 1 March 2017.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Confidential Committee Report was initially due to be completed in August 2016 before the Government agreed to the Commission's  request for a time extension.  This additional time was provided to facilitate the large number of witnesses who wished to provide testimony in person to the Commission.  The Report must now be completed by February 2018 along with the Social History Report and the Final Report.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Commission has not set a deadline for applications to be heard by the Investigating Committee other than the general requirement to have the Final Report completed by February 2018.</p></reply>
