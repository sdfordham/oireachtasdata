Table 1 shows the number of persons on the Live Register over the period January 2010 to September 2014.It should be noted that the Live Register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, and seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance.  The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of estimates of employment and unemployment in the State.  The Q2 2014 estimates are the most recent QNHS figures available.

Total real value added increased from &euro;10.45 bn. in 2008 to &euro;16.75 bn. in 2013 an increase of over 60%.  The plateau in Total Pharmaceutical Sector value added in 2011 - 2012 and the decline in 2013 reflect the impact of the so called &quot;pharma cliff&quot; where a large number of patents for block buster drugs produced in Ireland expired.  Nevertheless the significance of the sector remains at 10.6% of total GVA for the economy in 2013 and the latest data for the first two quarters of 2014 indicate a return to growth.  As the vast majority of this sector is foreign owned the main impact of GVA produced is the employment effect, this is illustrated in the table on employment in this sector set out below.  Despite the impact of the patent cliff employment in the sector continued to grow in 2013 to 35,390 from 32,644 in 2012.<br/><br/>Table 1: Pharmaceutical Sector Gross Value Added (GVA) in &euro;millions at Constant Basic Prices (chain linked annually and referenced to year 2012) <table><tr><th>NACE <br /><br />REV.2<br /><br />section</th><th>NACE <br /><br />REV.2<br /><br />division</th><th>Description</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>CD-CF</td><td>19 - 21</td><td>Total pharmaceutical Sector GVA</td><td>10,450</td><td>12,842</td><td>16,158</td><td>17,488</td><td>17,599</td><td>16,749</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Pharmaceutical sector contribution to Total Economy GVA.</td><td>6.6%</td><td>8.5%</td><td>10.7%</td><td>11.2%</td><td>11.2%</td><td>10.6%</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Table 2: Pharmaceutical Sector Employment - Full Time Equivalents (FTE) (all in employment) - annual average over four calendar quarters<table><tr><th>NACE <br /><br />REV.2<br /><br />section</th><th>NACE <br /><br />REV.2<br /><br />division</th><th>Description</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>CD-CF</td><td>19 - 21</td><td>Total pharmaceutical Sector Employment (FTE)</td><td>31,982</td><td>30,541</td><td>34,659</td><td>33,441</td><td>32,644</td><td>35,390</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Pharmaceutical sector contribution to Total Employment.</td><td>1.6%</td><td>1.7%</td><td>2.1%</td><td>2.0%</td><td>2.0%</td><td>2.1%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review of maximum rent limits in mid-2013 saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%. </p><p>  The Department is currently reviewing maximum rent limits.  However, the current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand.  I would be concerned that raising rent limits is not the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students.  The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant.  A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014. </p><p>  In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, almost 140 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.</p><p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  HAP is being introduced to provide a more integrated system of housing supports and has been designed to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.</p><p>   HAP was introduced in Cork County Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council on 15th September, 2014 and in South Dublin County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Monaghan County Council and Louth County Council on 1st October, 2014.  Department of Social Protection officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to support the implementation of HAP within the selected local authorities. </p><p>  In areas where HAP is in operation, rent supplement will continue to be paid to new clients who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short term income support in order to pay their rent.  Arrangements are also being made with the relevant local authorities to transfer existing customers, in receipt of rent supplement for periods of 18 months or more, to HAP.  These measures will return rent supplement to fulfilling its original intention of being a short term support.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;31.3 million for the ENP scheme in 2014. </p><p>  A review of the guidelines on exceptional needs payments was carried out during 2012 by a working group of staff from the Department's community welfare service.  One of the recommendations emanating from this review was to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, to the payment of ENPs.  This review has been used as a basis for revised guidelines that issued to staff in 2012 and 2013, recommending maximum amounts payable under the scheme for a variety of household and personal items, to ensure consistency with regard to payment levels on a national basis including assistance in setting up home in local authority allocated housing.  A copy of these guidelines has been provided to the Deputy. </p><p>  Traditionally local authorities have provided social housing to tenants on an unfurnished basis and it was the responsibility of the tenant to furnish the property.  These units were by and large units either built or purchased by local authorities.  Where a tenant cannot furnish such a property from within his/her own resources he/she can apply for an exceptional needs payment to assist them in furnishing the property.  </p><p>  The provision of local authority housing has been refocused toward providing accommodation by way of leasing.  It is not considered appropriate that ENPs would be provided for furnishing local authority leased accommodation. </p><p>  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment or pre-determined amounts under the scheme.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p><p>  The guidelines assist Departmental staff and do not limit the discretionary powers available to officers administering the scheme to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.  Officials in the Department continue to review the issue of payments under the ENP scheme to ensure consistency and fairness.</p></reply>

Expenditure on the FIS scheme is estimated to be &euro;281.7 million in 2014, an increase of &euro;20 million over 2013 figures.  <br/><br/>A Department of Social Protection estimate, based on the Quarterly National Household Survey conducted by the Central Statistics Office, gave the number of households with children present and at least one adult working as <b>585,000</b>for quarter 2, 2014. <br/><br/>At end the end of quarter 2 there were <b>46,267</b>people in receipt of FIS.  This gives the percentage of working households in receipt of FIS as almost <b>8%.</b><br/><br/>At the end of September 2014 there were <b>48,493</b>people in receipt of FIS of which <b>3,816 </b>were public servants.  The number of children for which FIS is being claimed for is <b>107,695</b>at the end of September 2014.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the number of civil servants who are receiving FIS is included in the figure for public servants.  A separate breakdown for civil servants is not currently available, due to the way that data is captured on the department's computer data base for FIS applicants.</p></reply>

The preserved benefit is a proportion of the long service benefit to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had remained in employment until normal pensionable age.</p><p>  If a members long service benefit is provided for under the rules of the scheme on a defined contribution basis, then the value of the preserved benefit at the date on which it becomes payable is equal to the accumulated value of the appropriate contributions.</p><p>  The preserved benefit which is payable from a defined benefit pension scheme will normally be revalued annually by the lower of 4% or the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index.</p><p>  Section 50 of the Pensions Act provides for the restructuring of the benefits in a defined benefit pension scheme in situations where the scheme does not satisfy the scheme funding requirement as set out in the Pension Act.  In the event that the trustees of a scheme are considering a restructure of scheme benefits under this provision, they can consider adjusting the benefits of both active and deferred scheme members.  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 extended the provisions in section 50 to include a portion of benefits payable to pensioners.  Under this change, the pensioner benefits are protected up to &euro;12,000 per annum, benefits over &euro;12,000 and less than &euro;60,000 can be reduced by up to 10% while benefits over &euro;60,000 can be reduced by up to 20%.</p><p>  These provisions in section 50 of the Act essentially provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members.  The issue of how these changes might be applied is a matter for the trustees of a scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries. </p><p>  There are no plans at this stage to bring forward amending legislation to enhance the present provisions in the Act in relation to deferred scheme members.</p></reply>

The decision to re-employ the Chief Medical Advisor was taken due to his specific skills and his involvement in the policy reform of the illness related schemes, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing his skills, and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department.

These costs must be taken into account in evaluations. In particular, for tax expenditure evaluations two types of opportunity costs should be considered:<br/><br/>- The opportunity cost of labour; and,<br/><br/>- The opportunity (or marginal) cost of public funds.<br/><br/>In relation to the specific proposal, I would point out that there are a number of other reliefs available for sports, including the capital projects you mention in your question and retirement relief for certain sportspersons which was introduced in Finance Act 2002. The categories of sportspersons that can avail of tax relief are listed in Schedule 23A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, (TCA). These categories originally included athletes, badminton players, boxers, cyclists, footballers, golfers, jockeys, motor racing drivers, rugby players, squash players, swimmers and tennis players.<br/><br/>There is scope for me, as Minister for Finance, to add to this list by regulation after consultation with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport if a justifiable case is made on behalf of categories of sportspersons with direct earnings that are excluded.<br/><br/>I have no plans to introduce tax relief for donations to sports development projects at this time.</p></reply>

If the true relationship between parties is that of an employer/employee then the employer is required, under the Tax Code, to operate PAYE on payments made to the employee. If, however, the true relationship is not that of an employer/employee then, where the relationship relates to construction operations, as defined within the Tax Code, there is a requirement to operate the relevant RCT provisions. These provisions were placed on an electronic platform with effect from 1 January 2012.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the eRCT system is working efficiently and that it has removed substantially the vulnerabilities for fraud, mainly from bogus documentation, that attached to the previous paper based relevant contracts tax system.

A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relation ship between the Minister for Finance and each bank. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at: .<br/><br/>Notwithstanding this, officials in my Department have referred the issue to Bank of Ireland and have received the following comment in this regard:<br/><br/>&quot;The US Government has a restrictive trade embargo against Cuba. The US legislative and regulatory measures include an embargo on making or receiving payments from Cuba and/or facilitating the making or receiving of payments from Cuba.<br/><br/>Bank of Ireland depends on correspondent banks for the processing of our national, European and international transactions, including our SEPA (Single European Payment Area) transactions. We are reliant on our correspondent banks because they process and facilitate all such transactions on our behalf. The current issue has arisen as a result of the transition to SEPA. As it happens, our principal correspondent bank for SEPA transactions is a leading US bank who must comply with its own regulatory requirements and obligations to avoid a possible exposure to regulatory sanctions and penalties.<br/><br/>As a result, we are not in a position to process such transactions. This affects all international payments to or from Cuba and also any related SEPA payments.&quot;<br/><br/>I have also been asked previously if I, as Minister for Finance, would challenge relevant U.S. policy. My response, which has not changed, is to highlight that US policy in this regard is not restricted to Ireland and extends worldwide and accordingly I do not intend to challenge this policy as I would not expect a positive outcome to such an action.</p></reply>

The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has been the cornerstone of our corporation tax policy since the 1950s so I believe that any change that may result from the BEPS process will lead to additional opportunities for Ireland.  Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass-plate location.  We only have and want real substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment into Ireland.  That policy will continue to bring success in the post-BEPS environment.</p><p>  At 12.5%, Ireland has the most competitive headline corporate tax rate in the OECD, which is applied to a broad base.  Corporate tax rates are a matter of national sovereignty. This Government is committed to maintaining it.</p><p>  Ireland's offering of a competitive corporate tax rate, the availability of skills, and a reputation for being business friendly is a huge advantage that other countries will struggle to match.  As international tax loopholes progressively get closed down, our low general corporation tax rate will become even more attractive.</p><p>  Indeed as we continue to improve our offering for knowledge based investment, R&amp;amp;D and intellectual property, I believe over the coming years we can continue to grow our share of FDI-related investment.</p></reply>

Exchequer receipts for LPT also include payments of Household Charge.<br/><br/>The introduction of Local Property Tax, amounting, as it did, to the largest extension of the self-assessment system in the history of the State, represented a very significant administrative challenge for Revenue and it has handled this challenge extremely well.  LPT has now achieved a compliance rate of 95% in respect of 2013 and 94% in respect of 2014. The Commissioners have also successfully implemented the collection of Household Charge arrears which, to date, has yielded about &euro;33m in respect of 181,000 properties.  I am also advised that Revenue's work on ensuring that the highest possible levels of LPT compliance for 2013 and 2014 and for the Household Charge is ongoing.<br/><br/>I want to again commend Revenue for the excellent work it has done in taking LPT from concept to a fully functioning tax in such a short period of time.  The work involved included the enacting of legislation, the building of a completely new residential property Register, the development of a secure online system for filing and paying LPT via the Revenue website, the provision of customer service to such a large volume of taxpayers and critically the lodgement of in excess of &euro;700m to date to the Exchequer.<br/><br/>The Deputy may also be aware that the Commissioners launched their pay and file campaign for 2015 last Friday 10 October, which will be supported by a public communications campaign. Letters will issue between 20 October and 31 October to around 1 million property owners who paid their 2014 LPT charge in full, in a single payment or who made regular cash payments, requesting them to make arrangements for paying their 2015 LPT charge. As with 2014, no letters will issue to property owners who paid their 2014 LPT charge by direct debit or by deduction at source from their salary, occupational pension or from payments received from certain Government Departments, as these payment methods will automatically carry over into 2015.<br/><br/>The Commissioners will also be implementing a range of reductions in the rate of LPT (known as the local adjustment factor) that were agreed by fourteen different local authorities during September.  This work will ensure that property owners pay the correct amount of LPT for 2015.<br/><br/>Further details about LPT liabilities, payment options and dates for 2015 are available on the Revenue website at: and I am advised that briefing material was provided by Revenue directly to all members of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The main deductible expenses are:<br/><br/>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;<br/><br/>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;<br/><br/>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;<br/><br/>- the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and<br/><br/>- payment of local authority rates.<br/><br/>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.<br/><br/>Where the aggregate of deductible expenses in any year exceed the gross rental income, the amount of the deficit is set against rental profits of the same year from other property. Where there are no other rental profits in the same year, the deficit is carried forward as a rental loss for offset against rental profits in future years.<br/><br/>The 75% restriction on interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair residential property was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances and I have no plans at this stage to amend it.</p></reply>

Revenue had made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the last three years, and reports now indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly known as petrol stretching. This involves the illegal addition of a low cost commodity to petrol to defraud the exchequer and the motorist.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and that they have been in contact with the motor and oil trades. I understand also that they have taken samples from a number of filling stations that it has been claimed may have been sources of adulterated fuel, and that they will undertake any further enquiries and sampling that are required as a result of reports or information that they receive. These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that petrol stretching has occurred, and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution. The analysis of petrol samples is time-consuming and results in respect of the samples recently taken are awaited.</p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that, with this cooperation, and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, any problems of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. It is essential that petrol distributors report any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific traders are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel.</p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol and report to Revenue any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines.  Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions where possible. In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices including petrol stretching.</p></reply>

Section 1095 (3) provides that Revenue will issue a tax clearance certificate where a person or business is in compliance with all obligations to pay taxes, interest and penalties that are due to the State under the Acts and to file any tax returns that are required to be made.</p><p>  The purpose of the tax clearance scheme is to ensure that businesses (residents and non-residents) that derive an economic benefit from the State are in compliance with their tax obligations to the State. Such tax clearance certification is required for Public Sector Contracts, Grant Payments and certain Licence Applications (Section 1094 of the Act).</p><p>  While the awarding of a State contract is a matter for the relevant State authority, a condition is that the tenderer must have a current tax clearance certificate in respect of Irish tax. Where Revenue issues such a tax clearance certificate it is in respect of Irish tax rather than the tax status of the applicant in its country of residence. However, as part of the validation process for non-resident applicants (including those from Northern Ireland), routine checks are carried out to authenticate the identity of the business/person.</p><p>  In regard to eRCT, Revenue has advised me that the system operates on a 'deduction at source' basis and applies to payments made under contracts in the construction, meat processing and forestry sectors (including Public Sector construction contracts). The system was introduced in 2012 (replacing the previous paper based system) to bring more control and oversight to construction sector contracts. As part of the process, businesses in receipt of payments made under a contract are, depending on their tax compliance record, assigned a tax deduction rate of 0%, 20% or 35%. For non-resident contractors to qualify for the 0% rate the business must have complied with all of the comparable obligations imposed by the laws of the tax jurisdiction in which the business is tax resident as apply to Irish resident contractors. Where proof of compliance is not received then the business may be assigned to the higher 20% or 35% automatic deduction rates (normally 35% in such circumstances).</p><p>  I am satisfied that between the administration of tax clearance certification and the operation of eRCT, Revenue has good systems in place to mitigate the potential for tax non-compliance among non-resident businesses operating in the State. However, if the Deputy or the person in question has any knowledge in regard to non-compliance by individual non-resident contractors then that information should be immediately made available to Revenue. </p></reply>

The surcharge for the year 2008 is 10% of the gross tax of &euro;27,509.06 and amounts to &euro;2,750.90.<br/><br/>For the year 2010, the surcharge is computed on the gross tax and additional levies.  The surcharge applicable to tax is 10% of the gross tax of &euro;10,426.80 and amounts to &euro;1,042.68. The surcharge in relation to the additional levies is computed on a net basis after deduction of levies paid through the payroll. This surcharge is 10% of the net levies of &euro;412.30 and amounts to &euro; 41.23.

However neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. Moreover ultimately the pricing of financial products, including  mortgage interest rates, is a commercial matter for the management and the Boards of the banks. The Relationship Frameworks will remain in place as it would be inappropriate for the State, or politicians for that matter, to  intervene directly in the day to day running of these institutions while we retain significant positions of ownership.</p><p>  I should also point out that while the cost of funds for the Irish banks has come down significantly in the past couple of years, which has been a key objective for my Department, it is still much higher than the ECB base rate. At  a system  level, the amount of ECB funding has  also reduced significantly and is a fraction of where it was at the peak of the crisis so the ECB base rate is not the best approximation of the average rate that banks pay for their funding. Finally the banks must ensure that the rate they lend at is economically sustainable and provides a return for the bank and ultimately the State as a shareholder. Without a positive return on their lending, banks would not be capable of maintaining and growing their capital base and thus be in a position to support the economy.</p></reply>

Normally, a couple whose only income source is a Department of Social Protection (DSP) payment would qualify for such a deferral providing they are occupying the property in question. The Act is very specific in this regard and Revenue has no discretion in the application of the law as set down.<br/><br/>The Deputy will also be aware from my reply to Question 37827/14 that I included a provision in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 that allows a deferral of the Local Property Tax (LPT) charge that is not restricted to owner-occupiers. This deferral option applies where a property owner suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense as a result of which they are unable to pay their LPT, or maintain phased payment arrangements, without causing excessive financial hardship. Claims for this type of deferral require full disclosure to Revenue of the particular loss or expense that resulted in the financial hardship. The submission, which should be completed on the Form 'LPT 2' must also include details of the person's overall financial circumstances. Full information on the conditions and the application process in respect of deferral of LPT on hardship grounds is available on the Revenue website at .<br/><br/>In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy now refers, the persons concerned do not meet the qualifying criteria for the income based deferral as they do not reside in the property in question. However from the information provided by the Deputy they may qualify for a deferral on hardship grounds. Revenue has advised me that the persons in question recently wrote to LPT Branch in regard to possible deferral of their liabilities. LPT Branch replied confirming non-entitlement to deferral based on income but indicating the possibility of deferral based on hardship. LPT Branch also set out the application process including the requirement to file the 2013 LPT Return.<br/><br/>Revenue has confirmed to me that the persons in question have not yet responded to the reply that issued to them in respect of their letter. I would urge the Deputy to advise the persons to engage with LPT Branch as soon as possible, using the direct contact name provided to them, to bring matters to a conclusion and avoid any unnecessary enforcement action that might occur on foot of continued non-engagement.</p></reply>

A requirement to pay management fees is not relevant in determining liability to the LPT.</p><p>  Generally, properties in managed estates, to which such fees apply, would have been purchased by their owners in the knowledge that they would be taking on commitments to partake in and to fund the management of the estate, and that it was the intention that many such estates would not be taken in charge by local authorities, nor would it be appropriate for local authorities to do so.   Management fees in these estates generally relate to the maintenance, upkeep and insurance of private property and may, in some instances, include services such as refuse collection and a sinking fund for certain repairs to the buildings which most residential property owners, who don t pay management fees, also have to meet. The provision of a relief for those who pay management fees without regard to the vast bulk of homeowners who have to meet the cost of similar necessities in respect of their own properties would be inequitable.</p><p>  Revenue from the LPT accrues to local authorities, and supports the provision of local services.  Local authorities provide a broad range of services in the public realm which benefit the wider community, the proper functioning of which are important for the wellbeing of every community and household.  These include fire and emergency services; road maintenance and cleaning; street lighting; spatial and development planning and other similar services; regulatory and inspection functions and business support services, as well as libraries, parks, and other recreation and cultural public amenities.</p><p>  I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for homeowners who are liable for both the local property tax and private management fees.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-14a.182.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014101400054#WRE00400"><p>In response to the Deputy's question I can confirm that in 2012 and 2013, no public or civil servant in my Department in receipt of a pension had been recruited on a temporary or permanent basis.  To date in 2014, two retired public servants were awarded temporary contracts through open competition with the Public Appointment Services.</p><p>  The Audit Committee for the Office of the Ombudsman must include external members.  It is also highly desirable that members have experience of corporate governance and have some knowledge of the Public Service.  The Chairperson of the Ombudsman's Audit Committee and one external member of the Audit Committee are former Public Servants.  The Audit Committee meets four times per annum.</p><p>  In the course of running recruitment competitions to fill vacancies arising between 2012 and 2014, the Office of the Ombudsman engaged 4 trained and experienced former public servants to chair the interview panels for a total of seven days.  The chairpersons of these selection boards had not worked in the Office and as such were well placed to ensure that the selection processes were conducted in an impartial and objective manner. </p><p>  Following the retirement of 8 senior and experienced staff in summer 2014 and pending the completion of appointment processes for their successors, the Office was challenged to avoid backlogs developing, to keep up to date with routine work and to continue with some complex investigations.  The office engaged one retired member of staff to support the Office with one high profile investigation.  It is anticipated that this person will have worked for between 20 and 25 days between August and the completion of this investigation in December 2014. </p><p>  Finally, the Office of the Ombudsman has engaged one retired public servant to support the work of the Commission for Public Service Appointments in examining two separate complaints.  Again this person was engaged on foot of the retirement of experienced staff from the broader Office and pending appointment of their successors. </p><p>  For this work, retired members are paid on a fee-per-day basis and are subject to tax and other relevant deductions.  The fees are linked to pre-retirement grades and take account of the principal of pension abatement.</p><p>  While the Public Appointments Service (PAS) does not generally &quot;recruit&quot; former civil/public servants, in the course of running recruitment competitions for the public service it avails, inter alia, of trained and experienced retired public servants as interviewers, assessors and as decisions arbitrators.  These engagements would typically be of short duration (a matter of days) and no individual has any expectation of continuing engagement.  For this work, retired members are paid on a fee-per-day basis and are subject to tax and other relevant deductions.  The fees are linked to pre-retirement grades and take account of the principle of pension abatement.  The total number of former public servants employed in 2012, 2013 and 2014 are 91, 76 and 73 respectively.</p><p>  PAS would also source interviewers and assessors from among serving public servants (who would be paid no fee) as well as retired and working individuals from the private sector.  The former Chairman of the Public Appointments Service Board is also a former Civil Servant; he served on the PAS Board in 2012, 2013 and up to 31st August 2014.  The Chairperson of the PAS Internal Audit Committee is also a former Public Servant; she served in this role in 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014.</p><p>  The Valuation Office engaged the services of one former member of staff in 2012 as an external member of an Audit Committee.  In addition to this another former staff member was employed as a consultant on valuation matters in 2013.  Both staff members are still currently employed.</p><p>  In the period 2012 to date, the number of staff recruited by the Office of Public Works who were already in receipt of a public or civil service pension is 10, nine of whom are seasonal guides, recruited following a public recruitment process which was advertised nationally.</p></reply>

A number of initiatives have taken place to improve the provision of public services to citizens depending on the particular service. <br/><br/>My own Department provides the website , which gives access in one location online to more than 400 informational and transactional public services. <br/><br/>The Citizens Information Board (CIB) provides the website, , which has comprehensive information on public services and on the entitlements of citizens in Ireland.  CIB provides a range of services through its cross-country network of Citizens Information Centres and it supports the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).<br/><br/>In addition, a number of initiatives provide focused information and services tailored for particular sectors. These include for example<br/><br/>-the Department of Social Protection's network of Intreo Centres, which, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, provide practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers and employers alike; and<br/><br/>-online services such as , which provides, in one place, details of the main regulations which affect businesses.<br/><br/>Improvements in the provision of public services is kept under continuing review as part of our ongoing commitment to the Government's reform agenda.</p></reply>

Since 2009, my Department has paid in excess of &euro;6.2 billion to some 125,000 farmers under the SFP.  Essentially, all of the EU funding available was drawn and paid to farmers during that period.  In 2009, following the CAP Health Check agreement, provisions were adopted for the use of unused SFP funds. This was based on a proposal from Ireland and a number of other Member States.  Since that time, over &euro;107 million was paid to Irish farmers from unused SFP funds under the Upland Sheep Scheme, Grassland Sheep Scheme, Dairy Efficiency Programme, Beef Data Programme and the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme.  Under Pillar Two of the Common Agricultural Policy, Member States develop multi-annual Rural Development Programmes (RDP), which are co-financed by EU and national exchequer funding.  Ireland's overall European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) allocation from the EU for the 2007-2013 period is some &euro;2.5 billion.  The 2007-2013 RDP is nearing the end of its cycle, as under the N+2 rule expenditure may continue until the end of 2015. Expenditure will continue up to until the end of 2015 with the aim of maximising the drawdown of available EU funds.  To date Ireland has one of the highest rates of drawdown amongst the EU Member States. </p><p>  In addition, Ireland submitted its draft Rural Development Programme for the 2014-2020 period earlier this year.  There is &euro;2.19bn EAFRD funding available for the new programming period. </p></reply>

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 (which replaced Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004) provides that where there is an over-declaration, applicants are not entitled to benefit from payment until the over-claim is resolved.  This provision has been implemented in Ireland since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme, in 2005.  In practice where any land parcel is claimed beyond its confirmed size in hectares an &lsquo;over-claim&rsquo; is flagged and payment is withheld pending resolution of that over-claim.  In the case of Glenahiry commonage, more land than is contained in the entire commonage has been claimed by applicants, since 2005.  All applicants have confirmed their rights to claim certain shares of the Glenahiry commonage.  Consequently, this is a legal dispute over rights to the commonage.</p><p>  Furthermore, my Department has no jurisdiction in relation to disputes over Title, Ownership or grazing claims to land.  All parties to this dispute have been made aware of this.  The law on incorporeal hereditaments is very complex.  The establishment and loss of same is governed by the prescription acts and common law.  In this case Legal Title is based on a Land Commission Vesting Order dated 30th June 1950.  Some parties may have established grazing rights on the mountain and other parties may have lost same.  This is obviously a matter of evidence and the Circuit or High Court has jurisdiction in the matter.  The area is further complicated in that grazing rights invariably attach to appurtenant lowland and from our experience the court orders obtained by claimants are based on the common law principles of &lsquo;Levancy and Couchancy&rsquo;.  In simple terms this means that the right to graze is based upon the ability of a person&rsquo;s lowland to sustain the sheep for the winter period.</p><p>  I would also like to bring to the attention of the Deputy the efforts made by my Department to find a resolution to this dispute.  In particular, I wish to refer to the number of meetings organised by my Department at which efforts were made to resolve the dispute and allow payments to issue.  In addition, officers of my Department have spent much time over many years in discussions with the parties involved.  However, no resolution could be achieved despite the efforts made by my Department to secure a settlement.  I acknowledge that this is a complex legal dispute that has proved impossible to resolve since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme and has clearly evoked strong feelings amongst those involved.</p><p>  I would strongly urge all of the parties directly involved with this commonage and their representatives to come together and seek a resolution to this matter.  Their cooperation and agreement is the only way in which this matter can be resolved.  My Department continues to be available to facilitate the reaching of such an agreement.  It will, in the context of the end of the Single Payment Scheme this year and its replacement by the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, re-examine all the issues involved.</p></reply>

The original requirement was for 80% participation at commonage level, but this was subsequently reduced to 50%, with a further stipulation that this need only be calculated on the basis of the number of active shareholders on the commonage, i.e. those actually grazing the land.  To give an example, if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage, and 15 are claiming shares under the Single Payment Scheme, but only 10 of those are actively grazing the land at present, the 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS is just <b>5 farmers</b>.  Both steps have significantly reduced the challenge of securing the required level of agreement. <br/><br/>That said, 50% participation remains the target and in fact I hope and believe that a significantly higher percentage will ultimately join the new scheme.  However, it is important to note that farmers are free to signal their interest individually to their own adviser, or to the co-ordinating adviser for the commonage, without a requirement to first come together as a group.  Once sufficient numbers have indicated their interest, the plan for the commonage can be drawn up using the online systems and databases that are currently being built by my Department.  That plan must be submitted by a single adviser for the whole commonage, and there can only be one plan for each commonage. <br/><br/>Where it proves impossible to reach the required 50%, I have already indicated that the farmers concerned &ndash; or indeed an individual farmer, should the situation arise &ndash; may bring the case before the Commonage Implementation Committee for consideration and recommendation.  I have already made it clear that no farmer will be locked-out of GLAS if, through no fault of his or her own, it has proved impossible to reach the required 50% on the commonage concerned.  In addition, I have also clarified that on small commonages, i.e. those of 10 hectares or less, the 50% rule does not apply at all, and in those instances farmers are free to join GLAS on an individual basis, in the same way as they would on their privately owned land.<br/><br/>Over the last few weeks, I arranged for a series of public meetings to be held at key locations nationwide to give hill farmers an opportunity to talk to officials from my Department for themselves and raise the issues that continue to give them concern.  I am glad to say these meetings were well attended and I believe we have brought a good deal of clarity to the situation and the level of interest, in what is essentially a voluntary scheme, is very encouraging.</p></reply>

Under the Programme, it is proposed to introduce an on farm capital investment scheme, the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme II. This new scheme will involve a standard grant rate of 40 per cent in general and a specific grant rate of 60 per cent for the young farmer capital investment scheme. The approval of the EU Commission will be required before any new measures can be introduced under the new Rural Development Programme.</p><p>  As regards credit availability for farmers, I have regular meetings with the CEOs of the three main banks, and all have emphasised that the banks are willing and anxious to lend to farmers seeking to expand.  If a farmer has had an application for credit refused or reduced and feels that the bank's decision is unjustified, s/he can seek to have the issue reviewed by the Credit Review Office.</p><p>  A number of initiatives have been taken by the Government to improve access to non-bank sources of finance. My Department is actively engaged in the State Bodies Group on Access to Finance, chaired by the Department of Finance, which monitors progress on these initiatives.</p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <br/><br/>In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<br/><br/>The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<br/><br/> The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows: <blockquote>-Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. <br /><br />-Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<br /><br />-Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</blockquote>With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  I can assure the Deputy that in examining this claim from PDFORRA, all pertinent facts including cost to the Exchequer and benefit to the Defence Forces have been considered. <br/><br/>As discussions under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any matter in respect of this claim.  However, I can advise that, while there was significant progress made in these discussions, it was not possible to reach full agreement and, as a result, the issue is being referred to third party adjudication.</p></reply>

The membership of the interim Board appointed in 2011 is set out in the table.<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Nominating Bodies</th></tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Chairperson</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Brian Spain Director, Department of Defence</td><td>Nominated by Minister for Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Members</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Cathal Duffy Principal Officer, Department of Defence</td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Clare Tiernan Principal Officer, Department of Defence</td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Robert Mooney Principal Officer, Department of Defence</td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Bill Smith Director General, Civil Defence Board</td><td>Appointed as Director General, Civil Defence Board</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Ned Gleeson County Manager, Limerick County Council</td><td>Nominated by City &amp;amp; County Managers Association</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Keith Leonard Assistant Fire Advisor, Department Environment, Community and Local Government</td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Barbara Rafferty</td><td>Nominated by Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Becci Cantrell</td><td>Nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Veronica Forde Assistant Civil Defence Officer</td><td>Nominated by the Civil Defence Officers Association</td></tr><tr><td>Lt.

In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. <br/><br/>The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013. <br/><br/>The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. <br/><br/>There have been two appointments to the Army Pensions Board since the General Election of 2011. A serving military officer was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011, and a civilian doctor was appointed as non military ordinary member in November 2013. <br/><br/>The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011. The then Minister for Defence appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff. As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 13 January 2012.<br/><br/>The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.  A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and Dr. Loretta Nolan was appointed to the Board on foot of this public advertisement process.  Details of Dr. Nolan&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 10 December 2013.</p></reply>

While the number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones is estimated at between 25 and 30, within that number are individuals who would have travelled to Libya and other Arab States to take part in the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring which began in December 2010. Some of these individuals are known to have returned and three have died in the conflicts. </p><p>  This phenomenon is one to which Ireland gave priority during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. In that connection Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the Member States to carry out a review of the EU Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism.  A primary point of focus in this review is the foreign fighter issue. A number of initiatives at EU level have been developed to combat this phenomenon including community relations initiatives, media campaigns, enhanced tracking of movements, engagement with third countries (notably Turkey) and engagement with internet service providers to curb radical online content.  </p><p>  In Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour and in line with best practice internationally has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas. In tandem with that, the Garda&iacute; operate a progressive community relations programme through its Racial Inter-Cultural and Diversity Office. That office is in regular contact with our minority communities and recently received favourable comment on its operation from the UN Counter Terrorism Committee.  It is of course essential that at times like this entire communities do not get stigmatised because of the actions of a few. It has to be recognised that the vast majority of people in our communities wish only to go about their daily lives in peace.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that I recently published new legislation in the form of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014.  The Bill will transpose into Irish law an EU Council Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2008/919/JHA).  In particular, the Bill, when enacted will amend the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 to create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.  </p></reply>

It is intended to give children legal certainty and security in their family structures, and to ensure that children's rights are vindicated in areas concerning parentage, guardianship, custody and access.<br/><br/>The General Scheme proposes, in summary, to:<br/><br/>- modernise the law regarding the parental rights of children living in diverse family forms;<br/><br/>- establish that the best interests of the child are paramount in decisions on custody, guardianship and access;<br/><br/>- set out how parentage is to be assigned in cases of assisted reproduction;<br/><br/>- extend automatic guardianship to non-marital fathers who have lived with the child's mother for at least 12 months, including 3 months following the child's birth;<br/><br/>- enable civil partnered or cohabiting couples to be eligible jointly to adopt a child;<br/><br/>- allow civil partners, step-parents, those cohabiting with the biological parent and those acting in loco parentis for a specified period to apply for guardianship and custody;<br/><br/>- enable members of the wider family to apply for access to the child;<br/><br/>- put in place a series of provisions on making parenting work.<br/><br/>There were, according to Census 2011, 49,005 households of cohabiting couples with children under 15 in 2011 and I am of the view that our laws must be modernised to reflect the realities of modern family diversity.  I understand that people will have different personal views and concerns regarding the proposed legislation.  However, it is important that children's rights should be safeguarded regardless of the family type in which they are living.  This is what this legislation is seeking to achieve.</p></reply>

Similarly, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Strategy Statement for 2013-2015 incorporates road safety as one of its key objectives through the use of targeted hi-visibility enforcement measures, as well as education and prevention programmes.  Performance against these objectives, as for other areas of police activity, is managed and assessed on an ongoing basis by the Garda authorities and publicly reported on in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Report.  The 2013 Reports sets out the extent of Garda enforcement and prevention operations for the year and in this context I have no plans to commission a separate assessment of the type referred to by the Deputy.  </p><p>  While the increase in the number of road deaths in 2013 over 2012 is worrying, fatalities remain far lower than they were just a few years ago.  I am in ongoing contact with the Garda authorities in relation to enforcement activity and can assure him that is remains determined and focused on the areas of greatest risk.  I am also continuing to work closely with my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and other relevant agencies and institutions to advance road safety generally as part of the Government's overall Road Safety Strategy.</p></reply>

I should also say in order to give the fullest picture as possible, an independent value for money review (VFM) of the direct provision system in 2010 concluded that any alternative system (which would require payment of rent allowances, welfare and related payments, etc.) would cost the State twice the amount of the direct provision system. Moreover, this cost would not have included the potential additional expenditure that would arise from the strong likelihood of the significant pull factor that would emerge from a cash-based system. </p></reply>

Community policing is the underpinning philosophy and ethos through which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na delivers a service across the country.

The Commissioner estimated that there are 61,000 more man hours available for frontline services following the station closures.</p><p>  There are currently over 2,000 full-time-equivalent civilian support staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Civilian staff provide vital support services in a wide range of areas, such as human resources, training &amp;amp; development, IT and telecommunications, finance and procurement, internal audit, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services. In doing so, they release highly trained Garda&iacute; from administrative tasks to operational policing.</p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement provides that a review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be undertaken to &ldquo;review and make recommendations on the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the resources available to it, with the objective of achieving and maintaining the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration&quot;.  The review which is underway will provide an opportunity to consider the scope for further civilianisation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

However, I wish to advise the Deputy that it is not feasible to provide all the information sought by him in relation to appointments since March 2011 to State Boards under my remit.<br/><br/>In relation to the public advertising of vacancies and the credentials of those appointed, the Deputy will be aware that there are many constraining factors which impact on the filling of vacancies to State Boards. Board vacancies are not always advertised on PAS. Many are advertised on the Department's website or the websites of the organisations concerned. The Deputy will also be aware that there are many cases where legislation requires that a vacancy must be filled by candidates holding certain qualifications or must be nominated by certain prescribed bodies and in such instances public advertisement of the vacancy is usually not necessary.  In relation to the person who recommended each appointment I wish to advise the Deputy that where vacancies were advertised the appointment was based on applications received and in instances where nominations were required the appointment was based on the nominations received from bodies set out in the relevant legislation. Other than that I am not not in a position to provide further information as in order to do so it would be necessary to disaggregate every single appointment made since 2011 and that the resources are simply not available to undertake this task.  However, to the extent possible I have provided below a narrative account of the vacancies filled since 2011 and the manner in which they were filled.<br/><br/>The Deputy may wish to note that the term 'State Boards' is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.<br/><br/><b><i>Charities Regulatory Authority Board</i></b><br/><br/>Expressions of interest for appointment to the Board of the Charities Regulatory Authority were sought through the Public Appointments Service.  Sixteen appointments were subsequently made to the Board of the Authority; thirteen of those appointed applied through the Public Appointments Service.<br/><br/><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management</i></b><br/><br/>One appointment was made to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management.  The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.<br/><br/>The Deputy should note that responsibility for the Children Detention Schools Board of Management moved to the Department for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January 2012.<br/><br/><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board</i></b><br/><br/>There are currently nine vacancies on the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Following an invitation to the public to submit expressions of interest, a total of forty-four applications were received.  I expect to make appointments to these positions in the near future.<br/><br/><b><i>Courts Service Board</i></b><br/><br/>The Courts Service Board has seventeen members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice. There have been twenty appointments, three of which were individuals nominated by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. including a civil servant from my Department.<br/><br/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board</i></b><br/><br/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government and consists of a Chairperson, a member nominated by the representatives associations and a member nominated by the Government.  The Chairperson is appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in agreement with the representative association.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board was reappointed on the 30 September, 2014, for the duration of period ending 30 June, 2017. Seven appointments were made to the board since March 2011.<br/><br/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board</i></b><br/><br/>Nine appointments were made to board on 10 April 2012. These positions were not advertised.  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only had a few outstanding cases on hands at that time.  The outstanding cases have now been finalised and the necessary steps to close the Board are now being put in place. The 9th appointee is a civil servant.<br/><br/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission</i></b><br/><br/>The Commission consists of three members, a Chairman and two members.  These positions were advertised through the Public Appointments Service following which 40 applications were received.  Three candidates were selected by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. and approved by Government as having the appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise for the relevant roles.<br/><br/><b><i>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission</i></b><br/><br/>On 8 September 2011, the Government decided to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to establish a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way. The 14 outgoing members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012.<br/><br/>In the case of the Human Rights Commission three Commissioners were appointed by a Government Decision on the 20 December 2011 and their term expired on 31 May 2012.  In November 2012, advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; members appeared in the media. The fourteen Members Designate of the new Commission were selected in April 2013 in a process independent of Government and appointed initially to the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission on an interim basis so that the two organisations could begin to operate as a cohesive whole. Following this experience, it was decided that the Public Appointments Service (PAS) should be responsible henceforth for selection of Commissioners, including Chief Commissioner post.<br/><br/>The Government appointed the fourteen individuals as Members Designate of the Human Rights Commission in advance of the enactment and commencement of the required legislation. On 31 May 2013 the then Minister for Justice and Equality Mr Alan Shatter T.D. appointed twelve of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended.<br/><br/>Emily Logan was recently nominated by PAS as Chief Commissioner of the IHREC and at a Government meeting of the 23 July 2014 Ms Logan was appointed on an interim basis as President of the Human Rights Commission pursuant to section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000. She was also appointed as Chair of the Equality Authority pursuant to section 41 and 42 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.<br/><br/>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 passed both Houses of the Oireachtas and was signed by the President on the 27 July 2014. It is expected that Ms. Logan's formal appointment and the formal appointment of the other fourteen members designate of the new IHREC will then be made by the President following the passing of motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board</i></b><br/><br/>Twelve appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The Board consists of ten members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Five of the appointments were individuals nominated by myself or my predecessor Deputy Shatter.<br/><br/><b><i>Legal Aid Board</i></b><br/><br/>Fifteen appointments were made to this Board, nine of which were civil or public servants.<br/><br/><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board</i></b><br/><br/>Five appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.  The Chairperson should have at least 10 years experience as a practising barrister/solicitor ending immediately before his/her appointment or shall be a judge or former judge of the Circuit Court, High Court or Supreme Court.  The Board should consist of one ordinary member and at least one approved medical officer.  Individuals are appointed by the Minister on foot of their experience and expertise which is invaluable to the work of the Board.<br/><br/><b><i>National Disability Authority (NDA)</i></b><br/><br/>Fourteen appointments were made to the National Disability Authority (NDA).  Appointments to the Board were made from nominations of relevant Ministers, as prescribed in the National Disability Authority Act 1999 (the Act), an elected member of the staff of the NDA (also a requirement of the Act) and respondents to publicly advertised calls for expressions of interest (in line with Government Decision S180/20/10/1424 of April 2011). The Act also stipulates that in making appointments &quot;<i>the Minister shall have regard to the objective that a majority of the Authority would be persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers, and, in the case of each member of the Authority, that he or she would have knowledge or experience, either directly or indirectly, of matters pertaining to disability or of any other subject which in the opinion of the Minister would be of assistance to the Authority in the performance of its functions&quot;.</i>The Act also makes reference to the objective that not less than 5 women and 5 men be appointed to the Board; and to the desirability that its members would include persons from both rural and urban areas.<br/><br/><b><i>Parole Board</i></b><br/><br/>Eleven appointments made to the Parole Board.  Individuals are appointed by the Minister on foot of their experience and expertise which is invaluable to the work of the Board.<br/><br/><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board</i></b><br/><br/>The Government appointed four people on 3 April 2012.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. The Board may consist of as many members as are necessary for the expeditious discharge of its functions. The Chairman must be a practising barrister or solicitor of at least seven years' standing.<br/><br/><b><i>Private Security Authority (PSA)</i></b><br/><br/>Eleven appointments were made to the Board, out of which seven positions were publicly advertised on the Public Appointments Service and Department of Justice and Equality websites.  The remaining four positions in accordance with Section 7 of the Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) were nominated representatives from my own Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSA itself.  Of the positions publicly advertised the legislation specifies that two members should be representatives of employers in the private security industry, two members should be representatives of employees of employers in the private security industry and one member should be a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than five years standing.  Following the public advertisement process, six members, including the Chairman were appointed and one discretionary appointment was made by the then Minister.<br/><br/><b><i>Property Registration Authority</i></b><br/><br/>Eight appointments were made to the Property Registration Authority.  Following an invitation to the public to submit expressions of interest, a total of 84 applications were received. Four of the eight appointments were public applicants. Of the remaining four appointments made, in accordance with the relevant legislation, one is a nominee of the Law Society, one is a nominee of the Bar Council, one is the elected Property Registration Authority staff representative, and one is an Officer of the Minister.<br/><br/><b><i>Property Services Appeal Board</i></b><br/><br/>The Government made six appointments after seeking expressions of interest of which my Department received 41 applications.  Those appointed were public applicants.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.<br/><br/><b><i>Property Services Regulatory Authority</i></b><br/><br/>Eleven appointments were made to the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA).  My Department received 114 applications after seeking expressions of interest from members of the public.  Nine of those appointed were public applicants, one is a civil servant and the Chairperson, who was a member of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Implementation Team, was appointed in order to provide continuity to the Authority which had operated on a non-statutory basis for a number of years. The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.</p></reply>

This requirement will apply to new services from September 2014.<br/><br/>In addition to the general requirement for a Level 5 qualification, pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school provision to children in the age category 3 years 2 months to 4 years 7 months under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will have to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent, by September 2015. <br/><br/>In 2013, &euro;0.9 million was made available to my Department to support existing staff working  in the childcare sector to meet the new requirements.  As a result, my Department agreed to increase the annual grant funding provided in 2013 to Early Childhood Ireland, a national voluntary organisation that promotes quality care and education for young children, in return for the provision of additional accredited training for existing childcare staff.  The objective of the  funding is to ensure that all existing staff are in a position to meet the minimum Level 5 qualification requirement to enable them to continue to work in the childcare sector and that staff seeking to fill the role of Pre-school Leader under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme are assisted to obtain the required Level 6 qualification.  <br/><br/>To further support childcare staff, the Learner Fund was launched in March this year.  The Fund, which is being administered by Pobal with the help of local City and County Childcare Committees, has a total allocation of &euro;3 million for the years 2014 and 2015 and is being targeted to subsidise the cost for childcare staff who are required to undertake accredited Level 5 and Level 6 courses. <br/><br/>The funding provided under both initiatives will be drawn down in 2014 and 2015 to support staff seeking to meet the new qualification requirements.

Given the scale of funding provided to this sector, it is critical that the HSE ensures that it delivers measurable value for this funding.  </p><p>  Recommendations on the restructuring of service delivery and the implementation of a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use are set out in the Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland.  Responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations lies with the HSE in the first instance.  </p><p>  The VFM Review noted that it was difficult to make any conclusive recommendations on mergers and that savings may vary on a case by case basis.  The Review did however identify significant opportunities to achieve savings in agencies' unit cost base and to reduce average costs across the sector.  Savings in management/administration costs would be a component in this overall cost reduction.  </p><p>  A Steering Group has been established to oversee the process of implementing the Review's recommendations and a number of Working Groups are also in place to support VFM implementation, one of which is focusing on Governance and Service Arrangements.  This group's terms of reference include:</p><p>- Streamline governance arrangements and maximise optimum efficiency by implementing a reconfigured governance and accountability framework for the disability service programme including revised Service Arrangements / Grant Agreements; and</p><p>- Put in place the necessary systems and protocols to ensure full accountability and transparency for all funding allocated from the health vote to the disability services programme.</p><p>  These new arrangements are helping to shape and drive the disability services programme and will ultimately lead to achieving optimal efficiency in the delivery of the programme.</p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies.  The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2014 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6 m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter.</p></reply>

It is recognised that alone <i>no single initiative</i>will reverse the growing obesity trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  The Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO) is concentrating on a range of measures such as calorie posting in restaurants, a choice of healthy foods and drinks in vending machines in post-primary schools; food labelling options; Treatment Algorithms for adults and children and opportunistic screening and monitoring for earlier detection of overweight and obesity in children.  The Department of Health has worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, with regard to the marketing of food and drink to children for the revised Children's Code to restrict marketing of high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drinks.  The current Food Pyramid guidelines on carbohydrates and fat are being reviewed by the Health Research Board and results will be presented to the Special Action Group on Obesity later this month for comment and modification, if necessary.<br/><br/>An EU-wide Joint Action to facilitate implementation of The EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity will commence in March 2015 and end in early 2017.  Ireland will lead on a Work Package which focuses on <i>'The cost of Childhood Obesity in Europe and forecasting the increase in the burden of disease arising from childhood obesity in the EU by 2020'.  </i>A Report and Recommendations of the Special Action Group on Obesity Working Group to reduce consumption of high fat, salt and sugar foods and drinks from the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid has been prepared and is being considered under the Healthy Ireland framework.  Work is now ongoing on progressing the Recommendations.  <br/><br/>A new Obesity Policy in now under development and will be finalised in 2015.</p></reply>

There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). <br/><br/>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. <br/><br/>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine (Fampyra&reg;) in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br/><br/>On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br/><br/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both. <br/><br/>A revised application was received by the HSE on 25th July 2014 and is currently being considered in line with the agreed procedures and timescales.  No further comment is possible at this time as the HSE decision making process is ongoing.</p></reply>

In the current system, all persons aged under 55 are covered after 26 weeks of joining for illnesses that commence after taking out health insurance.  Those aged over 55 have longer waiting periods.  The provisions on waiting periods help to support community rating.  Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.  This system requires &lsquo;intergenerational solidarity&rsquo;, where younger people pay more for health insurance than the level of risk they present would demand, while older people pay less as a direct consequence.<br/><br/>The provision of waiting periods helps to encourage individuals to take out health insurance earlier in life, thus minimising the strain placed on the community rating system and ultimately benefitting the entire pool of insured persons in the community.</p></reply>

I am in no way personally involved in decisions about individual patients, members of staff or contractors.  I have had no role in this matter which is one for the HSE and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene regardless of political pressure or lobbying.  I hope you can understand and respect why that is.</p><p>  With regard to this case, I understand from the HSE that her indemnity has been suspended temporarily due to specific and serious concerns expressed by other clinical staff about patient safety.  When the HSE suspends an individual as precautionary measure subject to a review/investigation, it does not do so lightly.  An overall competence and performance review is planned.  I hope this be done as expediently as possible.</p><p>  On the broader issue, pregnancy is not a disease but a physiological condition and there is no reason why women with a normal pregnancy, should not have their baby delivered at home by a community midwife or in a midwife-led unit.  It should be a mother&rsquo;s choice within safe guidelines.  This will form part of the general review of maternity services being carried out over the course of the next twelve months.</p></reply>

All tobacco products have been shown to negatively affect health and as such it was considered appropriate that all tobacco products should be treated equally under the Bill.<br/><br/>The preamble to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), which Ireland has signed and ratified, states that there is no distinction made between tobacco products and the harm that they cause.  Article 11 of the FCTC concerns the packaging and labelling of tobacco products, and the guidelines issued by the WHO for its implementation request that Parties to the Treaty consider adopting standardised packaging for all tobacco products: &ldquo;Parties should ensure that the packaging and labelling provisions related to Article 11 of the Convention apply equally to <i>all</i>tobacco products sold within the jurisdiction.&rdquo;<br/><br/>There is a wealth of experience internationally that shows the necessity for a comprehensive approach in tobacco control.  The evidence base shows that standardised packaging will impact on the consumption of tobacco products, including cigars, in that it will reduce the appeal of tobacco products and will encourage cessation, whilst at the same time reducing the ability of the packaging of each of these products to mislead consumers about the harmful effects of smoking.<br/><br/>As Deputy has pointed out, the UK has not included cigars and pipe tobacco in their draft standardised packaging regulations.  If the UK decides to go ahead with this initiative the resulting regulations will be made under their Children and Families Act 2014.  The proposed Irish legislation is not confined to any specific age group.  From a public health perspective, Ireland has taken the decision to reduce smoking of all tobacco products, and not just cigarettes, to a prevalence rate of less than 5% by 2025.  All smokers, irrespective of the type of product they consume deserve the same level of protection as do those who consume cigarettes.  The standardised or plain packaging legislation already introduced in Australia covers all tobacco products, including cigars.</p></reply>

In line with Programme for Government commitments, &euro;90 million and some 1,100 additional posts have been provided since 2012, to develop Community Mental Health Teams and Suicide Prevention resources.  In addition, the budget for the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has more than doubled, from &euro;4 million in 2011 to &euro;8.8 million in 2014.<br/><br/>The NOSP has primary responsibility for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of <i>Reach Out</i>our suicide prevention strategy and has been tasked with coordinating suicide prevention efforts around the country as well as supporting agencies and individuals interested and active in suicide prevention.  The NOSP funds over thirty non-governmental organisations to carry out an array of work in communities that promote positive mental health and work to reduce the incidence of suicide and self-harm.  In 2014, the NOSP will continue to work in partnership to deliver  local and community based supports as well as frontline services.  The NOSP is also working to improve access to information and supports for anyone experiencing mental health difficulties with the development of the free to call Samaritans 116 123 helpline number which was launched earlier this year, and a new on-line portal, which will be launched shortly, that will provide easily accessible and accurate information.  These new initiatives will simplify the signposting to services for people who may be going through tough times.<br/><br/>In recognition of the need to further improve the response of the Mental Health Service to people following an episode of deliberate self harm, the HSE, in conjunction with the Irish College of Psychiatrists, has developed a Clinical Programme.  An important aspect of the Programme is to ensure each person is linked in to the follow up recommended by the nurse.  Thirty five posts have been allocated on the basis of the number of self harm presentations to the various Emergency Departments; twenty two of these posts are currently filled and training has been initiated.  In addition, the Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse (SCAN) initiative is being extended to eight new sites across the country and will be operational by the end of the year.  This service provides active liaison between primary care and the mental health services and enables and assists GPs in carrying out speedy clinical assessments of patients presenting with deliberate self harm/suicide crisis.<br/><br/>Mindful that schools are one of the key settings for the promotion of mental health and well-being of young people and that they are also in the position to identify young people experiencing emotional difficulties, the NOSP worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills to develop <i>Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention </i>in post-primary schools.<br/><br/>The Department of Health and the NOSP are continuing to work very closely on suicide prevention issues and on the finalisation of a new Strategic Framework which is expected to be completed by the end of the year.<br/><br/>The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy (2006), <i>A Vision for Change</i>, provides a framework for action to develop a modern high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year period.  Implementation of <i>Vision</i>has included positive mental health promotion, accelerated closure of the old psychiatric hospitals, the development of community based adult and child and adolescent services and bespoke new facilities to support the recommended community-based, recovery-focussed model of care resulting in shorter episodes of in-patient care and the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services.<br/><br/>The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service is a key Service Improvement Project for the HSE.  The project aims to improve access to and use of CAMHS in-patient, day hospital and community based services, particularly in the context of agreed protocols governing the area of 16-17 year olds.  As part of  the development funding prioritised by this Government since 2012 for mental health overall, upwards of 230 new posts have been allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams.  This additional investment is intended to enable CAMHS teams to cater for all age ranges up to 18 years.  Area Mental Health Management Teams are now also in place across the country, to ensure a more seamless service between CAMHS and Adult Mental Health services.</p></reply>

This level of fluoride is deemed optimal for protecting the oral health of all age groups. European Council Directive 98/83 allows for a maximum permitted concentration of fluoride in drinking water up to 1.5mg/litre (or parts per million), almost twice the maximum level permitted in Ireland. In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. </p><p>  The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review. As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department.

They were published by the Health protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) in 2012. Parts of this guidance have been updated in light of the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa. <br/><br/>The key elements of the guidelines include: <br/><br/>-the need for vigilance in considering the possibility of VHF in a person with a fever who has recently returned (within 21 days) from travel to an endemic area, <br/><br/>-the institution of appropriate infection control measures if a case is suspected, <br/><br/>-rapid testing and diagnosis of the case, and<br/><br/>-the management of his/her contacts.<br/><br/>Given appropriate infection control measures, onward transmission to others is extremely unlikely. <br/><br/>On 29 May 2013 a VHF education day was held for relevant professionals to launch guidance on Management of VHF produced by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC.  This education day concentrated particularly on providing a practical guide to the management of an imported VHF case, including ambulance transfer.<br/><br/>Following the announcement on 8 August 2014 a number of additional actions in relation to guidance, communications and transport were put in place, beyond those already in existence.  An urgent teleconference was convened between the Department of Health, the HPSC, HSE-Public Health, HSE-Emergency Preparedness and HSE-Communications to review the following areas:<br/><br/>-Travel advice &ndash; advice would issue from DOH advising against non-essential travel<br/><br/>-Posters in airports<br/><br/>-Repatriation of Irish citizens <br/><br/>In addition, the HSE&rsquo;s Port Health Group &ndash; a group tasked with providing guidance and advice in relation to measures in ports and airports.<br/><br/>On the day of the announcement, advice for travellers, including features of the disease, modes of transmission, and methods to prevention were posted on the HPSC website.  An extensive Ebola virus disease travel section was developed as a portal for those who would travel between West Africa and Ireland.  <br/><br/>The advice document <i>Advice for healthcare workers, including humanitarian aid workers, returning to or coming to Ireland following travel from an area affected by the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak</i>(most recent version 5 September 2014) was produced and posted on the HPSC&rsquo;s website.  <br/><br/>Advice for airport and port managers that had been developed was circulated to all relevant stakeholders.  This information has been posted on the website for the HPSC. The guidance document, <i>Update for Airport Managers and Airlines on Ebola Virus Disease</i>was posted on 22 August 2014 and the guidance document <i>Update for Port Managers and Ferry Companies on Ebola Virus Disease</i>was posted on 5 September 2014. <br/><br/>Posters (in English, French and Irish) - <i>Returning from West Africa? Important information about Ebola</i>&ndash; were printed and distributed to all Airports and the main designated Seaports.  They have been placed in prominent positions in full line of sight of all arriving passengers/crews in the arrivals areas of these locations.  <br/><br/>Following the declaration of PHEIC, a modified  <i>EVD Risk Assessment for use by Ambulance Personnel</i>was developed from an existing document to ensure that transport of suspected EVD patients was placed on a clear and systematic footing.  This document provides highly specific guidance for ambulance personnel on the transfer of patients suspected as having EVD.  This algorithm allows for remote risk assessment of a patient suspected as having EVD arriving at one of the country&rsquo;s airports, by an expert physician from the National Isolation Unit in the Mater Hospital.  This guidance document lays out clear procedures whereby ambulance personnel would protect themselves and others from possible infection.  It stipulates the necessary isolation of a potentially infected person, personal protective equipment to be deployed by ambulance crews and the necessary urgent communication pathways required. <br/><br/>Beyond this initial contact, extensive guidance is also available for hospital clinicians, general practitioners and other healthcare workers, to enable rapid identification of suspected Ebola patients, in other settings, and their urgent management.  There is also extensive guidance on the necessary steps that staff must take to ensure that they protect themselves and other patients.<br/><br/>Healthcare staff in the NIU and hospitals around the country have received information and advice on identification and management of EVD.  In addition, staff in the National Isolation Unit (NIU) have received specific training in the use of the appropriate PPE to be used in the management of a suspected EVD patient.<br/><br/>There is ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and updated travel advice is available on the Foreign Affairs' website. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly advises against all non-essential travel to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. <br/><br/>In conclusion, considerable public health planning is underway with a range of bodies and professionals in relation to the Ebola emergency in West Africa. </p></reply>

VFM efficiency targets of &euro;5million were identified this year in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan. In order to arrive at a fair and equitable allocation of these efficiency targets, the Social Care Division of the HSE assessed the capability of the voluntary disability providers to implement the necessary measures. In recognition of the time required to complete this work only 50% of the 2014 savings requirement, i.e. &euro;2.5 million, is being assigned to agencies this year. The HSE will continue to work with disability agencies to ensure that efficiencies are achieved without impacting on service provision.</p></reply>

The new children's hospital is therefore a priority in the Programme for Government. Services which are currently provided at three locations in Dublin will be brought together in the new hospital, which will be co-located with St James's Hospital on its campus in Dublin 8. Two satellite centres, which will operate under the same governance and management as the children's hospital, are planned for the campuses of Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals. In October 2013, the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform announced that up to &euro;200m would be made available for the hospital from the sale of the National Lottery, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding indented for this project and underlining the Government's commitment to it. A design team has been appointed and is working on design development, with the aim of submitting a planning application in June 2015. It is expected that the project will be on site at the St James's campus and at the two satellite centre locations, on the campuses of Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals, in January 2016. The new hospital will have 384 in-patient beds and a further 85 daycare beds, as well as 111 outpatient consulting examination rooms across both the main hospital and satellite centres.<br/><br/>The HSE&rsquo;s National Capital &amp;amp; Property Steering Committee appraises all projects to be included in the Capital Plan. The current Capital Plan, which outlines the health service&rsquo;s construction priorities for 2014 and the multi-annual period 2014&ndash;2018, does not include the project referred to by the Deputy but does include other paediatric projects at Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, specifically an Acute Child Sexual Assault Assessment &amp;amp; Treatment Unit and a new  Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory.  Infrastructural and clinical risks are being actively managed from an operational perspective at the children's hospitals and funding has been made available to address such issues. The requirement for capital investment in the existing children&rsquo;s hospitals to sustain and improve patient services in advance of the move to the new children's hospital will continue to be considered in the context of the priorities in the capital programme.  <font color="#0000FF"> </font></p></reply>

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and often on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. </p><p>  With regard to the drug Eculizumab, in 2010 following prolonged discussions and in the absence of sufficient information to make a long term permanent decision around this agent, the HSE entered into an access with evidence development agreement with Alexion Pharma and St James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin whereby the HSE provided a fund (almost &euro;10m, inclusive of VAT) for three years (2010-2012) sufficient to treat 10 patients (the expected number of patients to be identified for treatment over that time period). At the end of this period, Alexion was expected to have developed additional evidence to allow the HSE to make a long term decision in relation to the funding of this incredibly costly agent. The HSE honoured the terms of that agreement.</p><p>  The agreement lapsed and a formal re-assessment process was triggered as was agreed with Alexion / St James&rsquo;s in 2010. Pending consideration of the outcome of the assessment, the HSE continued the funding commitments entered into with Alexion on behalf of the original 10 patients identified by the National Centre i.e. St James&rsquo;s. The HSE has released funding of &euro;1.9m in the first 8 months of 2014 to fund treatment for the 10 existing patients. </p><p>  Many countries have struggled to accept the pricing point put forward by Alexion. The medicine in question requires &euro;355,000 per annum plus 23% VAT (multi-year commitment) to be found for each additional patient treated.</p><p>  The HSE continues to try to engage with the pharmaceutical company to arrive at a pricing point that would assist it in its efforts to fund this medicine for as many patients as possible. The HSE has sought to meet the company again in October but Alexion are unavailable to meet this month. The current Irish list price of &euro;4,557.50 per vial substantially exceeds the list price in the UK (&pound;3,150 sterling).</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department, and the HSE, fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug. While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p><p>  In relation to the administration of the Treatment Abroad Scheme, the Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The policy of the HSE on the matter of waiting lists is clear.  All hospital managers are expected to efficiently manage waiting lists in chronological order, except where clinical need dictates that a patient needs to be prioritised.  The HSE does not condone the manipulation of waiting lists and will take appropriate disciplinary action if this can be proved.</p><p>  In late 2013, a number of patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment were outsourced to the private sector for assessment and were then referred back to the public system for surgical procedures.  The HSE has advised that this practice has now ceased.  Patients can be removed from waiting lists as part of the HSE waiting lists validation protocol but GPs and consultants concerned are told if a patient is being removed from the list and if the GP or consultant considers the patient should be reinstated on the list, this is done as part of the protocol.</p><p>  A recent media article alleged that patients who needed further tests were suspended from waiting lists.  In some instances, it is appropriate to defer formally placing a patient on an inpatient or day-case waiting list after they have been seen for the first time as out-patients until all investigations confirm that a surgical procedure is actually necessary.  This may require sending the patient for further tests as outpatients. </p><p>  The HSE continues to implement further measures to tackle waiting lists.  These include: increasing the throughput of patients in public outpatient clinic, reducing the number of patients who do not turn up for their appointment, and increasing the number of new patients in the clinic rather than just reviewing previous patients who are often better returned to their GP. </p><p>  It is important for the Deputy to note that there is no policy to manipulate waiting lists.  The only waiting lists that I'm interested in are accurate ones. Accurate waiting lists allow us to plan services.  When it comes to negotiating a good budget for health, waiting list figures that make the situation look better than it really is are no benefit to me.  I will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that the issues relating to hospital waiting lists are resolved.</p></reply>

Consistent with its obligations under the Vienna Convention, my Department works to ensure that the law is upheld and my Department will assist, as appropriate, in any investigation being undertaken by the relevant Irish authorities. On 12 September, I introduced new guidelines for diplomatic staff who intend to employ private domestic workers.  This is a specific category of worker, who is employed by an individual member of a mission rather than by the sending State. While I believe that the majority of diplomatic staff in Ireland already follows good practice, it is best practice internationally to provide clear employment guidelines and a framework for their implementation.  These new guidelines were developed following a consultative process involving other Departments and State agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Equality and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As I have stated previously, there needs to be accountability for all such actions, including through referral to the International Criminal Court. The international community is responding to the very considerable threat which ISIS poses, not just to the Middle East but to us all.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, we are working closely with our partners in the EU and through the United Nations to coordinate our efforts and to strengthen the tools at our disposal.  A special meeting of the European Council on 30 August 2014 called for accelerated implementation of a package of measures agreed in June 2013 concerning four priority areas: prevention of radicalisation, detection of suspicious travel, investigation and prosecution and cooperation with third countries.  The European Council will review this issue in December 2014.</p><p>  The approach being taken by the European Council is consistent with the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters which was adopted unanimously on 24 September 2014.  Ireland co-sponsored the Resolution along with 103 other States, including all other EU member states.</p><p>  The Resolution takes a comprehensive, human rights compliant approach to tackling the foreign fighters problem in accordance with international law.  It highlights the need to tackle the underlying causes of radicalisation through community outreach initiatives, while at the same time focusing on strengthening legal and security measures.  This comprehensive strategy in the Resolution is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the issue.</p><p>  Our approach nationally combines preventive measures and capacity to prosecute terrorist-related behaviour.  In terms of preventive measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour.  In tandem with that the Garda&iacute; operate a progressive community relations programme through the Racial Inter-Cultural and Diversity Office.</p><p>  As regards capacity to prosecute, existing 2005 legislation already provides for the offences of terrorist bombing and terrorist financing.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, has published new legislation; the Criminal (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014, which when enacted will create three new offences: public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.</p><p>A comprehensive solution to the challenge posed by ISIS must also embrace efforts to promote a political settlement in Syria, based on the Geneva principles, as well as international support for the new unity Government in Iraq, encouraging it to pursue inclusivity and reconciliation.</p><p>  We recognise also the immense humanitarian impact of the current conflict and to date we have disbursed over &euro;28 million to humanitarian relief since the beginning of the Syrian conflict.</p></reply>

The Cabinet Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, plays a key role in overseeing our strategic approach and agreeing priorities for the period ahead.  The Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy and External Relations which I am currently undertaking is giving specific consideration to our foreign policy, and to how the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across Government, can best contribute both to promoting Ireland&rsquo;s interests within the European Union, and to ensuring that Europe&rsquo;s voice is stronger at a global level.  Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation in Brussels and our diplomatic missions in EU capitals play a key role in representing Ireland&rsquo;s position in Europe, as well as understanding the perspectives of other Member States on issues of importance to us.  Ireland recently opened an Embassy in Croatia, the newest member of the Union.</p><p>  Among the issues which are of immediate strategic priority to Ireland in the EU context are measures to address unemployment, particularly youth unemployment; access to financing, including for small and medium enterprises (SMEs); securing progress on EU trade agreements; negotiations on the 2030 climate and energy framework and the digital agenda.  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy goals are also clearly advanced through our EU membership, including on issues such as international development, human rights and the Middle East Peace Process.</p><p>  In relation to any future enlargement of the EU, we will continue to work intensively, in cooperation with our EU partners, to advance the accession process with the current candidates and potential candidates, and to overcome the legacy of recent conflicts in the Western Balkans.</p></reply>

My Department is committed to using its full resources, at headquarters and through the Embassy network, to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and trading interests, cultural profile and reputation internationally, thereby contributing to the continued recovery and development of the domestic economy.  The transfer of certain trade promotion functions from the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the then Department of Foreign Affairs in June 2011 gave my Department an enhanced role in trade promotion. The responsibilities transferred included chairmanship and management of the Export Trade Council (ETC), the handling of Joint Economic Commissions (JECs) and coordination with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) and Enterprise Ireland (EI) on the annual programme of EI ministerial led trade missions.</p><p>  The ETC has met twice annually since it was established in late 2011 and I will be chairing the 7 meeting on 4 November 2014. Overall, the ETC aims to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade, tourism, investment and education, as well as overseeing the implementation of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. A Review of the Strategy was published by my Department in February of this year.</p><p>  My Department coordinates Ireland&rsquo;s participation in JECs with China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Libya (currently in abeyance). As a formal bilateral intergovernmental body, dealing with trade development in all its aspects, the JEC format provides a forum for discussing issues that relate to trade development between the two countries involved, serving to further the development of economic and business relations, as well as scientific and technological cooperation. So far this year, Ireland has held JECs with Saudi Arabia (February) and Russia (April). My Department is currently preparing for the forthcoming JEC with South Korea on 4 December 2014.</p><p>  The transfer of certain trade promotion functions has resulted in an even closer working relationship with the State agencies. At the beginning of each year, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade coordinate the annual EI programme of ministerial-led trade missions. Trade missions to Mexico and Australia will take place in this quarter and I will also address the EI-arranged Financial Services and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) dinner in London on 13 November.</p><p>  DJEI retains lead responsibility for trade policy, which includes representing Ireland&rsquo;s trade interests in the context of the EU Common Commercial Policy and at the World Trade Organisation. In addition, DJEI is the parent Department for Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Industrial Development Agency (IDA).</p><p>  The work of the Embassy network, being uniquely placed to influence key decision makers and opinion formers around the world, is essential to efforts to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation and to drive economic recovery through the promotion of trade, tourism, investment and education. In 2013, the Embassy network supported a total of 136 high-level visits with a significant economic or promotional dimension across 52 countries. The Embassy network also undertook more than 730 engagements to facilitate trade and investment supporting jobs in Ireland, as well as more than 660 specific engagements to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic position to office-holders worldwide. Ambassadors and Embassy staff engaged with over 1,150 representatives of the international media to promote Ireland&rsquo;s profile and global reputation, and key messages on Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and its strengths as a location for foreign investment were promoted in opinion articles and interviews in the international media reaching more than 53 million people. Speeches and public presentations by Embassy staff promoted Ireland&rsquo;s interests directly to audiences of over 778,000 around the world.</p><p>  Further recent examples of the contribution the Embassy network makes overseas in support of Irish trade, in cooperation with the relevant Departments and State agencies, include the lifting of a ban on Irish beef exports to Japan, opening up a market potentially worth &euro;15 million annually; the lifting of a longstanding region-wide ban on imports of Irish beef and sheep meat to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain; and the securing of full market access to China for salmon exports.</p></reply>

I would further add that we continue to work through the mechanisms of the EU and the UN to ensure that human rights are respected in Pakistan and elsewhere.  The EU adopted a 5 year engagement plan with Pakistan in 2012.  This plan aims to build a strategic EU-Pakistan relationship by forging a partnership for peace and development rooted in shared values, principles and commitments.  The EU engages in regular dialogue with Pakistan on human rights and democratic principles, and has called on the Pakistani authorities, at the highest level, to adopt measures to protect individual and minority rights in line with its Constitution and with international human rights standards and conventions.</p><p>  At the UN level, Ireland was elected to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) for the period 2013-2015 in late 2012.  During our term at the HRC, Ireland is working with partners on a range of issues, including Pakistan, which has also been elected to the HRC for the term 2013-2015.  The issue of the sexual exploitation of children arose during the Universal Periodic Review of Pakistan at the UN Human Rights Council in 2012. One of the recommendations arising from the Review was that Pakistan should develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent sexual exploitation of children and their cruel treatment, and that Pakistan should increase criminal liability for these crimes.</p><p>  Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of the child, which was reaffirmed last month by our ratification of the 3rd Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  At the 27th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva last month, Ireland called on all States to ensure that children are protected and are not subjected to violence or abuse.</p><p>  I was delighted that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded last week to Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan and Kailash Satyarthi of India. Both have been exceptional global campaigners for children&rsquo;s rights and have shown great courage and commitment in working to ensure that no child should be left behind.</p><p>  I will continue to work with my international colleagues through the mechanisms of the EU and the UN to ensure that these rights are protected.  In addition, officials in my Department and the Embassy in Ankara will continue to monitor and report on the ongoing situation in Pakistan.</p></reply>

I urged the Secretary of State to ensure that, in taking this initiative forward, she now does everything possible to secure cross-community support, and particularly that it earns the confidence of those directly affected on the ground by the parading situation at Woodvale and Ardoyne.</p><p>  Successive Governments have emphasised the importance of dialogue between Parade organisers and local residents.  We have also emphasised the need for an independent body, such as the Parades Commission, making determinations on Parades, the vast majority of which pass off peacefully.

Priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible in the coming years, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children.</p><p>  The decision to abolish the grants was not taken lightly, and it has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible. The changes to the gaeltacht placement grant were publicised in advance of implementation so that students would be aware of the new arrangements before embarking on Initial Teacher Education programmes.</p><p>  To assist with the costs of the Gaeltacht placement, students who are in receipt of a student grant which includes a 100% fee grant, or who would have qualified for a full fee grant but for the Free Fees Schemes, can apply for funding towards travel and accommodation costs under the field trip element of a fee grant, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the scheme. Apart from the student grant system, in circumstances of particular need students may apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. Information in relation to this fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended.</p><p>  I can appreciate that supporting a student through third level education can be challenging.

I welcome the fact that a number of these recommendations relate to initiatives that are already being supported by my Department.</p><p>  These include the continued support for the expansion of the Active Schools Flag initiative, which is funded by my Department with support from the Health Service Executive. At present, there are 1,343 schools registered for the programme. Some 422 schools (391 primary and 31 post primary) have already been awarded their flags.</p><p>  The report also recommends the expansion of the Health Promoting Schools Initiative to include more primary and post-primary schools.  The results of the last Lifeskills survey, published by my Department in January 2014, indicated that 40% of primary and 37% of post primary schools are participating in this initiative. My Department will be cooperating with the Department of Health and the HSE to encourage more schools to participate in the future.</p><p>  A further recommendation relates to the promotion of healthier food options in post primary schools. My Department is currently developing guidance for schools on this issue in conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE.</p><p>  My Department is also involved in a number of other initiatives to improve physical activity and thereby contribute to tackling obesity. These include the development of the National Physical Activity Plan which is being led by the Departments of Health and Children, a 'Get Active' pilot initiative in schools in Galway, Mayo and Dublin, and the 'Points for Life' initiative which aims to promote physical literacy and motor skills in children from a young age so as to help tackle childhood obesity and promote participation in sport. </p><p>  These initiatives complement the continued focus on the implementation of Physical Education in all schools, as well as the provision of appropriate information to students, through the Social Personal and Health Education programme in particular, to enable them to make healthy food and lifestyle choices.</p><p>  The policy statement by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland recognises that obesity is a societal problem and that it needs a society wide response. My Department is committed to ensuring that the education system promotes healthy living and overall well-being among the student population. However, these efforts must be complemented and supported by other major stakeholders such as parents, the media and the wider community. </p></reply>

The conditions under which teachers are eligible for probation are outlined by the Teaching Council.</p><p>  Newly qualified teachers, including those who are availing of JobBridge in order to complete probation, are expected to teach a mainstream class usually consisting of a minimum of 10 pupils. This class size will enable inspectors to evaluate the teacher's ability to manage a mainstream class. </p><p>  It was brought to the attention of the Inspectorate in August 2014, that teachers availing of JobBridge who had applied for inspection visits for the purpose of probation were in some instances given responsibility for a very small number of pupils. The Inspectorate consulted with the Teaching Council and it was agreed that teachers availing of JobBridge should have full responsibility for the minimum of 10 pupils in order to ensure that inspectors could evaluate their ability to manage a full mainstream class.</p><p>  This information was placed on the website of Limerick Education Centre, which administers details of probationary teachers, following the consultation. Any teacher availing of JobBridge, who applied to Limerick Education Centre for inspection visits for the purpose of probation after the information was placed on the website, was subject to the condition that they were responsible for a minimum of 10 pupils. </p><p>  Therefore, not all schools or teaching assignments provide a suitable setting for probation evaluation to take place in line with the Teaching Council's current requirements.</p></reply>

Voluntary contributions by parents are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.<br/><br/>  It is not my Department's policy to prohibit the practice of schools seeking contributions from parents so long as it is made absolutely clear that the contributions concerned are voluntary. I have no plans to alter this position provided schools ensure that the contributions are sought in a manner that makes this clear to all concerned. It is also important that schools are cognisant of the financial pressures being experienced by many parents and that such fund-raising is carried out in a manner that is sensitive to these difficulties. <br/><br/>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government gave approval in March of this year for drafting the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2014 and the General Scheme has since been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for drafting. <br/><br/>  The aim in bringing forward legislative proposals in relation to school admission is to improve the admissions process and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent. The legislative proposals will, <i>inter alia</i>, prohibit the charging of any fees or contributions as part of the school admission process.<br/><br/>  I also believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities. Better information for parents, including information in relation to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that I will be looking at in the context of my Department's work on developing plans for a Parents' and Students' Charter.</p></reply>

This has been a requirement under legislation for the universities and constituent colleges since the Universities Act 1997, for the Institutes of Technology since 2006 and for other institutions approved under the higher education grants scheme since the Student Support Act 2011. In addition, the Disability Act 2005 (section 26), requires the head of each public body, including education institutions, to authorise at least one member of staff to co-ordinate the provision of assistance and guidance to persons with disabilities in accessing the services provided by that body. <br/><br/>  An access element of the HEA funding allocation model recognises performance by each institution in relation to access and supports those institutions in developing an appropriate infrastructure to support participation by students from target groups in the national access plan. These groups include students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, those with disabilities and mature new entrants to higher education. Each of the 26 HEA funded institutions has at least one access officer or another designated person with responsibility for this area of policy and practice. <br/><br/>  Student Assistance Funding is managed on behalf of the Department by the Higher Education Authority. This fund is administered on a local basis by thirty-one participating higher education institutions to those students who are most in need.

The report recommends that under a new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. <br/><br/>The NCSE report states that the NCSE is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with Mild General Learning Disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. <br/><br/>  In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. <br/><br/>I wish to advise the Deputy also that schools may apply to the NCSE for Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for children with special educational needs who have care needs in schools, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Departments Circular 0030/2014 on the SNA scheme. <br/><br/>  Many children with Down syndrome receive access to SNA support in schools. I must advise, however, that SNA support is provided on the basis of the assessed care needs of individual children as opposed to being allocated automatically on the basis of a particular disability diagnosis. <br/><br/>  Schools who wish to make applications for SNA support to the NCSE for children with special educational needs for the current school year may continue to make such applications to the NCSE. </p></reply>

However, my Department has not prescribed that schools must use such journals or that they should contain specific information. <br/><br/>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department, along with the Department of Health and the HSE, jointly published 'Well-Being in Post- Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' in 2013. The guidelines provide practical advice to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated manner within the school environment. The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.<br/><br/>  The Deputy will also be aware that new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools were published at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year.  The purpose of these procedures is to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. In that regard, the procedures recognise that a positive school culture and climate is the cornerstone for preventing bullying and the procedures contain provide practical tips for building such a positive culture and climate.  Under the procedures, the Board of Management must also ensure that the school's anti-bullying policy is regularly highlighted and promoted on a school-wide basis with particular attention being given to incoming pupils and their parents. The procedures are not prescriptive in relation to how this should be done and it is open to schools to do so in the manner that best suits their individual circumstances.</p></reply>

Complementing the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy (2011) has been the recent implementation of new specifications in mathematics at junior and senior cycle - known locally as &quot;Project Maths&quot;.<br/><br/>The reform of post primary Mathematics began in 24 schools in September 2008 and was rolled out, on a phased basis, to all mainstream second level schools from September 2010.<br/><br/>This reform was accompanied by an intensive programme of continuous professional development for teachers, provided by the Project Maths Development Team.  The team was established in 2008 and has since then provided professional development supports to approximately 6,000 Post-Primary teachers of mathematics. Supports include the facilitation of workshops, a national conference, the development of resources to support both teachers and students, the provision of modular courses in ICT and content, and the creation and maintenance of web-based support.<br/><br/>In addition, a two year part-time Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching (Level 8) is being run by the NCE-MSTL consortium.  Some 280 teachers completed the programme and are expected to graduate in 2014.  A second cohort of 270 teachers are participating on the programme which began in September 2013, and 240 teachers are participating in the 3rd round of the course from September 2014.<br/><br/>These two major commitments were prioritised so as to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in post-primary mathematics. <br/><br/>The new Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate specifications for mathematics are now being implemented in all post-primary schools. <br/><br/>In line with a commitment in the national literacy and numeracy strategy, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has initiated a review of the primary maths curriculum. <br/><br/>The revision of the curriculum will be on a phased basis, with the initial focus being on the development of a revised mathematics curriculum for children in the first four years of primary school, from junior infants to second class inclusive. <br/><br/>In order to inform the revision of the Maths curriculum, two research reports on children's mathematics learning and development in primary school have been commissioned by the NCCA. These reports will be launched on 24 November at a conference entitled 'Developing Mathematical ideas with children aged 3-8'. </p></reply>

Just under 90% of English teachers have attended the first day of CPD. A further 172 English teachers have attended elective workshops in their own time. By any standards this is a very high level of take-up and is amongst the highest rate of attendance at Departmental provided CPD.</p><p>  Since I have come into office I have met with parent, teacher and school management representatives and discussed Junior Cycle reform with all these groups. At my invitation, the teacher unions have outlined to me their concerns in relation to aspects of the proposed reforms. In doing so, the unions underlined teacher support for the reforms that will lead to better quality teaching and learning experiences and thence outcomes for students I am currently considering the concerns which were raised by teacher representatives, and what different forms of engagement might be considered to facilitate an overall agreement. </p><p>  I look forward to meeting with the teaching unions again later this month, to further progress these discussions. </p></reply>

This ensures that inspection may be tailored to suit the particular circumstances and needs of the school and its learners, that broad coverage of the school system is achieved, and that inspection resources may be effectively deployed. Some inspections may be relatively short and focused exclusively on classroom practice, while at other times it may be appropriate to spend a longer time in the school to examine additional aspects of the work of the school, including its leadership and management. </p><p>  In 2013, the Inspectorate conducted over 700 unannounced inspections in primary and post-primary schools and over 950 announced inspections. In addition, inspectors conducted unannounced visits to almost 2,000 teachers on probation.  Notification periods for the announced inspections ranged in length from 2 days to 3 weeks depending on the inspection model. </p><p>  It is necessary to give advance notice to schools where whole-school type inspections and subject inspections are being carried out in order to allow for the scheduling of meetings between the inspectors and important groups in the school such as the parents' association, the members of the board of management, the in-school management teams and specific groups of teachers such as those with dedicated responsibility for special educational needs and subject department personnel. Some advance notice is also necessary when inspectors require schools to make available certain records and other information about the school during subject, programme and whole-school type inspections. </p><p>  The Inspectorate is engaging in a continuing programme of reform and development of the range of inspection models that it employs, in fulfilment of its role under section 13 of the Education Act 1998. In 2013, for example, it introduced a new model of unannounced inspections of High Support Units and Children Detention Centres and in recent years it has reduced the notice period for some other types of inspections. It will continue to review the types of inspection models it deploys and the notification period for each model on a regular basis. </p></reply>

The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  <br/><br/>The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.  <br/><br/>My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. <br/><br/>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds. <br/><br/>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. <br/><br/>  In addition, the staffing appeals process at primary level was extended for the current school year to allow schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level. Circular 0007/2014 provides details for schools wishing to make an appeal.<br/><br/>  The context for any discussion about class sizes is that my Department, like all other Government Departments, is operating within a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis.  This budgetary programme has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing some economic growth.  It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth that will enable us to move to a point in future budgets where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR and class size. <br/><br/>  In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers across primary, post-primary and third level. </p></reply>

My Department allocates significant resources to ensure that pupils with special educational needs can participate fully in education.  Supports are provided for schools in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to individualised education programmes, fully-qualified professional teachers, Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support where required, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. <br/><br/>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education has advised that for the 2014/15 school year, 12,891 pupils to date have qualified for low incidence resource teaching assistance at post primary school level in accordance with criteria set out in my Departments Circular 02/05.  Additionally, many pupils with learning support needs or mild general learning difficulties receive additional teaching support in post primary schools from the schools general allocation of resource teaching support.<br/><br/>  In relation to initial teacher education, while special education has long been a feature of initial teacher education (ITE) programmes, the Teaching Council, the body with statutory authority and responsibility for the registration of teachers, requires the reconceptualised and extended programmes, which commenced in 2012, to address a number of specific elements including differentiation, inclusive education including special education and literacy and numeracy. <br/><br/>  The learning outcomes of these programmes indicate that the graduate teacher should be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs, to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching, to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils, to evaluate learner progress, to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes.  Student teachers may also have access to additional elective courses with content focussing on special education.<br/><br/>  Teachers have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to continuing professional development. <br/><br/>  My Department also funds a number of Post-Graduate Programmes for teachers involved in Learning Support and Special Education.  These programmes are specifically designed to assist all schools and educational services in meeting the needs of students requiring learning support and the teaching of students with special educational needs.  Since 2007, some 2,000 teachers have completed these programmes. <br/><br/>  I am satisfied that current arrangements are adequate to ensure that teachers receive the necessary initial education and have access to quality continuing professional development programmes during their career so that they are in a position to meet the needs of students. </p></reply>

Commissioning of this report is currently underway.<br/><br/>  A key priority is to continue to prioritise and target resources at schools with the most concentrated levels of  disadvantage and given the current economic climate and the ongoing challenge to meet significant targets on reducing public expenditure, there is no capacity to provide for additionality schools in the DEIS programme at this time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-14a.797.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014101400071#WRWW02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 to 279, inclusive, together.<br/><br/>  ACELS (Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services) is a voluntary scheme operated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) which grants recognition to English Language Teaching Organisations (ELTOs) annually. <br/><br/>  The length of time taken to process an application for ACELS-recognition is very much dependent on the preparedness and responsiveness of the applying ELTO, with delays arising where ELTOs fail to respond in a timely manner.  ELTOs which apply for ACELS-recognition are assessed for their compliance with the relevant minimum requirements, in two distinct stages.<br/><br/>  Stage 1 involves the submission of relevant documentation by the provider concerned and its assessment for compliance with ACELS standards.  Where applications are complete and accurate this stage is completed in a maximum of 10 weeks.  However, the provider may be asked for additional information and is given a period of 30 working days to respond.  This can happen twice.  Therefore, where a provider is asked for additional information on two occasions, and on both occasions takes the full 30 working days, the process can be lengthened considerably.  Stage 2 involves a site visit and inspection report.  The date of the inspection is agreed with the provider within 10 days of the completion of Stage 1 and, once completed, the provider has 10 working days to comment on the factual accuracy of the report.<br/><br/>  QQI re-opened access to ACELS recognition for a temporary period from 17 October 2013 to 31 January 2014.  The purpose of this period was to enable those English Language Training Organisations (ELTOs) which were ready to apply, and which had expressed a strong interest in gaining recognition for 2014, to do so through a revised and strengthened process.  During that period, QQI/ACELS received a total of 35 applications for recognition.  As of 25 September, 5 of those applications had been successful,1 application had been refused and 10 applications ceased due to closure, suspension or a change of circumstances post-application.  On that date, the remaining 19 applications were still in process, with 14 of those applications being close to completion.<br/><br/>  With regard to the closure of ELTOs, the Department is not aware of any ELTOs which have closed while holding ACELS-recognition.<br/><br/>  With regard to Marketing English in Ireland (MEI), the Department does not view MEI as a quality assurance organisation for language providers.  Rather MEI is a private membership organisation of ELTOs which hold ACELS-recognition and which extend protection for enrolled learners (PEL) arrangements to each other.  The regulatory reform of the international education sector, announced on 2 September, was entirely a matter for the Departments of Education and Skills and Justice and Equality.  <br/><br/>  I am aware that certain providers operating in this sector have concerns regarding the scope of those reforms.  However, the Minister for Justice and Equality and I have both indicated that the reforms are urgently required to protect the consumer and educational interests of genuine international students, to tackle abuse of the labour market and the immigration regime, and to safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers.  While this may cause some short-term disruption to certain providers, it is in the long-term interest of the sector as a whole.<br/><br/>  It is important to be clear that these reforms pertain solely to the immigration status of non-EEA nationals. No change has been made which will restrict the ability of institutions to educate Irish citizens or to attract international students from within the European market of over half a billion people. <br/><br/>  With regard to the role of ACELS in facilitating the recognition of awards of bodies from outside the State, ACELS does not have such a role. <br/><br/>  Finally, the regulatory reform of the international education, which I recently announced with the Minister for Justice and Equality, requires that the programmes concerned lead to awards made by Irish awarding bodies, such as the universities or QQI.  Therefore providers will not be permitted to recruit non-EEA students to programmes leading to the awards of awarding bodies from outside the State.  The rationale for this decision is set out in the policy statement &quot;Regulatory Reform of the International Education Sector and the Student Immigration Regime&quot;.  A number of characteristics common to the colleges of concern are identified, including that they cater mainly to non-EEA students, tend to charge unsustainably low fees, do not have in place arrangements for the protection of learners and &quot;typically offer language programmes accredited by international bodies, vocational/management programmes whose awards are by overseas bodies or degree programmes that are franchised by UK universities&quot;. <br/><br/>  The level of oversight exercised by such awarding bodies in relation to provision in Ireland has, in many cases, been found to be extremely low.  Therefore, the decision to restrict enrolment of non-EEA students to programmes leading to quality-assured, Irish awards will serve to ensure that providers are required to have in place the necessary arrangements for quality assurance and to improve the overall quality of the offering for international learners.</p></reply>

This can sometimes necessitate the use of temporary accommodation, as in the case of this school, until my Department is in a position to provide a permanent building. My Department will continue to liaise with the school authorities regarding their long term accommodation needs. <br/><br/>  The school opened in 2010 and is currently accommodated in temporary accommodation which is relatively new. It would be expected that with standard maintenance, the accommodation would remain in good condition for a considerable period of time. <br/><br/>  Following an application from the school management, my Department, under its Emergency Works Scheme, recently approved funding for repairs to the temporary accommodation some of which was damaged during the storms earlier this year. It is expected that this funding will address the matters raised by the school management in its application.  The School Authority was also sanctioned funding for two additional prefabricated units to cater for increased enrolments.  </p></reply>

A variety of data sources are used in this analysis, including census data, school enrolment data, and child benefit data obtained from the Department of Social Protection. <br/><br/>  The delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The Five Year Plan is focused on meeting those demographic needs and sets out the school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan. My Department will also consider applications from schools for funding for additional classrooms where an immediate enrolment need is arising.<br/><br/>  My Department continues to analyse demographic trends and to monitor enrolments in all areas to determine the level of additional school provision which will be required into the future and to ensure that this is provided in a timely manner. An analysis of the relevant data is currently ongoing on a nationwide basis. <br/><br/>  Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website. The staffing schedule at primary level operates on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every 28 pupils. Teachers are allocated at post-primary level on the basis of 1 teacher for every 19 pupils (23 pupils in the case of fee-charging schools). More favourable ratios operate in DEIS schools.<br/><br/>  Normally, the staffing of schools is determined by the enrolments of the previous September. However, the staffing arrangements also include provision for schools that are projecting significant increases in their enrolments for the start of the school year to be allocated additional posts. At post primary level, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concession. <br/><br/>  The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The Appeal Boards operate independently of the Department and their decisions are final.<br/><br/>  I have already stated publicly that because of increasing demographics my Department requires additional resources to simply maintain existing levels of service. Between this year and last year this has involved an increase of around 2,300 teachers in our primary and post-primary schools. This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.<br/><br/>  The main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system.</p></reply>

It also collates information in relation to retired teachers who are re-engaged by schools. It does not collate information in relation to individuals engaged who retired from positions in the wider public service. <br/><br/>  My Department engages the services of retired civil servants from time to time to perform various defined tasks that require their particular expertise and experience. Payments made to retired civil servants in respect of such work are determined in accordance with the abatement principle whereby total earnings in any year, inclusive of pension, cannot exceed the retirement salary of the retired individual. The number of civil servants re-engaged in the year 2012 was twenty four and in the year 2013 was thirty one.  As data in relation to the re-engagement of retired civil servants is compiled retrospectively at the commencement of each new year, details in relation to 2014 will not be available until early 2015.<br/><br/>  In relation to teachers, retired teachers are employed in a substitute capacity for casual/non casual absences in primary and post primary schools.  Because of the casual nature of the employment figures are compiled for specific periods.  In  December 2012 there were 174 primary and 91 post primary retired teachers who had worked for some period of time in the 2012/13 school year and in December 2013, 113 primary and 82 post primary retired teachers had been employed in the 2013/2014 school year.  Figures for 14/15 school year are not available at this time.<br/><br/>  Circular 31/2011 issued in May of 2011 and set out a cascading set of measures for appointment of teachers with effect from September 2011. These required that schools prioritise unemployed teachers over those in receipt of a pension where possible.  Only where a school cannot source an appropriately qualified and registered teacher may they move to the recruitment of a retired appropriately qualified teacher. </p></reply>

The question of applying the CO<sub>2</sub>based system to all cars was the subject of detailed discussion at the time of introduction of the new basis of taxation in 2008. Any retrospective application would not have been possible as the CO<sub>2</sub>data available for the existing fleet had not been authenticated for this purpose. <br/><br/>For cars registered since 2008, tax is based on the CO<sub>2</sub>emissions level as provided on the Certificate of Conformity for the vehicle. The level of CO<sub>2</sub>is determined at manufacturing stage as part of the type approval process for the vehicle. It is the level emitted in terms of grams per kilometre driven and is also affected by factors such as engine size, body type and weight, aerodynamics, type of transmission, etc. I understand that determining the level of CO<sub>2</sub>emitted by a vehicle is expensive and that it is generally only carried out in respect of new vehicles at manufacturing stage. <br/><br/>Further, it is my understanding that a test for CO<sub>2</sub>does not form part of the NCT test.<br/><br/>In recognition of the lower average motor tax paid in respect of vehicles taxed on the basis of CO <sub>2</sub>emissions compared to pre-2008 vehicles, differential increases have been applied in recent Budgets with a view to re-balancing the tax base while retaining the environmental incentive to purchase more environmentally friendly vehicles. The percentage increase in motor tax for passenger vehicles taxed on engine capacity was 7.5% in Budgets 2012 and 2013, compared with increases averaging 25.5% in Budget 2012 and 19.8% in Budget 2013 for vehicles taxed on CO <sub>2</sub>.</p></reply>

In order to provide for free allowances and give greater visibility on the expected level of water charges, the Government have decided to provide the following subvention to Irish Water in 2015 and 2016: </p><p>-     An average subvention of &euro;537m in each of the two years, and </p><p>-     Provision of just over &euro;400m in 2015 and 2016 to support increased investment in public water services, including the provision of a &ldquo;first fix scheme&rdquo; by Irish Water. </p><p>  This funding package for 2015 and 2016 builds on the Exchequer funding being provided to Irish Water in 2014, which includes &euro;239m that will be used to primarily fund the core capital expenditure programme of Irish Water.  In addition, Irish Water will receive a subvention of some &euro; 440 million from the Local Government Fund in 2014, which will fund water- related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and which would, historically, have been met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues of some &euro;190m and from borrowing, which will be the subject of appropriate Ministerial consents in due course.  The local government funding model has changed considerably in 2014 and, in particular, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector has a considerable impact on local authority financing. The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2014 estimates total expenditure from the Local Government Fund of &euro;1.779 billion in 2014, with income from, primarily, estimated Local Property Tax proceeds of &euro;550m and revenue from motor tax of &euro;1.16 billion.     </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-14a.831.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014101400072#WRX02400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 to 292, inclusive, together.  <br/><br/>With effect from 1st January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services. Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water, including Irish Water, are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations.  Under the Regulations, the maximum allowable value for lead is 10 micrograms per litre.  At this concentration, there is a risk of exceeding the limits where lead piping is in use for water supply and in particular where the water has been sitting in the pipe overnight. <br/><br/>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these Regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier is required to investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive (HSE), to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken.  This may include the prohibition or the restriction of the supply by the water supplier.  The procedures to be followed where there is non-compliance with the parameter values set out in the Drinking Water Regulations are clearly laid out in the Regulations.  In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time.  The EPA and HSE also recommend that persons in premises that have lead piping should flush the supply at the kitchen tap first thing in the morning, before using for drinking. <br/><br/>Irish Water has informed my Department that of its estimated 58,000 kilometres of distribution system, there is a very small proportion of lead piping, consisting of approximately 190 short lengths across 14 local authorities.  Irish Water is working to achieve the replacement of these pipes as quickly as possible. <br/><br/>However, there are a significant number of lead public service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter. Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the meter installation programme.  The numbers currently being identified represent about 5% of houses, but this is expected to be higher in town centre areas. Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared backyard lead service connections.  Irish Water has informed my Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily communications pipes, with a view to eliminating lead mains, including shared backyard service connections over the next ten years.  Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure that they can mitigate the risk in the short term. <br/><br/>The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance of the internal water distribution system and should ensure that it is kept in good order and repair, so as to prevent a risk to human health or the environment and that the water meets prescribed quality standards. <br/><br/>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER recently published its determination on the water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water.  In its determination t he CER has decided that where a water restriction is in place for more than 24 hours, domestic customers should receive a 100% discount on the water supply charge. <br/><br/>The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions that are in place.  Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas library or from the EPA website ().  Irish Water also publishes the results of drinking water quality sampling on its website ().<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  They may be contacted via email at or by telephone on 1890 278 278.</p></reply>

In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property due to the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012 suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation rather than through the Courts.

I have no responsibility for, or role in relation to, the management, operation or maintenance of water services infrastructure.  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean.  Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations.<br/><br/>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these Regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier will investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive, to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken.  This may include the prohibition or the restriction (e.g. a boil water notice) of the supply by the water supplier.  The EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water supplies in Ireland, which sets out details on the numbers of water restrictions and boil water notices. Copies of these reports are available in the Oireachtas library or from the EPA website, .<br/><br/>Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that it has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

A key element of the framework is the establishment of Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in local authorities for the purpose of achieving a more joined-up approach to local and community development programming.  LCDCs have now been established in all local authority areas.  Their primary role w ill involve the development of the community elements of Local Economic Community Plans.

The SICAP procurement process is currently underway. Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed and stage two (Invitation to Tender), which will be managed by the LCDCs, will commence before the end of October.

The IDG has met five times since its establishment in mid - 2013.  It is overseeing the development of a national Framework Policy for Local and Community Development, as well as a common impact measurement and assessment framework for local and community programmes.  The IDG has also commenced work on identifying a more cost effective approach to the allocation of administration funding to local and community development programmes and actions.</p></reply>

A working group was established to examine the potential for shared services in the public library service.  The working group determined that the current structures in terms of organisation, workforce and service delivery are in need of reform in order for the public library service to be in a position to maximise service delivery opportunities and achieve best outcomes in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and customer service.  The key challenge in the present structure is the need for the creation of scale for existing library authorities.  In order to achieve this, the Working Group determined that a new shared services structure for library authorities should be established, with a minimum population target of 100,000 as an appropriate basis for determining a libraries&rsquo; shared services structure.  A shared services structure for affiliated cities and counties should also be established, delivering a single management structure with consequent resource efficiencies.   </p><p>  The library service in each local authority will retain its own branding, logo etc., and the elected members in each authority will remain responsible for reserved functions in respect of the library service in their own area, including annual budgets and library development programmes.   </p><p>  The local authorities that are to share library services are Carlow/Kilkenny; Cavan/Monaghan; Laois/Offaly; Leitrim/Roscommon/Sligo; and  Longford/Westmeath.</p><p>  Cork City/Cork County, currently with affiliated services, would also become a shared service.</p></reply>

Compliance with the Regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building or works.  Part H of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations 1997 to 2014 sets out the requirements for the disposal of foul and surface water.  The related Technical Guidance Document (TGD H 2010) provides guidance on how these requirements can be achieved in practice.<br/><br/>  In relation to the use of septic tanks, in particular, TGD H states that &ldquo;Septic Tanks must conform to I.S. EN 12566 Part 1 or 4 including their national annexes and comply with the EPA Code of Practice - Section 7&rdquo;.  The relevant national annexes are published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland and set out clearly the performance requirements for septic tanks when used in Ireland.  TGD H also states that the design, installation and commissioning of wastewater treatment systems should be carried out and/or supervised by a suitably qualified person. <br/><br/>Under Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC (known as the Construction Products Regulation), any product tested to a harmonised standard can be put on the market in a Member State, including Ireland. <br/><br/>Any concerns in relation to the use of a septic tank that does not conform to the requirements outlined above should be brought to the attention of the local building control authority in whose functional area the dwelling concerned exists. Building control authorities are the designated authorities under the Building Control Act and under the Construction Products Regulations to consider such matters and I am satisfied that they have been given the appropriate powers to take whatever action they may deem to be reasonable and appropriate to enforce compliance by the responsible parties with their statutory obligations. <br/><br/>Any person in possession of evidence in relation to forged or fraudulent certificates for septic tanks should be advised to bring this to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is the appropriate authority in relation to this aspect of the matter.</p></reply>

A key part of this Strategy is the development of an &ldquo;adaptation preparedness scoreboard&rdquo; which is directly relevant to sectorial adaptation planning in Ireland, as it will identify key indicators for measuring Member States&rsquo; level of readiness. Discussions are on-going with the European Commission and Member States, and it is expected that the scoreboard will be finalised in due course. Once published, the intention would be to have the various sectorial adaptation plans adopted as soon as possible thereafter. </p><p>  In parallel with the climate adaptation agenda, the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development provides for the development of a National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 which is now being developed and it is within this context that Departments, with responsibility for the four key sectors, will be preparing the sectorial elements for incorporation into the national roadmap.  The key sectors are electricity generation, the built environment, transport and agriculture.  It is intended that a draft National Low-Carbon Roadmap, incorporating these four sectorial elements, will be made available for public consultation. In making the draft roadmap available, it will be important to also consider the outcome of negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s 2030 policy framework for climate and energy and relevant advices available to Government and to the key sectors.</p></reply>

In this regard my Department has worked with the Composting and Anaerobic Digestion Association of Ireland to develop a website; www.brownbin.ie, to provide the public with the information required to use the brown bin appropriately, including advice on the optimal methods for effective collection and storage of food waste. I am confident that initiatives such as this can assist the public in the diversion of their food waste towards more beneficial uses and ensuring that   full value can be derived from this resource.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  <br/><br/>The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water. Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at .<br/><br/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014.  This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as for child benefit, while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped.  <br/><br/>Irish Water has submitted analysis of water consumption patterns in Ireland to the CER and details of this are available on the CER website.  The analysis is based on actual metered data and follow-on surveys with over 3,000 houses and it confirms that average consumption for a household is 66,000 litres per year for the first occupant and an average further 21,000 litres for each additional occupant. Data on consumption patterns will continue to be provided by Irish Water to the CER on a regular basis. <br/><br/>In its determination, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months. The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later. <br/><br/>In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package. The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure are being developed by the Department of Social Protection.  <br/><br/>Section 21 of the 2013 Act requires Irish Water to charge each customer for the provision by it of water services and therefore there are no exemptions from water charges for local authority tenants. For a domestic property that is not permanently occupied, the owner of the premises will be required to pay a minimum charge for water supply and for wastewater per service.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email at </p></reply>

Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) consist mainly of voluntary or co-operative organisations registered under the Companies Acts, societies registered under the Industrial &amp;amp; Provident Societies Acts and/or Trusts incorporated under the Charities Acts. Compliance with the overall objectives of a body is a matter, in the just instance, for the body&rsquo;s Board and Management.  Rural Resettlement Ireland Limited has, in the past, received funding under both the Capital Assistance and Capital Loan and Subsidy Schemes. My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to capital funding schemes for AHBs relates primarily to the provision of funds to support the annual construction and housing acquisitions programmes by the AHB concerned. It is a matter for the relevant housing authority to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the schemes and to have appropriate oversight and liaison arrangements in place for the effective administration of the schemes and for ensuring that the investment in voluntary housing is safeguarded.<br/><br/>This Government is committed to better regulation of the AHB sector. In July 2013, Building for the Future a voluntary regulation code for the approved housing body (AHB) sector was published. In February 2014 an interim Regulatory Committee was established to oversee the implementation of the code and to advise on the development of statutory regulation. A Regulation Office has also been established within the Housing Agency to manage the day to day functions of implementing the voluntary code. To date, just over 160 AHBs have signed up to the code and further details are available on the Agency&rsquo;s website at .<br/><br/>In July 2014, the Government approved the preparation of the Heads of a Bill to provide for the statutory regulation and governance of AHBs. I expect that the finalised Heads of the Bill will be ready for submission to Government early in 2015. The interim period of voluntary regulation will be a valuable source of information as to the scope and final content of the Bill.</p></reply>

It is proposed to bring forward any necessary revisions to further streamline the planning process &ndash; which may also impact positively on school building projects - as soon as possible, following the receipt of the input from the Planning Sub-Group of the High Level Group on Business Regulation.  Further reforms relating to the streamlining of the planning system, including in relation to e-planning i.e. the online submission of planning applications, will also be considered in the context of the forthcoming Planning and Development Bill.</p></reply>

I have no responsibility for, or role in relation to, the management, operation or maintenance of water services infrastructure.  Irish Water has informed my Department that of its estimated 58,000 kilometres of distribution system, there is a very small proportion of lead piping, consisting of approximately 190 short lengths across 14 local authorities. Irish Water is working to achieve the replacement of these pipes as quickly as possible. <br/><br/>However, there are a significant number of lead public service pipes between the water mains and the customer stopcock or water meter. Irish Water is identifying the location of such lead service connections during the meter installation programme. The numbers currently being identified represent about 5% of houses, but this is expected to be higher in town centre areas. Irish Water also estimates that there may be a further 30,000 to 40,000 houses with shared backyard lead service connections. Irish Water has informed my Department that it intends to invest in public lead pipe replacement schemes, primarily communications pipes, with a view to eliminating lead mains, including shared backyard service connections, over the next ten years. Irish Water is also reviewing its water treatment processes to ensure that they can mitigate the risk in the short term. <br/><br/>The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance of the internal water distribution system and should ensure that it is kept in good order and repair, so as to prevent a risk to human health or the environment and that the water meets prescribed quality standards. <br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via an email to or by telephone on 1890 278 278.</p></reply>

The recommendations of the Pyrite Panel to establish a pyrite remediation scheme to include dwellings in the functional areas of Dublin city, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly was premised on a number of pertinent factors and I would support the view that similar factors would need to be examined in advance of extending the scheme to other areas given the scheme is ultimately one of last resort.<br/><br/>As a minimum, in order to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of amending the scheme, I understand that the Board would require a report providing the following information:-<br/><br/>­  the extent and severity of damage to dwellings in the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area caused by pyritic heave  in the subfloor hardcore;<br/><br/>­  verification, if available, that the damage has been caused by pyrite;<br/><br/>­  the background to the occurrence of the damage;<br/><br/>­  details of any structural warranty policies for the dwellings;<br/><br/>­  the history of the estate&rsquo;s construction, numbers, type of dwellings etc.;<br/><br/>­  the source of the hardcore supplied to dwellings in the estate; and<br/><br/>- any supporting geological assessments.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, the Board may also make such further enquiries as it considers necessary to assist it in considering the matter. </p></reply>

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47m pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.

Stage two (Invitation to Tender), will get underway later this month and will involve the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br/><br/>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications. The results of Stage one were released on 24 September.<br/><br/>I am satisfied that the procurement process underway is in line with good practice and that the procurement documentation on e-Tenders contains all the relevant information on the process.

Of these, 153 have been recruited from local authorities, 88 from B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) and 5 from my Department. Irish Water estimate that by the end of 2015 this figure will have risen to 693 staff, which is the final target staffing figure for the enduring Irish Water organisation. <br/><br/>The employment terms and conditions for Irish Water staff are a matter for the company and I understand that these are in line with the arrangements applying within B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann. B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has in place a competitive market based pay model, which offers market based pay ranges for all employees, including a pay at risk element called Performance Related Award (PRA). A pay freeze will remain in place until 2016 as this is a key element of reducing overall payroll costs within the Group.  As such, Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award; the pay model applied allows for part of salaries to be placed at risk and this element of pay is only earned subject to performance. Every individual in Irish Water has a clear set of objectives set for the year and a set of metrics against which performance is measured. <br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act defines a customer a s the occupier of the premises in receipt of water services.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <br/><br/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan.  Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014.  This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the billing of properties not connected to a meter on the basis of a scheme of assessed charges based on occupancy.  The policy direction also requires the CER to review assessed charges in the light of emerging data on metered consumption to ensure that the assessed charges remain as close a proxy for actual usage as possible.<br/><br/>With charges effective from 1 October 2014 Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER.  Throughout the last number of weeks, Irish Water has been sending application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015.  The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for.  This process involves customers informing Irish Water of the number of people living in a property, which is made on the basis of self-declaration. <br/><br/>The 2013 Act defines the customer as the occupier of the premises in respect of which the water services are provided. It also provides, unless the contrary is proved, that the owner of a premises is also the occupier of the premises.  The application process gives tenants the opportunity to apply and avail of their relevant allowances and t his will continue until the deadline date for applications of 31 October 2014.  After this date Irish Water has advised my Department that it intends to initiate a further campaign to allow landlords provide proof that their property is occupied by a tenant and that they are not the occupant.  This will remove liability from the landlord in compliance with Section 21(5) of the Act.  Irish Water has an ongoing engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and will ensure compliance with data protection legislation.<br/><br/>As outlined in the water charges plan, customers may request Irish Water to change their occupancy status at any time.  Irish Water will facilitate that request subject to the change in occupancy being for a period greater than 90 days. <br/><br/>In its determination on the water charges plan, the CER has decided that all customers will have their total water charges capped at the unmetered &ldquo;assessed charge&rdquo; for 9 months.  The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later.<br/><br/>Up to 300,000 households may not be metered in the initial domestic water metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty of doing so.  Irish Water has commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections.  On the basis of this report, it has been agreed to incorporate 48,000 apartments, identified by the report as being easily metered, into the current metering programme.  The advancement of any further phase of metering will be a matter for consideration by the C ER based on proposals from Irish Water.  The same regime of assessed charges, based on occupancy, will apply to apartmentswhich are not metered, as other unmetered dwellings. <br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The rules are broken down into three Pillars as follows: -  Access to information on the environment, which allows members of the public access to a wide range of information on the environment, including information on the state of the environment, associated policies and measures, and on the state of human health and safety, where this can be affected by the state of the environment;<blockquote>-  Public participation which requires that parties to the Convention facilitate public participation in decisions about the environment; public authorities must have mechanisms in place to enable the public affected and environmental NGOs to comment on, for example, proposals for projects affecting the environment, or plans and programmes relating to the environment; and<br /><br />-  Access to justice which provides that the public have access to independent review procedures that are timely, equitable and not prohibitively expensive, to challenge decisions relating to the environment.</blockquote>Prior to formal ratification of the Convention, Ireland was required to implement each provision in national law, and over 60 pieces of legislation have been used to implement the Aarhus Convention in Ireland. <br/><br/>As with all statutory bodies, Irish Water is required to comply with all requisite legislation pertaining to implementation of the Aarhus Convention.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

It was determined that the metering installation programme does not come under any category specified in the EIA Directive or its Irish implementing legislation and therefore an EIS was not required.  Each water meter has a low power radio unit fixed to the top which enables it to be read periodically from a passing van. This is known as Automatic Meter Reading (AMR). The AMR is dormant until the meter is read when it is activated only for the purpose of taking the meter read. This should not be confused with smart metering technology, although Irish Water is not aware of any health risks associated with smart meters.<br/><br/>Irish Water have procured meters and radio units that comply with all relevant European and International Standards designed to protect the health and safety of customers and the general public. The electromagnetic radiation emitted from the individual AMR meters installed or from a cluster of such meters is a minute fraction of that emitted from common household devices such as microwave ovens, Wi-fi routers, cordless phones or baby monitors. Further information is available in Irish Water&rsquo;s information booklet entitled &ldquo;Irish Water Meters and AMR Technology&rdquo;, which is available at .<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The issue of grant allocations from Central Government is a matter for finalisation in the context of the Estimates pro cess, as is normally the case.  In relation to Local Property Tax (LPT), the Government has decided that 80% of LPT will be retained locally from 2015 to fund vital public services. The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State, in such a way as to ensure that no local authority is worse off in 2015 compared to General Purpose Grant allocations in 2014. <br/><br/>Every local authority has the power, from 1 July 2014, to vary the basic rate of LPT by up to 15%. In the event that a local authority decides to increase LPT rates, they will retain 100% of the additional LPT collected. Where a local authority decides to reduce LPT rates, the full cost of that reduction will be reflected in a reduced LPT allocation to that local authority. Local authorities are required to notify the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September each year where they have, by resolution, decided to vary LPT rates; for 2015, 14 local authorities availed of the opportunity to vary the rate of LPT, further details of which are available on the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s website at . <br/><br/>The amount of LPT receipts to be retained locally in 2015 for 12 local authorities will be greater than the level of funding those individual local authorities received from General Purpose Grants in 2014. The local authorities concerned are Clare, Cork County, Cork City, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin City, Fingal, Galway City, Kerry, Kildare, Meath, South Dublin and Wicklow. The Government has decided that these 12 authorities will be entitled to use a certain portion of that additional funding for their own discretionary purposes as part of the normal budgetary process. That portion will be an amount equal to 20% of the total expected LPT receipts for their respective local authority areas (before any decision to vary rates) or alternatively the full amount of the additional funding where that is less than the value of 20% of LPT receipts. It will be a matter for the individual local authorities to decide how to spend that discretionary funding.<br/><br/>My Department has already advised local authorities of their provisional Local Property Taxallocations from the Local Government Fund for 2015. </p></reply>

During the preparation of these policies IFI liaised with relevant angling federations and reviewed the scientific advice on the two species. The management requirement for predator control measures and their efficiency is based on data from scientific fish surveys. However, work has commenced on examining the feasibility of managing juvenile populations as against gill netting for adults.</p><p>  IFI was established following the amalgamation of the Central &amp;amp; Regional Fisheries Board on July 1st 2010. In that regard the new agency adopted many of the policies and procedures in place by the various fisheries Boards prior to its establishment.</p><p>  The Head of Operations in IFI is involved in all aspects of these programmes. Lough Corrib and a number of other lakes in the western region have been managed as wild brown trout fisheries since the establishment of the Inland Fisheries Trust (IFT) in the 1950&rsquo;s, and the Trusts development in to the Regional Fisheries Boards in the 1980&rsquo;s. It is in this context that predator management programmes have been carried out in line with scientific advice. The western lakes are unique in Europe in being the only large lakes with underlying limestone geology which supports and promotes a unique habitat for the production and development of brown trout.</p><p>  While IFI liaise closely with Waterways Ireland on fisheries and environmental matters, statutory responsibility in respect of canals lies with Waterways Ireland and the cutting and removal of weed is a day to day matter for that organisation.</p></reply>

The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas in cases of clear market failure, as was the case with the National Broadband Scheme, which commenced in 2008. Through this scheme my Department, with the support of the European Union, invested significantly to ensure that infrastructure and services were made available to redress the deficit in basic broadband connectivity which existed at the time in certain designated rural areas. Under EU rules, the Scheme was required to be limited in its duration and therefore it expired on 25th August following a 68 month operational period.</p><p>  &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the NBS service provider, has confirmed that, following the expiry of the Scheme, they will continue to provide coverage throughout NBS areas on a commercial basis, offering consumers the same choice of broadband plans and tariffs as those offered to consumers outside of the NBS areas. Furthermore, they plan to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS areas, offering significantly enhanced mobile broadband speeds within the next 3 years. This rollout is already underway, with a number of NBS sites now 4G enabled.</p><p>  The details provided in the Question refer to customers previously served by the NBS satellite service, which was utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises. Digiweb, which provided the NBS satellite service on behalf of &ldquo;3&rdquo;, continue to offer broadband services on a commercial basis to these customers. I understand that Digiweb have recently contacted customers regarding an increase in tariff to rates similar to those charged by the company outside of NBS areas. For this increase the majority of customers will receive increased download and upload speeds and a 37% increase in data allowance. A very limited number of customers affected by this tariff increase cannot receive the upgrade in speeds and data allowance as the technology deployed does not allow for an upgrade to their service.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-14a.1014.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014101400078#WRDD01300"><p>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a target of meeting 16% of total energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this obligation Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewables. Provisional figures indicate that, at the end of 2013, 7.7% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy came from renewable sources.  There is currently over 2,400 MW of renewable generation connected to the Irish grid, with an estimated total required by 2020 of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW. Over 3,000 MW of new generation, mainly renewable, has accepted grid connection offers, reflecting the abundance of Ireland's renewable energy resources. However, to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020, we must increase the rate of build of both renewable generation and the electricity transmission network. Comprehensive engagement with local communities, and communicating the benefits for citizens of realising the potential of our indigenous renewable electricity resources, will be essential in the rollout of renewable energy and grid infrastructure.</p><p>  Progress towards the renewable heat target is proving challenging. Estimates by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) show that current policies will not deliver fully on our target of 12% renewable energy in the heat sector by 2020. In this regard, the analysis underpinning the draft Bioenergy Plan, published last week, sets out how an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would be a cost effective means of meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets. The Plan, therefore, recommends, subject to State Aid clearance and further Government approval, that a scheme would be introduced that would incentivise larger heat users to convert to biomass heating solutions.</p><p>  Though the increased deployment of electric vehicles will contribute towards the target of 10% of the energy in transport from renewables, the deployment of sustainable biofuels through the Biofuels Obligation Scheme will be the main mechanism through which Ireland will aim to support renewable energy in transport.</p><p>  Although biofuels from waste accounted for over 62% of the biofuel placed on the Irish market in 2013, a proposed amendment by the European Commission to the Renewable Energy Directive would require that, in addition to the current requirement that biofuels must meet certain sustainability criteria, a limit would apply to the contribution that certain crop-based biofuels could make towards renewable energy targets. This would result in Ireland and other Member States encountering challenges with regard to the availability of sufficient quantities of sustainable biofuel.</p><p>  Ireland's 16% renewables target for 2020 is a legally binding obligation, as is the case for all Member States. While the EU Renewables Directive makes provision for the purchase of compliance with targets, the costs associated with this are not yet known. In any event, it is critical that we maintain our focus on taking the range of actions available to us to overcome the challenges we face in meeting our 2020 target, and to making our energy system more sustainable, and more secure, for the future.</p></reply>

A key factor in the timing and progress of sectoral adaptation planning was the publication in April 2013 of an EU Strategy on adaptation. Action 1 of that Strategy states that by 2014, the European Commission will develop an adaptation preparedness scoreboard. The scoreboard is directly relevant to sectoral adaptation planning in Ireland. Discussions which involve the European Commission and all Member States are ongoing. An update on progress will be provided at the next steering committee meeting in November.</p><p>  In parallel with these discussions I have formed a steering group to look specifically at the challenges facing the energy sector in dealing with climate change. This group comprises officials from my Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and EirGird, along with representatives from the electricity and gas network operators.</p><p>  I anticipate receiving a draft climate adaptation plan for the energy sector by the end of this year and publishing it soon thereafter.</p></reply>

The draft Plan is to be subject to Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessment, including public consultation, which will inform the shape of the finalised Plan. These assessment processes will commence shortly.  The draft Plan sets out the broader context for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s bioenergy sector, and the current status with regard to the range of policy areas that must be coordinated in order to create the conditions necessary to support the development of this sector. The Plan recognises that improved coordination will allow the sector to contribute to a number of policy objectives in the areas of renewable energy, waste management, sustainable agriculture and forestry, and economic activity. The Plan also identifies the next steps that must be taken to support the sustainable development of the sector.<br/><br/>In terms of bioenergy's role in meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets, the draft Plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme. Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the Plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the Plan also recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval. It is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.</p></reply>

The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas in cases of clear market failure, as was the case with the National Broadband Scheme, which commenced in 2008. Through this scheme my Department, with the support of the European Union, invested significantly to ensure that infrastructure and services were made available to redress the deficit in basic broadband connectivity which existed at the time in certain designated rural areas. Under EU State Aid approval for the Scheme, it was required to be limited in its duration. As a consequence, following a 68 month operational period, the Scheme expired on 25th August 2014.</p><p>  &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the NBS service provider, has confirmed that, following the expiry of the Scheme, they will continue to provide coverage throughout NBS areas on a commercial basis, offering consumers the same choice of broadband plans and tariffs as those offered to consumers outside of the NBS areas. Furthermore, they plan to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS areas, offering significantly enhanced mobile broadband speeds within the next 3 years. This rollout is already underway, with a number of NBS sites now 4G enabled.</p><p>  The NBS, combined with private sector investment in the broadband market over recent years, means that there is now a choice of commercial operators offering basic broadband services over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout rural Ireland. Accordingly, continued State intervention in the provision of basic broadband where such commercial services already exist, is precluded under State Aid rules.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas. Through the National Broadband Plan, the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland.

In accordance with the Government Decision of 12 April 2011, my predecessor commenced a process of seeking, on the Department&rsquo;s website, expressions of Interest from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of this Department. This information has been used to inform decisions for such appointments, but I would stress that such invitations are designed to extend the range of suitable persons from which a Minister might make appointments, not to constrain it. While appointments are made by the relevant Minister, I would add that appointments to Boards also include nominations, provided for by statute, by Committees of the Oireachtas, worker directors and ex-officio positions. While the precise structure varies from body to body, in total this can amount to a significant proportion of the Board in certain instances.<br/><br/>All appointments are made in light of the applicable legislative requirements, objectives of the organisation and on the basis of appointees having the necessary competencies, expertise and experience to contribute effectively to the work of the particular boards.<br/><br/>In 2011 there were 31 applications received following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 3 appointments were made. In 2012 there were 37 applications received following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 5 appointments were made. In the current 2013/2014 call for Expressions of Interest there have been 120 applications received to date following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 9 appointments were made.<br/><br/>There have been 114 appointments made to State Boards under the aegis of my Department in the period March 2011 to date. The percentage of these appointments filled from the Expressions of Interest received amounts to 15%. It should be noted that about 30% of the appointments made were either ex-officio appointments, reappointments, the appointment of worker directors chosen by election, or appointments made from nominations made by an Oireachtas Committee. <br/><br/>On 30 September, the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform announced further steps to strengthen the process of Board appointments and my Department will be liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that procedures are in line with the new measures proposed. <br/><br/>The table lists all appointments to State Boards under the aegis of this Department since 9 March 2011.<table><tr><th>Body</th><th>Appointee</th></tr><tr><td>An Post</td><td>Mr Donal Connell CEO (ex officio) reappointed<br /><br /><br /><br />Mr Christoph Mueller (Chairperson)Mr James Wrynn<br /><br />Mr Paul Henry<br /><br />Mr Noel Adamson (worker director)<br /><br />Mr Patrick Compton (worker director reappointed)<br /><br />Mr Thomas Devlin (worker director reappointed)<br /><br />Mr William Mooney (worker director)<br /><br />Ms Martina O&rsquo;Connell (worker director)<br /><br />Mr William Scally<br /><br />Ms Lorraine Tormey<br /><br />*Mr Tom O&rsquo;Brien<br /><br />Ms. Jennifer Loftus<br /><br />Mr Ed Murray</td></tr><tr><td>Bord na M&oacute;na</td><td>Ms Denise Cronin<br /><br />*Mr. John Horgan (appointed as member and later appointed as Chairperson) <br /><br />Mr Gerard O&rsquo;Donoghue<br /><br />Ms Elaine Treacy<br /><br />Mr Barry Walsh<br /><br />Mr Gabriel D&rsquo;Arcy (Director ex officio) reappointed<br /><br />Mr John V Farrrelly<br /><br />*Mr Denis Leonard<br /><br />Mr Paschal Maher (elected employee member)</td></tr><tr><td>Ervia (formerly Bord Gais Eireann)</td><td>Mr Finbarr Kennelly<br /><br />Mr Michael McNicholas (CEO ex officio)<br /><br />Ms Rose Hynes Chairperson (reappointed)<br /><br />Ms Mari Hurley<br /><br />Mr Joe O&rsquo;Flynn (SIPTU union representative)<br /><br />Ms Jacqueline Hall<br /><br />Mr Laurence Crowley (reappointed)</td></tr><tr><td>Broadcasting Authority of Ireland</td><td>Mr Seamus Martin</td></tr><tr><td>RTE</td><td>Mr Noel Curran (Director General) (reappointed)</td></tr><tr><td>EirGrid</td><td>Dr Gary Healy<br /><br />*Ms Regina Moran<br /><br />*Mr Liam O&rsquo;Halloran<br /><br />Ms Bride Rosney<br /><br />Ms Doireann Barry (staff representative)<br /><br />Mr Fintan Slye (CEO ex officio)<br /><br />Dr Joan Smyth (reappointed)<br /><br />Mr Richard Sterling (reappointed)<br /><br />Mr John O&rsquo;Connor (Chairperson)</td></tr><tr><td>ESB</td><td>Mr Lochlann Quinn (Chairman &ndash;

Pension schemes are closely regulated under Irish and European pension law and the Pensions Authority is the national statutory regulatory authority in Ireland.  There are prescribed procedures and limitations in place governing any reductions in pension rights introduced to address funding difficulties in a scheme such as the IASS.</p><p>  It has been clear for a long time that any solution to the complex problems of the IASS requires significant contributions from both employers and members of the scheme.  The Expert Panel established earlier this year was tasked with finding the fairest way to distribute the burden, while addressing a range of other impediments. As a result of that Report, there was an uplift in the monies to be provided by the employers outside of the IASS, a significant proportion of which is intended for the deferred members.</p><p>  The IASS Trustee and the principal employers have recently issued documents in respect of the proposed changes in pension arrangements.  These communications mark the commencement of the formal consultation process which the Trustee is required by the Pensions Act 1990 to undertake in respect of the reductions in benefits that it is proposing.  Each member will also shortly receive a personalised illustration of future pension benefits.  All members have been invited to send their views on the proposals to the IASS Trustee by 27 October 2014.  The target date for implementation of the proposals remains 31 December 2014.</p><p>  As I have repeatedly stated huge efforts have been put in by all concerned over many years in an attempt to resolve the scheme's funding problems.  A set of clear proposals has now been put forward which offer the best chance to resolve the long-standing problems of the scheme and resolve members&rsquo; uncertainties about their future pension entitlements.  I would once again urge all parties to accept them.</p><p>  On the basis that the Trustee decides to proceed with changes to the IAS scheme following the consultation process which is underway, I will sign the Ministerial Orders enabling the IAS scheme trustees to amend the scheme.</p></reply>

There is no separate allocation for the LIS.  Instead, local authorities may use up to 15% (up from 7% in 2013) of their initial Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so. The local contribution for these schemes remains at 20% of the total cost of the project.     </p><p>  Details of the 2014 regional and local roads grants were communicated to local authorities on 24 January this year. Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources.  </p><p>  The current position is likely to extend into 2015. Some local authorities want the LIS while others prefer to put the funding into public roads. I think this decision is best made at a local level.</p></reply>

The Single European Sky Initiative aims to integrate European airspace management through, <i>inter alia</i>, a reduction in the number of Air Navigation Services Providers across Member States.  This process will increasingly involve international competition between operators and the IAA, as a service provider, could clearly be placed at a serious competitive disadvantage if it had to operate disclosure requirements which would not be applicable to competitor providers in other Member States.</p></reply>

Like all other national aviation regulatory authorities, the IAA is subject to regular review at international level by ICAO and by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to ensure that it is appropriately regulating the various entities involved in aviation in Ireland in accordance with these standards.  The outcome of the audits of the IAA by these international organisations indicate that IAA is performing its safety regulation activities to a very high standard.  The audits have never raised any concerns about the relationship between the IAA and the entities that it regulates.     </p><p>  I intend to have an examination of the IAA's performance of its functions carried out in accordance with Section 32 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 in the near future.  The last such examination was carried out in 2004 and concluded that &quot;there is a general, positive and proactive attitude and competence vis-&agrave;-vis safety and the maintenance of a high safety level&rdquo; in the Authority.  In the intervening period, the IAA has been subject to numerous audits by EASA and ICAO as described above.</p><p>  I am aware of the allegations that the Deputy refers to and these have been addressed by the IAA. My predecessor met with representatives of the Irish Airline Pilots Association in relation to this matter in July this year and I have recently accepted an invitation to meet with the Association to discuss this and other matters.</p></reply>

The proposal also refers to the need to take account of EU criteria on fair competition.<br/><br/>It should be pointed out that any service between Ireland and the US by a third country airline would also require the approval of the US authorities. The US has traditionally had a liberal policy on such matters and has 'open skies' agreements with over 100 countries worldwide, most of which provide for fifth freedom rights.<br/><br/>Submissions in response to the draft policy were invited up to the end of July and over 70 were received. <br/><br/>Many of the submissions outline views on the issue of fifth freedom rights, both for and against, and these will be fully considered in finalising the Policy. <br/><br/>The intention is that the National Aviation Policy will be finalised and adopted before the end of the year. </p></reply>

On the basis of that review, it was decided to reduce the maximum fare of &euro;100 to a more realistic &euro;80 for future contracts. While this will set the maximum fares that can be charged under such contracts, the actual fares charged on PSO air services to date are considerably lower and are dictated, in the main, by the market rather than any maximum provided under such contracts.</p></reply>

Hare coursing is administered by the Irish Coursing Club, which is a body set up under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958. </p><p>  Where resources allow, officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department attend coursing meetings, on a spot-check basis, to monitor compliance with conditions on the licences granted by my Department.  Veterinary officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also attend some meetings on an annual basis. </p><p>  To assist my officials in the monitoring of these events, my Department also receives reports from the Irish Coursing Club Control Stewards and Veterinary Surgeons in attendance on the day of hare coursing meetings.</p><p>  It is a licence condition that a qualified veterinary surgeon should be in attendance during all coursing meetings and that a signed report on the general health of the hares and on any injuries or deaths of hares that occur during the meeting should be submitted to my Department.  While I understand that post-mortem examinations are carried out at coursing meetings in certain circumstances, it is not a licence condition that reports on these examinations are submitted to the Department. I have asked my officials to consider the issue of obtaining post mortem reports in advance of the 2015/2016 season.</p></reply>

I have no responsibility in relation to its day-to-day operational matters, including policies and the allocation of resources to different support programmes including development loans and production loans.<br/><br/>The IFB allocation of development and production loans provides cultural funding to the production of films involving Irish creative talent, including Irish screenplay writers, directors, actors, designers and animators. <br/><br/>The IFB shares in and recoups profits from revenues generated from sales for cinema, television, DVD, etc. It has to be borne in mind that this recoupment can occur over a number of years, for example, a film project that receives funding support in 2011 can recoup money for a number of years beyond 2011 or 2012. Likewise, the recoupment figure for a particular year will include monies from projects that historically received funding support in earlier years.<br/><br/>The 2013 accounts for the IFB are still being examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, so I am not in a position to release those at this time. In 2011 the IFB advanced a total of &euro;14,375,889 in feature development and production loans and recouped &euro;1,179,854. In 2012 the IFB advanced a total of &euro;12,698,869 in feature development and production loans and recouped &euro;1,531,833.  <br/><br/>These figures bring to 10% the recoupment rate on production feature loans advanced since the re-incorporation of the IFB in 1993. The cumulative percentage rate is given from 1993 which, as mentioned above, makes more sense than giving percentages for individual years as the films can earn revenues over a number of years.Internationally, this is seen as a reasonable return rate. </p></reply>

As I stated in that reply, funding for the various Departments, including my own, are decided through the Budgetary and Estimates process annually.  With regard to the capital budget for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, I wish to again reiterate that, as Minister of State for Gaeltacht Affairs, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas. In that context, I wish to again acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht.   </p><p>  I am fully informed of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's strategic proposal to increase its capital budget over time from the present level of &euro;5.687m to &euro;12m per annum. I am very aware and supportive of the case advanced by the organisation that such an increase in funding would enable it to create an additional 300 jobs per annum. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, it was announced as part of Budget 2014 that comprehensive reviews of both current and capital expenditure would be undertaken by all Departments during 2014. These reviews underpin the Government's multi-annual budgetary framework and are conducted periodically to re-set Departmental expenditure ceilings in line with emerging Government priorities. Clearly, the capital allocation for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for 2015 will be informed by the outcome of those reviews and within the framework of Budget 2015, which is being announced today.</p></reply>

In the subsequent public consultation process, almost 1500 submissions were received and are currently under examination. This includes a submission received on behalf of the Committee representing turf cutters on the bog referred to.  In general, turf cutting and its associated drainage is damaging to the ecology and functioning of raised bogs and is incompatible with their conservation. For raised bog SACs, it will in most cases not be possible for the State to consent to further turf cutting, as the State is legally obliged to prevent such damage to these sites. There are, however, two sets of circumstances in which turf cutting could be consented to. These can be referred to as Article 6(3) consents (where it can be shown that cutting will not have an adverse effect on the SAC) and Article 6(4) consents (for imperative reasons of overriding public interest), under the EU Habitats Directive. </p><p>  The draft National Plan sets out the demanding tests which must be met before flexibility under the Directive could be sought. The final Plan will clarify these issues and whether the provisions of Article 6(4) could be applicable for any particular SAC within the broader context of the Plan, and seek to establish whether sufficient consensus can be achieved at a national level to make a successful case to the European Commission for flexibility on this basis. </p><p>  It should be noted that there have been 60 applications to my Department under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme in relation to the bog in question. 11 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation. The assessment of potential relocation sites for these turf cutters is ongoing. A total of 130 annual payments have been made, along with 51 deliveries of turf, since cessation came into force. 35 legal agreements have also been signed.</p></reply>
