The issue was discussed most recently at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, attended by the T&aacute;naiste. At that meeting the Council adopted comprehensive Conclusions which reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s support for international efforts to support stabilisation in Mali and to counter the threat of terrorism.  </p><p>  Recognising that the issues in Mali cannot be addressed by military means alone, the Council also emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and especially the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.  EU Ministers have underlined in particular the preparations for free and fair elections scheduled to take place before the end of July, and the establishment of a National Commission for Dialogue and Reconciliation in Mali.</p><p>  The Council stressed the importance of international coordination on Mali and welcomed the outcomes of the meeting of the Support and Follow-Up Group which took place in Brussels on 5 February, and which I attended. </p><p>  Following on from the important discussion on the resumption of development assistance to Mali which I chaired as part of the informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin on 12 February, the Council welcomed the gradual resumption of EU development aid, linked to implementation of the transition roadmap.  </p><p>  I am particularly concerned at the impact of the crisis on the civilian population of Mali, and am pleased to note that this issue was addressed by the Council on Monday, with particular emphasis on the plight of refugees and displaced persons.  The Council also addressed reports of human rights violations in Mali.  It is an important development that the EU has committed support for the deployment of human rights monitors in the country.</p><p>  In its discussions on Mali, the Council reviewed progress on the deployment of the EU Training Mission in Mali.  Active consideration is being given to the deployment of a small number of Irish Defence Forces personnel as trainers and Headquarters staff with that Mission and the Minister for Defence has indicated that he will be bringing a proposal on this to Government shortly. Ministers also reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s support for the efforts of the African Union and the regional authorities to put in place the African-led force. </p><p>  In 2012, Ireland provided funding of &euro;9.25 million for emergency food, water and healthcare to communities affected by the crisis across the Sahel region. Some &euro;1,100,000 of this funding is currently supporting Christian Aid, Oxfam and Tr&oacute;caire to provide life-saving assistance to vulnerable communities in Mali, through emergency food aid, as well as water and sanitation services.</p></reply>

He did so at the invitation of the High Representative and Minister Shatter to participate in the informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers which was held at Dublin Castle.  </p><p>  It is customary practice that the EU invites NATO to participate in the informal meeting of the Defence Ministers which is hosted by the rotating Presidency once every six months.  On this occasion a decision was also taken to invite the UN to participate in the meeting.  This was the first time that an invitation has been extended to the UN to attend an EU Ministerial meeting.  </p><p>  During his visit the Mr. Rasmussen expressed his appreciation for the cooperation NATO has had with Ireland since we joined the Partnership for Peace in 1999.  He paid tribute to the contribution Ireland has made to UN-led peacekeeping missions and to UN-mandated missions which are led by regional organisations such as NATO and the EU.</p><p>  As the Deputy has stated the Secretary General was reported as saying that NATO would welcome any application by Ireland.  It should also be noted that Mr. Rasmussen was also quoted as stating that it is a matter for countries to decide how they wish to develop their relationship and partnership with NATO. </p><p>In relation to Ireland&#8217;s relationship with NATO, I can confirm that this Government does not intend to join NATO.  Our cooperation with NATO will continue to be conducted through the Partnership for Peace, a partnership which the Secretary General also stated in the publication referred to by the Deputy is, &#8220;<i>a partnership that fully respects Ireland&#8217;s policy of neutrality</i>  &#8221;.</p></reply>

According to reports received by my Department, Mohamed Al Jaziri was participating in a funeral procession which clashed with security forces in Sitra, Bahrain in early 2012.  He was shot in the eye by a teargas canister and lost complete sight in his left eye.  He received further treatment to save the sight in his right eye in Ireland with the assistance of the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti Violence Organisation, or BRAVO.  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Abu Dhabi assisted in issuing a visa to enable him to travel to Ireland for the operation.   Mr. Al Jaziri has now been sentenced to six months imprisonment on charges relating to the clashes.  Concerns have been expressed by BRAVO that he could be denied access to adequate medical care during his sentence and that he was denied access to a lawyer during his interrogation.  </p><p>  I remain very concerned about the overall political and human rights situation in Bahrain.  I have repeatedly called on the Bahraini Government to demonstrate its commitment to upholding human rights and to implement in full the recommendations of the Bahraini International Commission of Inquiry.  The Commission has made specific recommendations which set out the way forward for Bahrain in terms of commitments in the areas of political dialogue, rule of law, human rights, and refraining from excessive violence.  I am particularly concerned that the Bahrain authorities ensure that fundamental rights in relation to freedom of expression, and peaceful assembly and association, are fully respected.</p><p>  At the same time, I welcome the fact that there has been some progress in relation to political dialogue with the main opposition party agreeing to meet with the Bahraini government and initiate a process of national dialogue which has just commenced in the past week. It is important that both sides engage constructively in this dialogue, with a view to furthering reconciliation and reform within Bahrain.   </p><p>  I have conveyed our concerns on human rights issues at every suitable opportunity with the Bahraini authorities and will continue to do so.  They have also been raised directly with the Bahraini Ambassador in London, and through our Ambassador in Riyadh, who is accredited to Bahrain.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-20a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022000069#WRA01300"><p>Ireland is actively seeking to strengthen its bilateral relations with the new Libyan Government led by Prime Minister Zidan.  Ireland is ready to provide any assistance possible to the new administration, the first democratically elected Government to take office in Libya.   We would like to increase levels of bilateral cooperation across a range of areas, including in the economic and trade area.   Considerable assistance is already being offered to Libya in relation to the medical treatment of patients injured in the 2011 conflict;  a very successful programme has been in operation now for over a year.   </p><p>  I had a productive meeting with the Foreign Minister of Libya, Aaahour Bin Khayal, at the UN General Assembly in September 2012.  During the meeting, I congratulated Libya on the conduct of a successful election campaign and its transition to democracy.  I commended the Libyan Government on the stance they had taken following the appalling attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi.  I also stated that we looked forward to further strengthening relations between Ireland and Libya, particularly trade relations.</p><p>  More recently, my colleague, the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr Joe Costello, T.D., met with the Libyan Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Al Siddique Abdul Karim, on the margins of the UN pledging conference for Syria, which was held in Kuwait on 30 January.  The Deputy Prime Minister confirmed Libya&rsquo;s strong interest in developing bilateral relations and in an exchange of political-level visits in order to take forward cooperation in a number of areas.   </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Libya, who is accredited from Rome, visits Libya regularly, most recently in December 2012.  During that visit he met with a number of Libyan Government representatives, including the Minister for Health and deputy Ministers for Higher Education and Agriculture.  </p><p>  In the longer term, Ireland would welcome the opening of a Libyan Embassy in Dublin, and this has been conveyed to the new Libyan administration.  In the meantime, the Libyan Embassy in London continues to represent Libya&rsquo;s interests in Ireland and we are looking forward to a new Ambassador being formally accredited from there shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-20a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022000069#WRA01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 32 together.</p><p>  I chaired the informal Meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin Castle on 11 and 12 February. The meeting provided the first opportunity for a substantive discussion by Ministers on the shape of the framework for international development after 2015, the target date for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Significantly, three European Commissioners participated - Development Commissioner Andris Piebalgs, Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva and Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik - as well as representatives from the European Parliament.  </p><p>  There was unanimity among the Member States on the need for a unified approach by the EU to the forthcoming international negotiations on a new framework for international development.  It was agreed that this must encompass the experience of delivering on the MDGs in the fight against global poverty and hunger since 2000 and the decision of last year&#8217;s Rio Summit on Sustainable Development to begin a process to agree a set of Sustainable Development Goals.  There was broad agreement on the need to continue to focus on the challenge of eliminating extreme poverty.  </p><p>  Ministers also discussed the promotion of a comprehensive approach to complex environments such as the Horn of Africa.  They discussed ideas for a more joined-up approach to building the resilience of communities in the face of natural and man-made disasters, and linking EU policies and actions on the provision of emergency humanitarian relief and long term development.</p><p>  We discussed options for future development cooperation in Mali and the possibility of resuming long-term development funding, which was suspended<i></i>in the wake of last year&#8217;s<i></i>  coup. Commissioner Piebalgs emphasised the importance of beginning a phased reinstatement of development aid in order to respond to the urgent needs of the Malian people.</p><p>  Finally, we reviewed Official Development Assistance targets and the political agreement reached at the European Council on the EU&#8217;s new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The outcome of the MFF negotiations, which includes an increase in funding for international development, ensures that the EU, collectively, will remain the largest provider of overseas assistance globally.  As EU Council Presidency, Ireland will now take forward negotiations with the European Parliament on the finalisation of the MFF.</p><p>  I have received very positive feedback from Ministers and Commissioners on the outcome and organisation of the informal meeting.  I am satisfied in particular that it has begun a process which enable the EU to demonstrate a strong unified position at the Special Event on the MDGs, to be held at the United Nations in New York this September, and in the subsequent international negotiations on the new global development framework.</p></reply>

The camp had been set up by Sahrawi people protesting against their perceived marginalisation, and demanding jobs and adequate housing.   According to reports, eleven members of the security forces and two Sahrawis were killed during the violence.  Over 200 Sahrawis were subsequently arrested by Moroccan security forces, of which most were released but 25 were put on trial before the military court in Rabat as a result of their involvement.  On Sunday 17th  February, the military court handed down nine life sentences and sentenced 14 other defendants to between 20-30 years imprisonment each.  Two other defendants were released. It is believed the verdicts will now be appealed to the Moroccan Court of Cassation.  </p><p>  The accused have already spent two years in pre-trial detention prison and there have been allegations of torture during their imprisonment.  Concerns have also been expressed regarding the fact that the defendants have been tried in a military rather than a civilian court.  The UN Committee against Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has sought to investigate and report on the situation.   </p><p>  I share the concern regarding this case and my officials will continue to closely monitor the situation and the process regarding the appeal of the sentences.  The Government will continue to raise concerns about human rights abuses in Western Sahara, in particular reports of the arbitrary arrest, detention and mistreatment of human rights defenders, with Morocco in our ongoing bilateral dialogue.</p></reply>

The focus was very much on the most appropriate steps for the EU to take in support of ongoing efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  </p><p>  Against the background of escalating fighting between the Syrian army and opposition groups, and with no military resolution in sight, it is increasingly evident that a negotiated solution is the only realistic option to bring about an end to the appalling violence (which has so far cost more than 60,000 lives) and to start a genuine process of political transition.  The Council made clear, in its Conclusions this week, that the EU welcomes and supports all efforts to bring a peaceful solution to the violence in Syria.    </p><p>  These objectives are central to the mission of the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi. The Council reiterated its full support for Mr. Brahimi&rsquo;s efforts and also welcomed the offer made to the Syrian authorities by the President of the National Syrian Coalition, Dr Al Khatib, to start a political dialogue leading to a peaceful transition. </p><p>  The Council devoted considerable attention to reviewing the current EU sanctions which apply against Syria. These sanctions remain essential in order to maintain strong pressure upon the Syrian authorities to stop its campaign of repression and violence against the Syrian people. I welcome the fact that the Council was able to agree on renewing the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months. </p><p>  Accountability remains very important, in the context of the many war crimes and human rights violations that have been committed by all sides during the conflict. Ireland has been to the fore within the EU in supporting calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.  The Council has issued a clear call on the UN Security Council to urgently address the situation in Syria in all its aspects, including on a possible referral to the International Criminal Court.  </p><p>  The role of the UN also remains key in coordinating international relief efforts to address the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation arising from the conflict. Ireland was represented at the highly successful high-level pledging conference on Syria chaired by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Kuwait on 30 January at which in excess of US$1.5 billion was raised to support ongoing international relief efforts. My colleague the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr Joe Costello T.D., announced additional emergency assistance of &euro;4.7 million at the conference, bringing total Irish aid to Syria in the past year to &euro;7.1 million.  </p><p>  The Council, at its meeting last Monday, explicitly reaffirmed the leading role of the UN in providing assistance to Syria as well as to those neighbouring countries who are so generously hosting the estimated 800,000 refugees from this conflict.   </p><p>  The conflict in Syria will remain a major priority for Ireland at all levels of our international engagement and we will certainly use whatever influence we have in our current EU Presidency role to support and promote European and UN efforts and initiatives towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p></reply>

An excess of 60,000 people are now estimated to have been killed as a result of the almost two year old conflict, which has witnessed indiscriminate targeting of civilians and residential areas, as well as humanitarian and medical organisations. With more than 820,000 individuals having fled the desperate situation in the country, the majority of whom are women and children, neighbouring countries have shown great generosity but also endured great strain in hosting those in need.</p><p>  At the High Level Donor Pledging Conference for Syria in Kuwait City on 30 January 2013, I announced, on behalf of Ireland, a pledge of &euro;4.7 million towards the humanitarian response in Syria and neighbouring countries, particularly Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. This substantial contribution has further illustrated Ireland&rsquo;s clear commitment to meeting the urgent needs of those affected by the ongoing conflict.  As early as March 2012, the Government commenced providing emergency assistance through partner agencies on the ground, and to date, our total contribution now stands at &euro;7,100,000. </p><p>  As part of the most recent pledge the Government has donated &euro;1million to the International Committee of the Red Cross. This is in recognition of the key role the organisation plays in reaching those in desperate need of vital humanitarian assistance within Syria.  We will also make &euro;1 million available to the UNHCR, which is leading on the Syrian Regional Response Plan, to meet the needs of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees across the region.  A further &euro;750,000 in Irish support is going to the World Food Programme which is currently reaching approximately 1.5 million people each month with emergency food assistance in all of Syria&rsquo;s 14 governorates.  The pledge also includes &euro;750,000 in assistance to UNICEF towards an improved protection environment for the children affected by the conflict and for their greater access to basic health and education services. </p><p>  In order to help address the needs of Palestinian refugees, including through cash and food assistance, emergency shelter rehabilitation, emergency health, education and the provision of winter supplies, a contribution of &euro;500,000 has been pledged to UNRWA.  Finally, funding of &euro;500,000 to the Syria Emergency Response Fund will enable both UN agencies and international and local NGOs to expand their reach to assist those in the worse affected areas.  This significant financial contribution from the Irish people was supplemented by the donation to Goal of non-food items from our stocks in Dubai through our Rapid Response Initiative to the value of &euro;200,000.</p><p>  Into the future we will continue to monitor the situation so that we can review the effectiveness of our contribution and assess how, within our means, we may be able to further respond to humanitarian needs within the region.  As Presidency of the European Union, Ireland is striving to build momentum behind international efforts to ease the terrible humanitarian burden the Syrian people face, emphasising the need for all parties to the conflict to facilitate humanitarian access and aid delivery to the people in need, to ensure the neutrality of humanitarian aid and to abide by International Humanitarian Law. I remain committed to using the EU Presidency to call on all donors to fulfil pledges made, in coordination with the UN and in full respect of humanitarian principles so that the worst effects of the deplorable violence in this conflict can be abated.</p></reply>

Whilst Ireland could have supported a higher level of overall resources, I believe that the deal reached at the European Council on the MFF is a balanced one which recognises the financial realities facing Member States.  As Presidency, Ireland will now take on new responsibilities on gaining the assent of the European Parliament to the Regulation.  </p><p>  The agreement reached will see the overall budget fixed at &euro;960bn.  Within that figure, provision for Global Europe (Heading 4), from which development funding is drawn, is to increase by 3.3% (to &euro;58.704bn) as compared to the previous budget.At least 90% of EU overall external assistance over the 2014-2020 period will be counted as official development assistance. </p><p>  The European Council also agreed to increase the European Development Fund by 0.6% (to  &euro;26.984 billion) and to raise the maximum annual amount of the Emergency Aid Reserve by 15.5% (to &euro;280 million), both outside the MFF structure.  So overall, each instrument used to support development will increase under the new budget.</p><p>  In the MFF negotiations, Ireland sought to ensure that a fair proportion of the EU budget would be allocated to development assistance.  The decision to increase EU funding for external relations is a positive outcome, particularly in the context of the economic constraints across the EU, and demonstrates the commitment of the EU and the Member States to continue playing a leadership role, to engage effectively when humanitarian crises emerge and to target extreme poverty and hunger.</p><p>  The agreement reached on 8 February ensures that the EU and its Member States will collectively remain the largest provider of development assistance in the world, providing over 55% of global ODA.</p></reply>

As I have told the House on previous occasions, I have argued consistently at EU level that the talks process has been effectively stalled since 2009, while the feasibility of a negotiated solution is being steadily eroded by negative Israeli policies on the ground.   In the Foreign Affairs Council in December, and particularly at Monday&rsquo;s meeting of the FAC in Brussels, I discussed with my EU colleagues the prospects, in the context of recent developments, for restarting the talks process, and how the EU can best assist this.</p><p>  The re-election of President Obama and the recent election in Israel, create a possible opportunity to break the stalemate. The incoming US Secretary Kerry has expressed a strong wish to make a renewed effort in the Middle East, and President Obama&rsquo;s subsequent decision to visit Israel shortly may provide a favourable context for these efforts. At the same time, the election in Israel on 22 January has considerably shaken up the composition of the Knesset, with many and complex implications for the policy of the new Government.</p><p>  The composition and policies of the new Israeli Government are not yet known, and many meetings, discussions and high level visits have yet to take place, but I hope very much that the conditions can be established for real negotiations towards a comprehensive peace agreement. The EU will do everything it can to support this process, working both with the United States, the other Quartet partners, and the parties in the region. The most important necessity, as before, is for a positive disposition on all sides and, in particular, an Israeli Government that can see and reach out for the opportunity that still exists.</p></reply>

My most recent meeting with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers MP was here in Dublin on Monday 11 February. We agreed to continue working together to support the parties in Northern Ireland in addressing both the underlying and immediate causes of the deplorable violence seen in recent months on the streets of Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland. </p><p>  While the situation has been calmer in recent weeks, we remain fully engaged as Governments in our support of the work of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and are united in our view, in the context of forthcoming parades, that the Parades Commission&rsquo;s determinations must be respected. Dialogue between parade participants and resident communities continues to be the most effective way to prevent outbreaks of violence.  </p><p>  On 17 January 2013, together with the Secretary of State and her colleague Minister of State Mike Penning MP, I met with First Minister Peter Robinson MLA and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness MLA.  </p><p>  At that meeting, we reviewed the situation following the recent flags controversy across the three dimensions of public order, political leadership and rebuilding Northern Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  We emphasised the need for protests to stop as well as our support for the PSNI who have been at the frontline in dealing with the violent incidents unfortunately associated with some of the protests.  The Secretary of State and I encouraged the First Minister and deputy First Minister to work with other Party Leaders in Northern Ireland to move on from the current controversy towards building a shared, cohesive and integrated society.  We also offered to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the good work done by the Executive and others on attracting inward investment and tourists to Northern Ireland is not put at risk.  </p><p>  The persistence of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, with the absence of political agreement on how to make progress towards a truly reconciled society, contributes to the likelihood of incidents such as those we have witnessed in recent weeks. This crisis will not be resolved other than by a cross-party, cross-community response. In my view therefore, there is no substitute for the party leaders agreeing on a framework for talks to address the issues that have arisen in relation to flags and symbols. These are political issues that require a political solution. The sooner the framework is agreed the better. In the meantime, there has been very welcome progress in securing practical support for ongoing programmes to address sectarianism in Northern Ireland, in particular the agreement on a new EU Peace Programme (PEACE IV) with funding of &euro;150m secured. </p><p>  Looking forward, the focus of political leadership in Northern Ireland should be on maintaining and creating jobs through economic recovery, in which inward investment and tourism play such a crucial role.  The Government are ready to support the Executive and political leadership in Northern Ireland in whatever way we can.</p></reply>

I have regularly stated that the Government is completely opposed to this practice and, furthermore, that Ireland does not tolerate and will not tolerate the use of our airspace or airports for any illegal purpose, including torture, rendition or the unauthorised detention of any individual.  This is clearly reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government &ldquo;will enforce the prohibition of the use of Irish airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with the dictates of international law&rdquo;.</p><p>  The Open Society Justice Initiative report, CIA Secret Detention and Extraordinary Rendition, is a compilation of existing material on this subject. It does not contain any new information, or make any new allegations, in respect of Ireland.</p><p>  Immediately following the first reports which suggested that the US was carrying out extraordinary rendition in order to transit prisoners, the then Government demanded and received specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners had not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.  I am satisfied with these assurances, which were confirmed at the highest political level.  They are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full control of the United States Government.  </p><p>  The permission of the Irish Government must be sought and obtained for the transport of prisoners through Irish airports. I made it clear in this House on 22 May 2012 that &ldquo;under no circumstances will we grant permission for the transport of prisoners who are subject to extraordinary rendition&rdquo;. </p><p>  It is likely that a small number of commercially leased aircraft which have been involved in legitimate commercial activities have also been involved at various times in activities relating to extraordinary renditions.   However, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these aircraft were carrying prisoners at any time when they transited through Irish airports, including Shannon Airport. </p><p>  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Halligan have called for an investigation into the use of that airport by planes involved in illegal activity.  Where allegations have been made, including by members of the Oireachtas, these have been fully investigated by senior officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In no case has any evidence been adduced to support claims that extraordinary rendition had occurred.  If anyone has evidence to suggest that any person subject to extraordinary rendition has transited an Irish airport during this process, this evidence should be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so that an investigation can take place.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish immigrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  </p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election. The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January and his State of the Union address on 12 February sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.   </p><p>  I am currently engaged in a round of telephone discussions with key US Senators and in this context I spoke with Senator John McCain on 8 February last to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bi-partisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue.  The Taoiseach discussed immigration reform when he spoke with President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election.  The issue will remain a central feature of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the US authorities, including over the forthcoming St Patrick&rsquo;s day period.  My programme, and that of other members of the Government during that period, while not yet finalised, will include meetings with key political figures and the Irish community groups that provide assistance to the undocumented. </p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise. It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

I have a deep respect for his successes in business and innovation, and his personal commitment to ending poverty, hunger and disease in the world.  Mr. Gates visited Dublin on 23 January and I held a breakfast meeting with him, along with my colleague, Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello, T.D.  </p><p>  We and the Gates Foundation have strong shared interests in global development, in particular in tackling the challenges of hunger, health and childhood and maternal mortality.  During our meeting we discussed development aid priorities for Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, including the negotiations on the development budget of the European Union.  We also discussed how we can work together, with our partners internationally, to help shape the new international development framework after 2015, the target date for the Millennium Development Goals, in order to ensure that it meets the needs of the poorest communities. </p><p>  We exchanged views on our shared priorities of reducing global poverty and hunger, focusing on smallholder agriculture and improving child and maternal health.  We agreed to continue to focus our efforts on addressing under-nutrition which continues to blight the lives of young children in developing countries. We agreed that building sustainable agriculture and offering better opportunities for smallholder farmers in Africa is key to reducing hunger and poverty and we will continue to work together to advance progress on these critical issues. </p><p>  Through the aid programme, the Government collaborates closely with the Gates Foundation on a number of initiatives to combat diseases of poverty, including through the Global Fund on AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisation.</p><p>  No specific new partnerships were agreed at this meeting.  However, we did agree that Ireland would continue to work closely with the Gates Foundation on vaccination and immunisation for poor people, with a specific focus on the complete elimination of polio globally.</p></reply>

During our three-year membership of the HRC, we will seek to add value to the work of the Council and to strengthen the institution itself.   Ireland&#8217;s approach to membership of the HRC will be guided by the pledges and commitments made during our election campaign, which reflect our well-established human rights priorities.  These include the following: defending the universality of human rights; freedom of expression (particularly on the internet); freedom of religion or belief; LGBTI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex) rights; peace building and conflict resolution; the human rights situation in the Middle East; strengthening the UN Human Rights Treaty Body System; the promotion and protection of human rights defenders; the promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society; and women&#8217;s rights, combating discrimination and Gender-Based Violence </p><p>  We will also highlight the importance of ensuring that human rights considerations underpin all areas of development, with a particular focus on combating hunger, health and education.  We will respond proactively to emerging human rights situations and themes, including emergency situations, and we will play an active role in the Council&#8217;s three yearly sessions (March, June and September) and in the sessions of Universal Periodic Review (UPR) examinations, during which countries&#8217; human rights records are examined.  Ireland will continue to promote and defend the work of the Treaty Bodies and the Human Rights Council Special Procedures and in particular, the independence of those bodies and of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  </p><p>  We will work to strengthen the Council as the key institution in the UN human rights framework, including through helping to protect the right of civil society organisations to participate fully in the Council sessions and to prevent reprisals against them.  As the UN High Commissioner, Navi Pillay, has remarked, &#8220;A dynamic and autonomous civil society, able to operate freely, is one of the fundamental checks and balances necessary for building a healthy society, and one of the key bridges between governments and their people.&#8221; <i></i> Civil society consists of many actors, including NGOs, academics, journalists, bloggers, students, trade unions, labour organisations and charities working with vulnerable groups.  No matter how they define themselves, however, civil society actors have a legitimate role as human rights defenders. They play a key role in a collaborative effort with government and international institutions to ensure human rights protection.  We intend to advance the promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society during our term on the HRC, building on a successful event held during the September 2012 session in relation to consolidation of the space for civil society.    </p><p>  In practical terms, our membership may be divided into two parts: the EU Presidency (January-June 2013) and the post-Presidency period (July 2013-December 2015).  During the EU Presidency semester, the main role for Ireland at the Human Rights Council will be to act as a lead negotiator for the EU, in partnership with the European External Action Service, on the most important draft resolutions on the Council agenda.  As a Council member and as Presidency, we will work to fulfil our obligations and responsibilities, helping to ensure that the EU more widely, and Ireland in particular, are strong and effective voices for the robust promotion and protection of human rights.</p></reply>

We also fully support the sanctions which have been imposed on Iran with a view to persuading it of the need for a negotiated solution of this problem.   </p><p>  Progressive sanctions have been reluctantly imposed by the EU, particularly in the last two years, after many years in which Iran simply refused to negotiate on this issue.  During 2012, sanctions were extended to include oil and gas imports and increased restrictions on financial transactions and investment.  We believe that these sanctions have been successful in bringing Iran to the negotiating table.  However, the Iranians have as yet shown no real evidence that they are ready to engage seriously with this process.</p><p>  A further round of talks with Iran, involving the E3+3 group and led by HR Ashton, is scheduled to take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, at the end of this month.  The United States, through Vice-President Biden, has recently repeated its willingness to meet directly with Iran to discuss issues on which they have differed. </p><p>  However, the indications are not positive.   Recent meetings between Iran and the IAEA have made no progress; and Iran has been reluctant to agree dates for the E3+3 meeting.  The Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has reacted negatively in public to Vice-President Biden&rsquo;s proposal for direct talks.</p><p>  If there is no progress on the diplomatic track, there will inevitably be pressure to strengthen sanctions further.  In addition, recently enacted additional US sanctions may lead to renewed pressure within the EU for a further tightening of bilateral EU sanctions against Iran.  However, it will be difficult to go much further in this direction without reaching what amounts to a de facto trade embargo on Iran.  Any further proposals for EU sanctions would have to be considered carefully by all member States and in the context of Iran&rsquo;s engagement with the ongoing negotiations. </p><p>  Ireland will continue to lend full support to High Representative Ashton and to the dual track approach which is being pursued by the E3 + 3 on this issue.</p></reply>

Each of these partners is fully accountable to my Department for any funds received.  Programmes in receipt of Irish Aid funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that our support is reaching its intended beneficiaries and the planned objectives and goals of the Irish Aid programme are being achieved.  These programmes are regularly monitored by internal auditors, by independent experts, and by the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  These reports are reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of the Department. </p><p>  In line with best practice and with recommendations from the OECD for improving the accountability of all development financing, Ireland strongly supports the strengthening of partner country delivery systems.  We provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committees of national Parliaments, to ensure Governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds, including overseas development assistance. </p><p>  The recent case in Uganda, where there was evidence of the fraudulent use of Irish Aid funds, is a clear indication of the need for continuous vigilance in the oversight of any Irish Aid funds disbursed to our programme partners. The report into the events in Uganda, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, contains a number of recommendations for improving the monitoring and oversight of Irish Aid spending. As Deputies will be aware, the misappropriated funds have now been returned.  </p><p>  Our management and oversight systems are continually under review to ensure that Irish development funding goes to those most in need, and that we meet the highest standards of accountability.  I have accepted all of the recommendations of the Uganda report. Our oversight systems are also being reviewed in the light of the report and, where necessary, will be adapted if any deficiencies are indentified.</p></reply>

I have always accepted Israel&rsquo;s right to defend itself, and security forces themselves have a right to defend themselves, but consistent and repeated reports suggest a routine use of force, including lethal force, in circumstances where little threat was posed by those against whom it was used.  The rules or guidelines governing the use of crowd control weapons are either too permissive or are not being thoroughly enforced.  It is notable that different thresholds for the use of force in crowd control appear to apply depending on whether protesters are Israelis or Palestinians. Even in the West Bank, where Israeli military authority applies generally, the reaction of the security forces to demonstrations by Palestinians or Israeli settlers is completely different. </p><p>  It is important to note also that most Palestinian demonstrations take place in their own home villages or areas, and relate to intrusions by Israeli authorities into their lives there. Demonstrations are routinely subject to banning or exclusion orders which render them illegal, and crowd control weapons are then used against those illegally assembled. In this way legitimate protests are suppressed, and conflated with more serious violent attacks by militant groups. The result is a steady toll of Palestinian fatalities in non-threatening situations which should be wholly unacceptable in any civilised society.</p><p>  In any situation of military occupation, particularly one so long prolonged, there is a constant risk of security forces becoming desensitized to use of force, of &lsquo;last resort&rsquo; measures being routinely or improperly used, and of breaches of rules not being punished or indeed being actively condoned. The publication last month of a report on the use of crowd control weapons by B&rsquo;Tselem, a noted Israeli human rights group, has helped to highlight these issues.</p><p>  I have noted with great concern the rise in Palestinian fatalities in recent months, including those cases mentioned in the Question, suggesting that these problems are worsening. These concerns have been raised in recent weeks by Irish diplomats directly with the Israeli authorities, both here and in Israel, and in discussions at EU level. The Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv has organised a briefing of EU Missions by B&rsquo;Tselem, which will take place tomorrow, to help draw wider attention to their recent report.</p></reply>

This action directly threatens peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and is a clear violation of North Korea&rsquo;s international obligations under UN Security Council Resolutions 1718, 1874 and 2087.  It has been the position of successive Irish Governments that nuclear weapons have never and will never guarantee the security of any nation.  The existence of these weapons threatens security.  Following this test, the international community has been united in its strong disapproval of this action.  There has been strong condemnation to this effect by the EU, the US and China.  The UN Security Council has also strongly condemned the test.  The members of the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2087 on 22 January which expressed the Council's determination to take significant action in the event of a further test.  In line with this commitment, following this latest nuclear test, the members of the Security Council have begun work on appropriate measures in a Security Council resolution.  The EU Foreign Affairs Council of 18 February agreed unanimously that additional restrictive measures be taken against North Korea.  Together with my EU colleagues, I agreed to further strengthen sanctions against North Korea by adopting EU autonomous measures which are in addition to those contained in Resolution 2087.  These further measures in particular concern trade in conventional weapons involving North Korea and in relation to the export to North Korea of certain key components for ballistic usage.  At the Foreign Affairs Council, Ireland together with our EU partners further called on North Korea to re-engage constructively with the international community, in particular with the members of the Six-Party Talks, and to work towards lasting peace and security on the Korean Peninsula.  The EU stands ready to continue to work with its partners in support of these objectives.</p></reply>

Ministerial visits around this period are organised to ensure we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, promotion and investment interests and to spread a positive message about Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  The programme of ministerial travel is drawn up by the Trade and Promotion Division of my Department in consultation with the Embassy network and the State agencies.  The final programme is close to being concluded and will be announced in the coming days.  In terms of the cost of ministerial visits for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the Department of each travelling Minister will be responsible for its own costs.

The Good Friday Agreement sets out that a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland would include rights reflecting the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem, alongside the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights.  A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared future for the people of Northern Ireland can be based.  I urge all the parties in the Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  In contact with the British administration, we continue to stress the importance of ensuring that a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland takes account of the separate and specific context of Northern Ireland.  We will continue to engage with the British Government on this issue, which is one of a number of areas where full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has yet to be achieved.</p></reply>

It remains my intention also to visit the Short Strand on an early suitable date as part of my ongoing programme for visits and engagements in Northern Ireland.  In view of forthcoming parades passing Short Strand and other interfaces, both the Irish and British Governments are of the view that the Parades Commission needs to be strongly supported and that its determinations must be respected. I would encourage all parties to engage with local residents at interfaces to identify compromise solutions that respect the wishes of both marchers and resident communities.</p><p>  Many local communities in Northern Ireland continue to be affected by the blight of sectarianism.  This can be particularly pronounced for those living close to interfaces, such as in the Short Strand, and I am acutely conscious of the potential for further increased tensions during periods around contentious parades in particular.</p><p>  Building relationships between divided communities takes time and sustained effort and investment. The recent violent street disturbances are a reminder that the challenge remains to build a society that can accommodate competing notions of identity.</p><p>  There is ongoing reconciliation work taking place, in particular at community level, and including that supported by my Department through the Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds.</p><p>  We will continue our efforts and will support the efforts of the NI Executive and elected political leaders in Northern Ireland to formulate a strategy framework and vision for a united, peaceful and reconciled society.  I will also continue to work closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, in line with the shared responsibility of the two Governments to support the full implementation of the Good Friday and St Andrew&rsquo;s Agreements to achieve their vision of a peaceful and reconciled society in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

In the course of negotiations on the MFF Ireland argued for a properly funded and properly functioning EU, with the right mix of priorities, fair allocation of resources and a focus on jobs and growth.  Ensuring a properly-funded Common Agricultural Policy was central to this, as was ensuring that the EU&rsquo;s regional policy addressed the real and current challenges we face, including unemployment.</p><p>  The Commission proposal for the MFF would have seen spending of &euro;45.7 billion on a special Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), including &euro;24.8 billion on transport and &euro;10.5 billion on telecommunications.  However, the final MFF agreement was for a total CEF amount of &euro;29.3 billion, of which &euro;23.2 billion was for transport and &euro;1 billion for telecommunications.</p><p>  The MFF outcome was a compromise, and could not fully reflect the ambitions of all Member States.  We would have preferred a larger overall amount, and explicitly argued for more spending on telecommunications.  However, on balance the result was a good deal for Ireland, and a good deal for Europe.</p><p>  Ireland will be eligible to apply for funding under the CEF once the Regulation, which covers the period 2014-2020, has been agreed.  We intend to be very ambitious in terms of our objectives in that regard.</p><p>  While the level of the proposed CEF allocation to the telecommunications and transport sectors is lower than the Government would have wished, I am hopeful that transport and telecommunications projects in Ireland will benefit from this new funding instrument in due course.</p></reply>

This is an act of political terrorism which I unreservedly condemn.  I join with High Representative Ashton in expressing the hope that the Tunisian authorities will conduct a full investigation into this assassination, so that those responsible for this terrible act are swiftly brought to justice.  Having sparked the popular movements for change and reform across the region, Tunisia has already taken great strides in establishing the foundations of a functioning democracy.  It was among the first countries to organise free general elections in October 2011.  There is no denying, however, that the pace and scale of change have somewhat slowed down since, with delays in the drafting of the new Constitution, regular extension of the state of emergency and threats to public order, all compounded by a worsening of the socioeconomic situation.  The violent activities of a number of extremist groups represent a particular concern and challenge in terms of the recent progress made. I encourage the Tunisian authorities to take all necessary steps to put an end to the actions of these extremist groups.</p><p>  The transformation in Tunisia from an oppressive regime to a normal functioning democracy will inevitably take time, as is also the case in other countries in transition in the region.  We need to be patient and, as the European Council commented recently, maintain our support for the processes of transition and economic development, with the clear understanding that the overall aim is to protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p><p>  While I had a very useful and worthwhile meeting with President Marzouki last February (when I visited Tunisia to attend the inaugural meeting of the Friends of Syria group), I have not had an opportunity since then to discuss the most recent events with the Tunisian Ambassador.  I take note of Prime Minister Jelabi&rsquo;s resignation on 19 February and hope the process of appointing a new Government will represent an opportunity to reach out to the opposition and, through a constructive political dialogue, to work for greater tolerance across all strands of Tunisian society and for the fulfilment of the democratic and economic aspirations of all Tunisians.</p></reply>

The programme has been recognised internationally for its focus on poverty and hunger, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and for its leadership in making aid more effective.</p><p>  The Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid is one of the commitments contained in the Programme for Government. We wanted to carry out such a Review to examine the progress being made by our aid programme, to assess the changed context, globally and here at home, and to set out our future priorities as the international community considers the framework for international development after 2015, the target date for the Millennium Development Goals.</p><p>  A very vibrant public consultation was undertaken for the Review between February and April of last year, which was overseen by the independent Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group. We met over 1,000 people across Ireland and in our partner countries, and received a large number of written submissions. We also undertook consultation across Government Departments and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  Since then, we have embarked on a process of considering carefully the contributions made during the consultation period as well as the available evidence on what works best. Based on this we are now finalising a new policy on Ireland&rsquo;s role in international development. This policy will be submitted for Government approval in the near future.</p></reply>

There remains, however, a threat from paramilitary groups who are determined to impose a return to conflict on the people of Ireland. My Government colleagues and I discuss cross-border security issues and the threat posed by so-called dissident groups on a continuous basis with our partners in Northern Ireland. As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement we are keenly aware of our responsibilities in this regard.     When I met with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Ms. Theresa Villiers MP on 11 February 2013 in Dublin we discussed the ongoing, cross-border threat posed by certain groups.</p><p>  In recent months our discussions with the British Government and the Executive, have been taken place against the background of the murder in November 2012 of Prison Officer David Black.  The universal condemnation from across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland and the unified reactions from the two Governments underlined the solidity of the peace process. Public statements made by the Taoiseach, Minister Shatter and by myself reinforced the message of the two Governments standing together in solidarity with Prison Officer Black&rsquo;s family and his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Prison Service. My colleague Minister Shatter attended Mr. Black&rsquo;s funeral.</p><p>  It is worth noting that a number of unsuccessful attempts to injure and kill members of the security forces in Northern Ireland have taken place since the murder of Officer Black and the Government is not complacent about the persistence of the threat.</p><p>  In addition to discussions at political level, strong and deep cooperation exists between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland to counter such individuals and groups. The number of arrests in connection with paramilitary activity made in both jurisdictions continues to be significant. The Garda&iacute; and the PSNI will continue to cooperate very closely to combat such activity on both sides of the border.</p></reply>

I agree with the strong case set out by Prime Minister Cameron in his recent speech on the subject for the importance of the UK's continuing and active membership of the Union.</p><p>  The priority of the government is to build stability, jobs and growth, and we are working as Presidency of the European Union to ensure that these are at the top of the agenda across the work of the Union.  The UK remains a key partner for us in this regard.  With other Member States, we have a shared interest in making sure that the Union is properly equipped to meet the challenges of the future.</p><p>  In the domestic context, continuing to attract foreign direct investment is one of the cornerstones of our economic recovery.  Ireland's status as an attractive location for investment is underpinned by our educated workforce, our position as the only English-speaking country within the Eurozone and, of course, our strong commitment to the European Union.  These factors will continue to attract investment to Ireland into the future.</p><p>  Irish prosperity is also closely linked with deepening and enhancing the economic relationship with the UK, which remains Ireland's largest trading partner.  Trade with the UK is of vital importance to the jobs and livelihoods of a significant proportion of our workforce.  As set out in the joint statement of the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron on the future of British-Irish relations of March 2012, a joint evaluation of the British-Irish economic relationship and this project is now underway, with consultants working to examine the depth of interdependence between the economies and to identify common strategic challenges and opportunities to be addressed.</p></reply>

The joint EU-US High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth, set up following the last EU-US Summit in November 2011, was tasked with identifying policies and measures to further increase EU-US trade and investment including a possible trade and investment agreement to support mutually beneficial job creation, economic growth, and international competitiveness.  That High Level Group issued its Final Report to EU and US Leaders on 12 February 2013.  The Report concluded that a comprehensive agreement that addresses a broad range of bilateral trade and investment issues, including regulatory issues, and contributes to the development of global rules, would provide the most significant mutual benefit of the various options which had been considered.  The Report therefore recommended to Leaders that each side initiate as soon as possible the formal domestic procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement.</p><p>  In a joint statement on 13 February 2013, EU and US Leaders welcomed the Report's recommendations and confirmed that each side will now initiate the internal procedures necessary to launch negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  For its part, the European Commission has indicated that it will move quickly to present a negotiating mandate to EU Member States for approval by the Council of Ministers in order to start negotiations as soon as possible, still during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council.  As Presidency, we will play our full part in achieving this objective.</p></reply>

Overall, and while there have been difficult days and many setbacks along the way, as evident in Syria, the balance-sheet remains positive.  Democratic elections have taken place for the first time in countries such as Libya, Tunisia and Egypt and basic freedoms and foundations of democracy have been advanced in many of the countries undergoing transition.</p><p>  Ireland welcomes the strong commitment expressed in the European Council Conclusions to continue developing Europe's partnership with those countries.  The Conclusions acknowledged  that these processes of transition will inevitably take time and should involve a differentiated approach which reflects the progress individual countries are making in implementing democratic reforms.  Overall, the EU's relations with the Southern Neighbourhood must be clearly based on the promotion and protection of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.</p><p>  The European Council tasked High Representative Ashton and the Foreign Affairs Council to conduct a review   of the effectiveness of the EU's current policies in assisting the political and economic transition of the region and to report back by next June.  In looking at how the effectiveness of the EU's collective action in the region can be enhanced, Ireland considers it important to ensure that the pace of democratic and economic development is country-led and that there is clear ownership in each country of the overall process of transition. </p><p>  We also believe it is important for the EU's reputation in the region and for its overall relations with the Arab world that the Union should show leadership to the extent possible on political issues of strong mutual concern, and in particular in seeking to advance the Middle East peace process.  These are arguments we will advance in the forthcoming review.</p></reply>

Civil society organisations play an important role in bringing citizens together to act collectively and participate in the development of their own countries and communities. They have a strong role to play in demanding better services from the state and holding governments to account.</p><p>  In some developing countries, civil society organisations have come under increasing pressure in recent years as they seek to play their legitimate role in society.  In these countries, dialogue with civil society organisations is limited and the space for civil society engagement remains narrow or is, in some cases, shrinking. This can severely limit the operations and effectiveness of organisations, notably those working on human rights and advocacy.</p><p>  Ireland has a long tradition of supporting civil society engagement.  In fact, Tr&oacute;caire and a number of other organisations, such as, Christian Aid and Frontline Defenders, are specifically funded by my Department to promote and facilitate strong civil society engagement across a range of countries.  In our nine partner countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance, we also provide funding to local civil society organisations.  This enables their participation at local and national levels of decision-making and their work for the fulfilment of human rights, especially for the most vulnerable.  Ireland&#8217;s partnerships in these countries are founded on respect for human rights, and we will continue to use every influence we have with partner governments to ensure that the role of civil society organisations is enhanced.</p><p>  Ireland is also actively engaged at the international level in ensuring that the space for civil society is protected. For example, at the meeting of Development Ministers under the EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Luxembourg in October last, I gave strong support to the new EU Council Conclusions on Europe's engagement with civil society. These commit Member States &#8220;to support and promote an enabling environment for an independent, pluralistic and active civil society in partner countries&#8221;  <i>.  </i></p><p>  Ireland&#8217;s membership of the UN Human Rights Council presents a valuable opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society.  We intend to advance the issue of civil society space during our term on the UN Human Rights Council and to continue championing the UN Universal Periodic Review mechanism which reviews all member states&#8217; human rights records, including the treatment of civil society actors and human rights defenders.</p><p>  The Government will continue to promote civil society-led initiatives and to support other arrangements at national and international level to promote and monitor an enabling environment for civil society organisations.</p></reply>

This relentless process serves to poison relationships between the two peoples and is the exact opposite of what would be done by a government actively pursuing confidence building and reconciliation.   </p><p>  I am seriously concerned by a significant rise in these demolitions in recent weeks. Figures provided by the UN indicate that in January there were 139 demolitions of Palestinian structures including 59 residential structures and 80 animal shelters. The majority of these were in the Jordan valley. This represents a three-fold increase over the monthly average in 2012. These actions forcibly displaced 251 Palestinians, including 153 children, and affected many more. In some cases, troops returned days later to again destroy tents and temporary shelters supplied by aid agencies.</p><p>  The main reason for these demolitions and evictions is to make room for the ongoing expansion of illegal Israeli settlements. In other cases the land is cleared for military use, including training ranges, or even for parks. It is clear that all of these are just variations of an intention to force Palestinians off the land, to leave it in undisputed Israeli control. This occurs principally in Area C, which includes the whole Jordan valley, and in east Jerusalem. Regular destruction of wells, cisterns and other water and power infrastructure has the same objective. The usual pretext for demolition is that the structures lack planning permission. However, the authorities systematically refuse planning permission to Palestinian applicants, while at the same time applying completely different standards and responses to building by Israeli settlers.</p><p>  These policies are clearly in violation of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention.  International law accepts that occupation authorities sometimes may have to demolish buildings, but this is usually in the context of imperative military necessity or indeed actual combat, neither of which would seem to be relevant to these cases. In addition, these actions are carried out in many cases to facilitate the continued expansion of Israeli settlements, which is itself contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p><p>  Ireland has consistently raised concerns about settlements and related issues such as demolitions, especially at EU level. The Foreign Affairs Council in May 2012 adopted detailed Conclusions on many of these issues, including demolitions and forced transfers. EU Missions on the ground are also actively engaged at present in exploring ways of helping the affected communities while our strong concerns and opposition to such practices have repeatedly been relayed to the Israeli authorities, both via our Embassy in Tel Aviv as well as through the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. </p></reply>

I have received a full briefing on the assessment of an Oireachtas delegation that recently visited Maghaberry Prison and can assure the House that we continue to monitor developments there very closely.  My officials are in regular communication with a network of contacts, including public representatives, individuals and organisations working closely with the prisoners themselves.  This facilitates confidential approaches on individual cases of concern.  I wish to underline however, that this is against the background of the devolution of policing and justice in February 2010 and of ongoing and far reaching reform in the justice system in Northern Ireland, led by Minister David Ford.</p><p>  In October 2011 a report into prison reform was published by Dame Anne Owers which made far reaching recommendations related to prison reform in Northern Ireland.  This followed a full review of the prison system with a particular focus on how best to protect the human rights of individual prisoners.  Much progress has been made to date in implementing the recommended reforms contained within this report, including a significant uptake of the prison officers&rsquo; &ldquo;exit&rdquo; scheme and a corresponding recruitment of new prison staff.  Minister Ford confirmed recently that, to date, 287 prison officers have left the service through the voluntary redundancy scheme and he has secured funding to allow a further 73 Prison Officers to leave.  The delivery of a reformed justice system has a major part to play in building and protecting a more positive future for Northern Ireland.

A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared future for the people of Northern Ireland can be based.  I would urge all the parties in the Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.</p><p>  In contact with the British administration, we continue to stress the importance of ensuring that a Bill of Rights, for Northern Ireland which takes account of the separate and specific context of Northern Ireland.

My most recent meeting with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers MP was here in Dublin on Monday 11 February.  We agreed to continue working together to support the parties in Northern Ireland in addressing both the underlying and immediate causes of the deplorable violence seen in recent months on the streets of Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland.  While the situation has been calmer in recent weeks, we remain fully engaged as Governments in our support of the work of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and are united in our view, in the context of forthcoming parades, that the Parades Commission&rsquo;s determinations must be respected.  Dialogue between parade participants and resident communities continues to be the most effective way to prevent outbreaks of violence.</p><p>  On 17 January 2013, together with the Secretary of State and her colleague Minister of State Mike Penning MP, I met with First Minister Peter Robinson MLA and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness MLA.  At that meeting, we reviewed the situation following the recent flags controversy across the three dimensions of public order, political leadership and rebuilding Northern Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  We emphasised the need for protests to stop as well as our support for the PSNI who have been at the frontline in dealing with the violent incidents unfortunately associated with some of the protests.  The Secretary of State and I encouraged the First Minister and deputy First Minister to work with other Party Leaders in Northern Ireland to move on from the current controversy towards building a shared, cohesive and integrated society.  We also offered to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the good work done by the Executive and others on attracting inward investment and tourists to Northern Ireland is not put at risk.</p><p>  The persistence of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, with the absence of political agreement on how to make progress towards a truly reconciled society, contributes to the likelihood of incidents such as those we have witnessed in recent weeks.  This crisis will not be resolved other than by a cross-party, cross-community response.  In my view therefore, there is no substitute for the party leaders agreeing on a framework for talks to address the issues that have arisen in relation to flags and symbols.  These are political issues that require a political solution.  The sooner the framework is agreed the better.  In the meantime, there has been very welcome progress in securing practical support for ongoing programmes to address sectarianism in Northern Ireland, in particular the agreement on a new EU Peace Programme (PEACE IV) with funding of &euro;150m secured.</p><p>  Looking forward, the focus of political leadership in Northern Ireland should be on maintaining and creating jobs through economic recovery, in which inward investment and tourism play such a crucial role.  The Government are ready to support the Executive and political leadership in Northern Ireland in whatever way we can.</p></reply>

In particular we manage the response to requests for participation in UN and EU humanitarian missions through the Rapid Response Corps as well as requests for participation in civilian crisis management missions overseen by the EU&rsquo;s External Action Service and election monitoring missions overseen by the Organisation for Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  We also coordinate responses to requests from other bodies as they arise.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps is made up of highly-skilled people who can be deployed at short notice to assist in emergency relief efforts.  Calls for applicants are published annually on my Department&rsquo;s Irish Aid website and recruitment is undertaken through a competitive interview process.  Roster Members are required to hold an appropriate technical qualification and possess substantial relevant professional experience, preferably in a humanitarian context, demonstrate a commitment to humanitarian values, and be in a position to deploy at short notice for periods of 3 to 6 months.  Induction training for roster members is mandatory and is delivered in partnership with the Irish Defence Forces.  The selection of roster members for deployment is undertaken by the UN agencies by matching skills, experience and competencies with the vacancy.  When an Irish roster member is selected by the UN Partner, Irish Aid makes all the necessary preparatory arrangements (visa, travel, insurance and medical).  Members of the Irish Aid rosters have deployed on 188 occasions to 42 countries.  There are currently 11 members of the Irish Aid roster on deployment with the United Nations in 8 countries, Egypt, Kenya, Lebanon, Myanmar, the Philippines, Senegal, Somalia and South Sudan.</p><p>  The European External Action Service (EEAS) issues periodic &ldquo;calls for contributions&rdquo; requesting Member States to nominate persons to fill vacancies in civilian crisis management missions established under the Common Security and Defence Policy.  My Department maintains a list of persons who have asked to be considered for such missions, and also advertises positions of interest to Ireland through the Public Jobs website.  My Department nominates applicants to the EEAS only where it considers that their qualifications and experience satisfy the requirements for the position, as set out in the call for contributions.  The final selection of candidates is made by the EEAS from among those nominated by the member states.  Member states bear a significant proportion of the cost of seconding their experts to missions.  In light of the limited financial resources available, my Department deployed ten seconded experts in 2012.  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the deployment of members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to these Missions.</p><p>  The Government believes that international election monitoring missions have an important role to play in the promotion of human rights and democracy, and my Department maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions.  We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.</p><p>  There are currently some 300 people on the Department&rsquo;s Election Observation Roster.  A call for applications to participate in the roster was recently published on my Department&rsquo;s Irish Aid website, with a closing date of 18 February.  The main requirement for inclusion on the roster is experience in the administration of elections (domestic or overseas).  Candidates who fulfil the requirements are placed on the roster following an interview.  The election observation programme is subject to continuous monitoring to ensure that it operates efficiently, and is currently under review.  It is expected that a new roster will be in place mid-year 2013.</p><p>  When a request for electoral observation is received from the EU and OSCE, the Department seeks expressions of interest from all observers on the election roster.  From the expressions of interest, a list of suitably qualified observers is then drawn up, taking into account the length of time since their last mission as well as any specific criteria for the mission, including country and regional experience and relevant language proficiency, if applicable.  Attention is also given to contributing to the commitment by the EU and OSCE to achieving a better gender balance on missions, as well as the need for Ireland to increase the number of experienced observers on our roster.</p></reply>

The Ambassador and officers in the Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited to Sri Lanka, and the Honorary Consul of Ireland Office in Colombo have also been very active in this difficult case.  The person named by the Deputy has been detained in Sri Lanka since 5 September 2007.  No charge was brought against him until 29 January 2013.  I am informed that at his trial on that date a sentence of one month was imposed on him. Subsequently, he was informed that he would be released on Tuesday, 12 February 2013. Based on this information his family made flight arrangements for him to return to Ireland.  Officials from the Honorary Consulate attended the prison on 12 February to be present on his release and to offer any possible consular assistance.  They were informed that the release would not go ahead and that four charges would be brought against him.</p><p>  I am personally very concerned about this latest development and especially by the sudden manner by which his release was revoked.  I have written to the Minister for External Affairs expressing in the strongest possible terms my disappointment and concern at the latest developments in this case and asking that the Minister act to ensure that all possible due process of law is afforded to the person named by the Deputy.  Arrangements have been made for our Ambassador in New Delhi to travel to Sri Lanka today, Wednesday, 20 February in order that he may pay a prison visit to him.  The Ambassador also requested a meeting with the Sri Lankan Minister for External Affairs and he will personally deliver my letter to the Minister.</p><p>  My Department will continue to take every opportunity to seek to discuss this case bilaterally with the Sri Lankan authorities and at international fora.  I can assure the Deputy that all possible consular assistance will continue to be provided in this very difficult case and that my officials will continue to liaise with the family of the person named by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that there was widespread revulsion at the attempted murder of Malala Yousafzai last October.  The shooting was condemned by the High Representative/Vice President of the European Commission, Catherine Ashton, and the Secretary General of the Nations, Ban Ki-Moon.  I too expressed and continue to express my utter condemnation of this appalling act.  Like many others, I admire Malala Yousafzai&rsquo;s courageous efforts to promote the fundamental right to education and her efforts to achieve education for women and girls in Pakistan and other regions worldwide.</p><p>  During Pakistan&rsquo;s most recent UN Universal Periodic Review in October 2012, Ireland urged the Government of Pakistan to give consideration to adopting measures to protect individual and minority rights in line with its Constitution and with international human rights standards and conventions.  We also recommended that the Government of Pakistan invite the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders to conduct an independent visit to Pakistan.</p><p>  The EU engages in regular dialogue with Pakistan on human rights and democratic principles, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  The EU has called on the Pakistani authorities, at the highest level, to adopt measures to protect individual and minority rights in line with the Constitution and with international human rights standards and conventions.  In particular, High Representative Ashton, met Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar in December 2012 to discuss a range of issues, including an exchange on the case of Malala Yousafzai.</p><p>  The Government of Pakistan has confirmed to my Department that the views espoused by Malala Yousafzai, in the words of Pakistan&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, represent Pakistan&rsquo;s future and Pakistan&rsquo;s hope.  The President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari and his daughter, during a visit to Britain recently, visited Malala Yousfazai in hospital in Birmingham, while undergoing treatment for and recuperating from her injuries.  I am also informed that Malala Yousafzai is applauded and supported by all political parties in Pakistan.</p><p>  The Government of Pakistan, to underline its support for the views espoused by Malala Yousafzai has, I understand, appointed her father as Education Attach&eacute; at the Pakistani Consulate in Birmingham, and that by these acts there is a clear message of Pakistani Government support for equal access to education for boys and girls.</p></reply>

We see it as a vital tool for promoting reform, democracy and stability in Europe, and we are working to facilitate and advance the process for all candidates and prospective candidates.</p><p>  At the December 2012 General Affairs Council there was substantive discussion on enlargement, and the European Council Conclusions of 14 December 2012 allow for further discussions at Council on the enlargement agenda during our Presidency.  The Conclusions reaffirmed the EU perspective of the countries of the Western Balkans.  Notably, they invited the Commission and EEAS to report back to Council later this year on progress on reforms in Macedonia, Serbia, Albania and Kosovo, with a view to the Council possibly taking decisions on the opening of accession negotiations with Macedonia and Serbia, granting of candidate status to Albania, and the opening of Stability and Association Agreement negotiations with Kosovo.</p><p>  In addition to working to facilitate such decisions at Council if the Commission and EEAS report positively, the Irish Presidency will continue to pursue other priorities on the enlargement agenda, including overseeing the final monitoring report on Croatia, progressing negotiations with Iceland and Montenegro, and working to reinvigorate Turkey&rsquo;s accession process.  The EU also continues to encourage Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement the necessary reforms to enable it to progress on its EU path. </p><p>  The proposed Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 includes provision for IPA II, the Instrument of Pre-Accession Assistance.

The total value of merchandise exports in 2012 was &euro;92 billion, representing an increase of 3.1% on the 2010 figure (&euro;89 billion), while services exports for the first nine months of 2012 reached &euro;66 billion; an increase of 23% on the same period in 2010 (&euro;54 billion).  In terms of our merchandise trade with Europe, over the past two years, exports have increased by 3% with notable growth in exports to Switzerland (37%), Germany (20%), Poland (11%), Great Britain (7.4%), Netherlands (7%) and Belgium (3%).  Outside of European markets, there was significant growth in merchandise exports to, inter alia, Canada (24%), Russia (20%), India (15%) and Japan (20%).</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government Trade Strategy identifies 27 priority markets, including those with the best prospects for increased trade.

I would, however, hope to see it continue to play a full and active part into the future and this is something which I and my Ministerial colleagues continue to communicate in our contacts with the British government.  Like all Member States, the UK gains from its membership of the European Union, not least through unfettered access to a Single Market of more than 500 million people.  At the same time, the UK also makes a valued contribution to our Union of 27 &ndash; soon to be 28 &ndash; Member States.  The EU is stronger for having the UK as a Member State.  From a national perspective, having the ability to work together within the Union on the many issues on which we are of like mind - the single market and trade liberalisation to name just two &ndash; amplifies the impact of our excellent relationship generally. </p><p>  British-Irish relations are at a stage of maturity, friendship and mutual cooperation unparalleled in our history but it is important that the very settled nature of the relationship is not taken for granted.  We continue to engage with our British counterparts at all levels across a range of areas of importance both here and in the UK.  These areas are identified in identified in the joint statement on the future of the British-Irish relationship issued by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron in March 2012, and include continued cooperation on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, addressing global issues such as climate change, poverty and hunger, and working closely together as partners within the European Union.  We also closely monitor all political developments within the UK on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  A key priority for us is, of course, to deepen the economic relationship between our countries, for the benefit of all our citizens.  The UK is Ireland&rsquo;s largest trading partner and that trade underpins the jobs and livelihoods of a significant proportion of our workforce.  The total value of merchandise exports to the UK last year was &euro;15.2 billion.  This represents a 6.8% increase on exports in 2011. </p><p>  The Embassy of Ireland in London and our Consulate General in Edinburgh work very closely with the State business development agencies, all of whom have representation in the British market.  All are fully committed to supporting Irish business in the UK.

This year, as with previous years, it is the intention of the Government to maximise all opportunities generated by Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day, including the traditional programme of ministerial travel, to promote our national image and our trade and commercial interests.  Our Embassy network will prepare targeted programmes focused on promoting Ireland&#8217;s trade, tourism and investment objectives for travelling Ministers, making the most of their presence to raise the profile and coverage of events and secure high-level access.  Examples of events that Ministers will engage in include meetings related to trade, tourism and investment opportunities, media interviews, networking events, and bilateral meetings with national, regional and local Ministers, along with other high profile events such as <i>Greening </i>ceremonies.</p><p>  The promotional efforts of my Department will, of course, not be limited to the small number of countries that receive ministerial visits; our entire Embassy network across 58 countries will work hard to ensure that Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day celebrations are utilised fully in support of our economic and reputational interests.  </p><p>  The Trade and Promotion Division of my Department will develop a set of key messages tailored to Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day, in cooperation with the relevant state agencies, which will be circulated widely and which our Embassy network and travelling Ministers will be able to draw on to spread a positive message about Ireland&#8217;s recovery and future prospects. </p></reply>

St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day provides an invaluable opportunity to engage directly with Irish communities around the world.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day provides an invaluable opportunity to further deepen this interaction.  Each Ministerial programme during the period will include substantive Irish diaspora elements across all sectors including elderly Irish, recent emigrants, Irish business networks and cultural groups.  In addition to the Ministerial Programmes, each of our Missions undertakes extensive Irish community programmes during the March period.</p><p>  Building a strategic relationship between Ireland and its diaspora is a core priority for my Department.  Since 2008, the Emigrant Support Programme has provided grants of &euro;66 million to our people abroad, particularly our most vulnerable Irish emigrants.  The Government has also intensified its engagement with the business community through the Global Irish Network.  A decision has recently been taken to convene a third Global Irish Economic Forum in October of this year.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish immigrants will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  </p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as his subsequent speech on the issue on 29 January and his State of the Union address on 12 February sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress continue with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.  I am currently engaged in a round of telephone discussions with key US Senators and in this context I spoke with Senator John McCain on 8 February last to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation for the efforts he and others are making in developing bi-partisan Senate proposals and to underline our ongoing interest in the issue.  The Taoiseach discussed immigration reform when he spoke with President Obama to congratulate him on his re-election.  The issue will remain a central feature of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the US authorities, including over the forthcoming St Patrick&rsquo;s day period.  My programme, and that of other members of the Government during that period, while not yet finalised, will include meetings with key political figures and the Irish community groups that provide assistance to the undocumented. </p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

In our foreign policy, which is expressed in direct contact with other countries or multilaterally through the EU, the UN, and other international bodies such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, we are working to alleviate instances of war, starvation, famine, and human rights abuses, including the denial of women&rsquo;s rights, and to enhance international peace and security.</p><p>  With our EU partners, we monitor closely the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question. We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015. We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses. This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States every four years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned. Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings. In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training). Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported. Irish Aid, the aid programme operated by my Department, has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</p><p>  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

On the issue of due process, the Conclusions adopted by EU Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council last December called on Ukraine to demonstrate &lsquo;determined action and tangible progress&rsquo; in three areas of concern, including that of selective justice.   On the question of access, Ms Tymoshenko has, I understand, been visited recently by her lawyer. She also met with the European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission to Ukraine, led by the former President of Poland, Mr Aleksander Kwa&oelig;niewski, and the former President of the European Parliament, Mr Pat Cox, earlier this month.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the following information on the proposed exemptions is subject to enactment of the Bill.    </p><p>  Residential properties owned by a charity and used solely as residential accommodation in the course of facilitating recreational activities connected with its charitable purpose will be exempt from LPT.  An example would be a residential property that is used to accommodate girl guides or boy scouts who take part in guiding and scouting activities.  The charity must have been granted an exemption for tax purposes by Revenue to avail of the exemption. </p><p>  An exemption will also apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court or where a trust has been established specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence. </p><p>  Residential properties that have been certified as having significant pyritic damage will be exempt from LPT for a temporary period of approximately three years.  Regulations will be made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government stipulating how properties are to be tested to establish whether they have been affected by a significant level of pyrite-induced damage and providing for the issue of certificates by a competent person where this has been established. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that once a certificate has been issued, an exemption may be claimed in respect of 3 consecutive liability dates.  For example, where a certificate has been issued on or before 1 May 2013 the exemption will last until the end of 2015.  If a certificate has not been issued before the first and/or second liability dates of 1 May 2013 and 1 November 2013, respectively, a liable person will have the option, where the certificate is issued on or before 31 December 2013, to retrospectively claim that one or other of those dates be the first liability date of the 3 consecutive liability dates.  If such a claim is made on or before 31 January 2014, any local property tax that has already been paid in respect of one or both of those liability dates (depending on which date is selected) will then be refunded by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

A range of foreign languages are available on the curriculum in second level schools &ndash; French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic &ndash; and the school system is producing a large supply of students who have studied foreign languages. Every year, over 30,000 students sit a European language for the Leaving Certificate, including around 26,000 in French, 6,700 in German and 4,000 in Spanish, with smaller numbers taking other languages. The availability of Transition Year and the option of school developed short courses proposed as part of junior cycle reform will provide opportunities for schools to provide additional languages, if they so choose.</p><p>  Prospective students then have access to a wide range of further and higher education courses with a foreign language as either a core subject or in combination with a range of other disciplines. In addition, a number of foreign language programmes have been selected for funding through the Springboard initiative, which provides free part time higher places targeted at unemployed people in areas of identified skills needs. Employer input and research by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs informed the development and selection of these Springboard programmes.</p><p>  Almost 12% of our post-primary students, as well as our general population, are of nationalities other than Irish. Many would have a mother tongue that is not English. These individuals also represent a potential valuable local resource for employers to draw upon.  Leaving Certificate examinations are offered in a number of other non-curricular EU languages to students who meet certain criteria including that they speak the language as a mother tongue. Some 1,500 students took 16 additional languages in 2012.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome who have care needs may also receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children, rather than solely by reference to a pupil's disability categorisation.</p><p>  I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability. This advice will be included in the NCSE&rsquo;s comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected in the coming months.</p><p>  All schools have been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching or SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March 2013 and schools will then be notified by Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) of their resource teaching allocation for 2013/14, based on the number of valid applications received.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The number of PLC teaching posts will be reduced by 200 and this may lead to some reduction in subject choices for learners.  </p><p>  In the meantime PLC providers will have an opportunity to plan for the reduced allocation to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both learners and employers. In doing so it is expected that they will have regard to the full range of factors relevant to PLC provision while minimising impact on learners. This would include consideration of factors such as the relevance of courses to the labour market, numbers undertaking courses, completion rates, certification rates and progression rates as well as the capacity for amalgamation of courses or modular delivery, etc.  Until this process has been finalised it is not possible to advise the Deputy  of the impact of this change.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  In relation to the availability of school places in the specific schools referred to by the Deputy, my Department has no applications on hands from any of the schools concerned for additional accommodation to address any immediate accommodation needs.  Should a school need such additional accommodation it is open to the school authority to apply for same by completing the application form which can be downloaded from the Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p></reply>

The Government is determined that all young people will leave school able to read, communicate orally, in writing and in digital media, and be able to understand and use mathematics in their everyday lives and in further learning.  The Literacy and Numeracy Strategy which was launched in July 2011 adopts a modern and comprehensive definition of literacy which includes digital literacy.  The strategy sets out a range of improvement targets for literacy and numeracy including digital literacy.  The new Junior Cycle which is to be implemented in schools on a phased basis from 2014.  Eight skills underpin the learning which is to take place at Junior Cycle.  Among the key skills, are literacy and numeracy, including digital literacy and each of the key skills has elements which relate to digital literacy.  These will be embedded in all of the new subject and short course specifications developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for the new Junior Cycle.  In addition, the new Junior Cycle Framework also provides for short courses designed for approximately 100 hours of student engagement over two or three years and specified at a common level across the entire junior cycle.</p><p>  The NCCA is currently working on short courses in relation to digital literacy and programming and coding.  These will be available to schools from 2014.  ICT (including ICT infrastructure) is an important tool in the development of digital skills. ICT provides teachers with more up to date, exciting and relevant ways of presenting and engaging with the curriculum. One of the most important ICT infrastructure developments is the provision of 100mbps to post primary schools.  The availability of high speed broadband opens up endless possibilities for the use of ICT in the classroom.  In addition to the availability of infrastructure, teachers must be proficient in the use of ICT in teaching and learning and curriculum relevant digital content must be available for use by those teachers.</p><p>  There are a numerous specific examples of how ICT can be used to enhance the teaching of literacy skills.  One particular project where ICT is used as an incentive to improve literacy levels among school children is the FIS Bookclub.  The Bookclub is an online network designed to facilitate peer-to-peer book reviews for primary school pupils.  The network allows pupils to upload video reviews of their own choice of books, for the benefit of other members.  Technologies such as visualiser, interactive whiteboards and more increasingly individual student devices are being used in the classroom.  These technologies in particular can be used across a range of literacy activities at primary and post primary level.  For both primary and post primary level, Scoilnet, the national portal for digital content in Irish Education provides a central resource to teachers, pupils and parents, offering access to a growing repository of advice and information.  There are over 12,000 specific resources relating to the curriculum available.</p><p>  The education system has a key role to play in fostering and developing the digital literacy and ICT skills necessary for the competitive employment market.  In view of the importance of digital literacy skills in relation to employment opportunities my Department is actively pursuing a programme of work to ensure our young people leave school with the skills necessary.  In addition, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan which I launched last year outlines a range of short, medium and long term measures to increase the domestic supply of high level ICT graduates from the education system.</p></reply>

The intention behind this approach is to ensure that, at a time of reduced resources, the Government targets valuable schemes, such as the student grant scheme, at those who need them most.  Equally, it is to ensure that those who can afford to pay to go to higher education should do so.

The benefits arising from these central arrangements include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and compliance with EU procurement regulations; and enhanced service levels.  The NPS is constantly carrying out research into any number of different markets where it is felt savings for the taxpayer can be made.  One such area of spend under review at the moment is the supply of art and graphic supplies for schools.  When this research is complete a decision will be made if the level of spend and potential savings warrant the NPS running a national competition for such supplies.  The NPS also has, as part of its education and development remit, an active programme to educate SMEs in how to participate effectively in the public service procurement process.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,500 SMEs nationwide.  In NPS competitions, the tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs.  A prime example of this is when the NPS decided to divide the office supplies contract into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper.  This was to increase the possibility for SMEs to tender individually, or form consortia that could enter competitive bids to win this national contract.  Codex Ltd, an indigenous company, won the Stationery contract and are sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers.  Furthermore, the ICT Consumables contract was also won by another Irish SME, Datapac Limited.</p></reply>

The budget has now to be agreed with the European Parliament.  In line with reductions to the overall EU budget, Cohesion funding across Europe is expected to be reduced from &euro;347 billion to around &euro;325 billion.  Nevertheless, while the precise details remain to be worked out, it is expected that Ireland&rsquo;s overall Structural Funds allocation will actually increase from the &euro;901 billion we receive under the current round.  This represents a considerable achievement and is due to the consistent efforts of the Government to maximize support from Europe for our Structural Funds programmes.  In the case of the Border, Midlands and Western Region however, is likely that the allocation it receives will be reduced.  This is because the region will no longer qualify as a transition region since its GDP per capita exceeds 90% of the EU average.  Nevertheless, the Government was successful in securing a special allocation of &euro;100 million for the BMW Region to mitigate the effects of its change in status and in recognition of the significant economic downturn that the region has experienced.  The European Council also agreed a special Youth Employment Initiative using &euro;6 billion of Structural Funds for regions with levels of youth unemployment above 25%, from which it is expected the BMW Region will benefit.  The focus on youth unemployment is something the Irish Government had been pressing for.</p></reply>

It is intended that the competition will involve an upfront payment by the operator of the next licence to the State, a portion of which will be used to help build the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is envisaged that the competition will commence later this year.  A National Lottery Bill was published in December 2012 and is currently before the D&aacute;il.  The proposal to provide for a special weekly National Lottery draw, the proceeds of which would be set aside to help fund the building of the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, was one of a number of issues raised in a private members' motion which was debated in the Seanad on 13 February 2013.  Central to the success of the National Lottery since its establishment in 1986 has been the provision of ongoing Lottery funding for good causes.  They are categorized as follows in section 5 of the National Lottery Act 1986:</p><p>- sport and other recreation</p><p>- national culture (including the Irish language)</p><p>- the arts</p><p>- the health of the community</p><p>- youth</p><p>- welfare</p><p>- national heritage</p><p>- amenities</p><p>  It is intended that the next licence will continue to provide for the ongoing provision of a significant level of funding for good causes each year.  The National Lottery Bill provides that the categories of good causes will remain as they are at present.  While the motivation for the proposal referred to in the Question is well-intentioned, it is likely that such a draw would simply see players switching their usual spend on lottery products to one that would be dedicated to assist funding the Hospital.  In addition, there would be uncertainty around the scale and timing of likely revenues that would emerge.  Essentially, the provision for a special National Lottery draw to raise funds for the building of the new Hospital would result in less funding for the existing categories of good causes.  Consequently, less money would be available for the type of local and community-based projects which are so closely associated with the success of the National Lottery over the years.</p><p>  The decision to provide for an upfront payment under the next licence was made after careful consideration of the various options.  Unlike the proposal to provide for a special draw, the Government&rsquo;s approach will ensure that the raising of funds to allow the State to proceed with the building of the Hospital will not be at the expense of good causes.  The Government is seeking to maximise the benefit of the Irish National Lottery Licence so that maximum benefits can accrue to Irish citizens both through a sizeable upfront payment that can help fund the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital and through strong growth in revenue for good causes.</p></reply>

This is achieved by providing a statutory schedule of payments, prohibiting the use of &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; clauses in construction contracts and, most importantly, it provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights; by suspending their labour and the provision of statutory adjudication.  Given these provisions the requirement for security of payment reduces since the exposure of a subcontractor to non-payment is greatly reduced.</p><p>  A range of security of payment options, including Project Bank Accounts were considered in the initial drafts of the Construction Contracts Bill and provision was made for devices such as bonds as part of the first draft of the Bill that was introduced to the Seanad by Senator Feargal Quinn.

This is an in-depth examination of the flood risk in the Shannon catchment and a detailed plan with specific recommendations on measures to manage that risk will be produced by Jacobs.</p><p>  In advance of the detailed analysis which is being carried out under the Shannon CFRAM Study Jacobs was requested by OPW to prioritise a formal review of the operating regulations and procedures of the control structures along the river Shannon with the purpose of identifying potential improvements with respect to flood risk management that could be introduced in the short term.</p><p>  That report and a non-technical summary of the Report - &lsquo;Understanding Water levels on the River Shannon&rsquo; was circulated to all public representatives in the region, last Autumn.   In addition, a direct briefing on the report was made by Jacobs Engineering in late 2012 to the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association  and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</p><p>  Arising from those consultations, it was agreed, to explore the possibility of carrying out a water level monitoring exercise, involving controlled raising and lowering of weir boards at selected locations, subject to favourable hydrological conditions.</p><p>  It is important to note that operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is a matter for both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  The OPW met with both organisations recently to review the scheduling of such an exercise having regard to existing water management protocols operated by these two bodies for the major storage areas in the Shannon system.  It has been agreed to involve the expertise of Jacobs Engineering, in order to advance the water monitoring proposal.</p><p>  In addition it is open to all local authorities within the Shannon catchment to apply to the OPW for funds under the Minor Works Scheme in respect of any proposals to carry out local flood alleviation works which might be in general accord with the approach of the Shannon CFRAM Study.</p></reply>

I intend to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the Consumer and Competition Bill. This Bill will also, <i>inter alia</i>  , merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, update and reform competition law on foot of a review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002 and give effect to the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers, Work on drafting the Consumer and Competition Bill is on-going and the Bill is included in the &#8220;A list&#8221; in the Government&#8217;s current Legislative Programme.</p><p>  It is important to point out that in introducing a statutory Code the intention is not to protect one stakeholder over another nor is the Code intended to prevent stakeholders such as retailers and suppliers from engaging in robust contractual negotiations as happens in most other sectors of the economy. It is also the case that the Code is not seeking in any way to determine the price of grocery goods. Rather the essential value of the Code is that by regulating problematic practices in the grocery goods sector it seeks to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the various stakeholders including the interests of the end user, the consumer.</p><p>  The Government is strongly of the view that it is important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have robust agri-food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy. The introduction of a Code of Practice is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p></reply>

It is unwise to concentrate solely on one single set of statistics and a comprehensive view of the sector requires an assessment of all relevant indicators, especially over a longer period, as erratic fluctuations can occur from time to time.</p><p>  The key data source for Industrial Production is the monthly Central Statistics Office publication on <i>Industrial Production and Turnover</i>  . The most recent release, published earlier this month, covers the period up to December 2012 so we now have full 2012 data. This latest information shows that production increased by 11% in December last over the previous month (seasonally adjusted basis) and this helped overcome a poor performance during some earlier months of 2012. The index of Industrial production now stands 2.8% higher than its level at the end of 2011, which represents a very solid recovery.</p><p>  In relation to <i>Purchases,</i> the reputable NCB Purchasing Managers Index is a composite indicator designed to provide an overall view of activity in the manufacturing sector of the Irish Economy and also acts as a leading indicator for the whole economy. After a period of contraction between November 2011 and February 2012, this Index has recorded 11 straight months of consecutive growth from March 2012 to January 2013. The Index now stands at about 50% higher than its low point in early 2009.</p><p>  Regarding <i>export</i> performance, the picture is also positive. It is heartening that exports of manufactured goods are continuing to rise despite challenges in many of our key markets. Final 2012 export data published by the Central Statistics Office just last week showed that goods exports increased by 1% over 2011, reaching a total of &#8364;92bn, the highest figure since 2002.</p><p>  Employment in the sector had suffered a major shock in 2008-2010 when approximately 50,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing.  However, numbers have stabilised over the last two years and there are now 205,700 people directly employed in manufacturing (both full-time and part-time), and a similar number of people are employed indirectly.</p><p>  To promote job opportunities in this sector, the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 included several specific initiatives to develop the sector. The Manufacturing Development Forum, which I established last year, has facilitated this process.  I asked Forfas to develop a new Strategy for Manufacturing up to 2020 and this study is currently being finalised.  A new report on the Skills needs of the sector, also being finalised at present, will also be a key driver in pursing those specific needs. </p><p>  A number of steps have already been taken to enable indigenous manufacturing firms to specialise, develop skills and value and scale up including:</p><p>- The launch of the new Potential Exporters Division in Enterprise Ireland, to support more indigenous companies to trade in foreign markets,</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s Lean Business Offer enables manufacturing clients increase productivity and competitiveness,</p><p>- The Launch of a new Development Capital Scheme, aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth, indigenous companies,</p><p>- Improvements to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme.</p><p>  On wider Government actions, we have been systematically identifying those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 included an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to improve competitiveness and support job creation across all sectors of the economy, including the industrial and manufacturing sector. Further measures to improve our competitiveness will be contained in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which I am currently finalising on behalf of the Government and which will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>  All these initiatives will help build a solid future for manufacturing in Ireland so that we are well positioned to respond to an upturn in global markets.</p></reply>

Our overarching strategy is to accelerate the economic and societal returns from our investment in research and innovation and we are putting in place a range of initiatives to deliver on this strategy.</p><p>  A key cross-Government initiative is implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group which seeks to maximise the impact of our spend by focussing the majority of public competitive research funding on 14 priority areas. The priority areas were identified on the basis of existing strengths of the public research base and the enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact. In February 2012 the Government agreed to implement the recommendations of this report as a whole of Government policy goal and the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG) was established, under the chairmanship and political leadership of the Minister for Research and Innovation, tasked with driving implementation. The PAG comprises representatives of all relevant Government Departments and State Agencies funding research.</p><p>  Key to delivering on implementation is collaboration across the funding Agencies and Departments, and the PAG, which has held 8 plenary meetings since its inception, is the opportune forum for dialogue which can facilitate this collaboration.  Action plans for each of the priority areas are being developed, and represent the detailed blueprint for actions to be taken by funding Departments and Agencies in order to re-align the majority of competitive public research funding around the priority areas.  This new approach is driving new behaviours resulting in a more holistic approach to funding research across relevant Departments and funding Agencies.</p></reply>

According to the Census, there were just under 10,000 young persons (aged 15-24) in the Tallaght area in 2011, which represents just under 14% of the total population. There were 2,178 persons under 25 on the Live Register in Tallaght in January 2013, down 7% on the same month last year. </p><p>  Young people, typically, suffer disproportionately from job losses in recessions as they tend to have entered employment more recently, are more likely to hold temporary contracts and to be employed in cyclically sensitive industries than older workers.</p><p>  In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation. These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies. These initiatives are being rolled out in all areas across the country including Tallaght. Details of these initiatives have already been outlined in earlier PQs relating to youth unemployment policies at the national level. </p><p>  There are some programmes specific to Tallaght that are also being run.

SPT will cease to be paid from 2014 which will standardise the payment of pension at age 66.  In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2012 and to 68 years from 2028.  The State pension (transition) (SPT) is paid for a maximum of 12 months and is available to people who retire from work on reaching age 65 provided they satisfy the necessary PRSI contributions criteria and that they do not work for that one year between age 65 and 66. </p><p>  Figures indicate the numbers applying for SPT from employment are low.  In 2011, 12,052 SPTs were awarded.  The total number of SPT recipients in 2011 was 12,110.   This compares to 296,995 recipients of SPC in 2011.  Of the SPTs awarded in 2011, 1,478 (12.3%) were awarded SPT directly from employment while almost half, 5,850 (48.5%) were already in receipt of another social welfare payment.  A person who retires from work on reaching age 65 and who does not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for SPT may apply for  another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.</p><p>  Raising State pension age and the abolition of SPT is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future and to address the challenges of changing demographics such as increasing life expectancy.   It is important that those who need to or wish to continue in employment after State pension age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.  Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and it can also be beneficial to the individual.</p></reply>

These controls are designed to try to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.</p><p>  First, the  Standard Agreement signed and agreed to by both the intern and the host organisation upon commencement clearly states the terms of the internship; including the expected working hours, which can range from 30 &#8211; 40 hours (maximum) per week and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship.  Second, to ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection is involved in the ongoing monitoring of internships. This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the Internship. Of the 1,235 monitoring visits conducted to date, encouragingly 97% of visits were of a satisfactory nature with remedial action taken in the remaining 3% of cases.  Third, each host organisation&#8217;s allocation of Interns is based on it&#8217;s total number of employees. More details on this and the other stringent Host Organisation criteria are available on   .  Finally, under the current guidelines upon the conclusion of an internship position a cooling off period of 6 months must elapse before a host organisation can re-advertise either this position or another placement in the same area of activity.</p><p>  Any individual, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&#8217;s criteria, including cases of suspected displacement, quality issues or lack of appropriate mentoring and support, may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are fully investigated.  Recent independent research undertaken as part of an external evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon Independent Economic Consultants indicates that displacement of existing paid jobs occurs in only a very small number of cases and accounted for just 3% of the overall number of placements.  Some 40 cases of suspected displacement have been investigated by the Department since July 2011. Following investigation, it was found that these allegations were substantiated in 4 cases and those organisations were disqualified from participating in JobBridge. Of the 2 cases of alleged displacement investigated in Co. Kerry neither could be substantiated.</p><p>  If the individual to whom the Deputy refers is aware of a specific instance of displacement, I would invite her to contact the JobBridge team directly <i>via</i> the &#8216;Contact Us&#8217; section of the JobBridge website (  ) to provide specific details and enable an investigation to be made.</p></reply>

The RBS was launched in 2011 and aimed to make a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to almost all applicants who agreed to engage with them, including 30 applicants from County Clare.</p><p>  In terms of the Government&rsquo;s initiative to bring high speed broadband connectivity to all second-level schools, I am pleased to advise you that St Joseph&rsquo;s Community College in Kilkee received connectivity last year under the national rollout of 100Mbps to secondary schools programme.</p><p>  The Government, through the National Broadband Plan, which I published on 30th August last year, has recognised that the key imperative now is to ensure high speed broadband availability to all.  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020.</p><p>  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.</p><p>  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Kilkee in County Clare, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

The purpose of this USO is to ensure that all citizens can access basic telecommunications services at fixed locations at reasonable prices.  The USO in the telecommunications market is provided for in both EU legislative acts, Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC and national legislation, the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and User&rsquo;s Rights) Regulations 2011 &ndash; S.I. No.337 of 2011.</p><p>  The current USO requires that at least one service provider is designated to provide telecommunications access at fixed locations, access to telephone directories, reasonable access to payphones and specific measures for people with disabilities all at reasonable access prices by regulating connection fees and line rental charges.</p><p>  The national legislation authorises the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) to designate one or more service providers to perform the USO.  In June 2012 ComReg extended, until June 2014, a universal service obligation addressed to Eircom, which among other things, requires that line rental for basic fixed line telephone services is available to end users at a standard price across the country.  There is therefore no line rental price differentiation between urban and rural areas and nor is there is any proposal to amend this obligation at this time.</p></reply>

The regulations I introduced in early 2012 under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, 2010 stipulate that all dogs held in such establishments be microchipped once they reach 8 weeks of age or when a dog is moved from the establishment.  This initiative will result in more and more dogs being microchipped over time.  In addition, many dogs that are seized by dog wardens are microchipped prior to being given to new owners.</p><p>  To be properly effective, the compulsory microchipping of dogs should be supported by the development of a central registration system for all dogs.  It would also be necessary to have the co-operation of the dog-owning public in updating a central registration system where the ownership of a dog changes.  These large projects will be kept under review as they would involve a significant investment in terms of time and funding.</p></reply>

My Department will remain responsible for the overall policy and funding of the non-public water sector, including the group water sector. Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with drinking water standards. This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between the Department, the local authorities and the group water sector itself, with the important involvement of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.<i> This co-operative approach will be maintained as the reform of water services provision is progressed.</i></p></reply>

These targeted patrols and checkpoints are kept under review to ensure adjustments are made to maintain the effective focus of the operation.</p><p>  In addition to these targeted policing operations, Community Policing Units have developed a partnership approach to problem solving within the community and Community Garda&iacute; liaise regularly with schools, businesses and homes in the area providing crime prevention advice and assurance to victims of burglary.</p><p>  Local Garda management closely monitors patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the community in Tallaght, to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources to provide the best possible Garda service to the public.</p></reply>

It does not of itself confer rights to free university education or to student support grants.  Decisions on eligibility for such supports are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, although as a matter of practice the eligibility criteria may be based at least in part on the immigration stamp.  In such circumstances any change in immigration practice could indirectly lead to greater exposure to the exchequer and that would have to be borne in mind.</p><p>  Minor children, who are resident in the State in the care of Non-EEA parents granted permission to remain, derive their immigration status from that of their parents.  Consequently any decision on whether a child's status should be changed must have reference to the status of the parent.  Each case would have to be considered on its merits.  As a general rule, however, a dependent would not receive a more favourable status than the person on whom he/she was dependent.  It should also be borne in mind that the parent's status could be of a temporary or limited nature.</p><p>  I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that such students referred to may make an application to change their immigration status by writing to the General Immigration Division, Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.</p></reply>

At the SCOFCAH meeting, experts from all Member States discussed the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to test meat and meat products for the presence of horse DNA and to test for the presence of phenylbutazone (or bute).  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals received the support of the majority of Member States and were agreed by consensus. Ireland strongly supported the Commission&rsquo;s proposals which represent another important step in restoring consumer confidence in this area. </p><p>  It has been agreed that the testing of meat and meat products may commence immediately and will be co-funded by the Commission at a rate of 75 per cent for the first month.  Results from the first round of tests, to be carried out by the end of March, will have to be reported to the Commission by 15th April.  The number of DNA tests, which will be carried out on the basis of representative sampling, is expected to exceed 2,250 across the EU, and this will be supplemented by bute testing on the basis of one sample per 50 tonnes of horsemeat. </p><p>  This testing will contribute to a clearer understanding of the situation across Europe and may be extended for a further two months.  The issue will be discussed again at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 25th February.</p><p>  DNA testing has been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&rsquo;s proactive approach to food authenticity and food fraud control programmes in this country.  It was this testing which first uncovered the issue relating to mislabelling of meat that has since become a matter of concern across Europe.  In the light of recent developments I had separately requested Irish manufacturers of processed meat products to carry out DNA testing and to work with the FSAI in developing testing protocols, to provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products.  The FSAI and my Department met with the meat processing sector on 14th February to agree a national protocol for DNA testing of meat to be applied at retail, catering and processing level in Ireland.  DNA testing will apply from now on as part of routine food testing across the country. The industry has already been engaged in product testing of over 200 samples and results received by the FSAI to date have all been negative for equine DNA (except for a further 5 that tested positive, which related to products previously identified as a problem and which had already been removed from the market).  </p><p>  In addition to the testing for bute agreed to at EU level, my Department and the FSAI are formulating a more comprehensive testing regime for horsemeat to provide full reassurance that no illegal slaughtering of horsemeat is taking place. </p><p>  I believe good progress has been made in securing a significant response at European level to this ongoing controversy.  We now have a co-ordinated EU testing plan in place introduced by the Commission at the behest of the Irish Presidency.  Our investigation continues and information is being shared with other competent authorities and with Europol.  The industry, which has primary responsibility for food placed on the market, has agreed to introduce additional DNA testing in order to provide reassurance to consumers.  Ireland continues to be to the forefront in addressing this issue and we will continue to take whatever actions become necessary in this regard. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-20a.549.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022000085#WRY01300"><p>One of the key policy issues in this CAP reform is the focus on the "greening" of direct payments, which is provided for in the draft regulation on direct payments.  Greening refers to a new payment per hectare to farmers who are following agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment.  The Commission is proposing that 30% of the national ceiling be set aside for these payments.  </p><p>  In order to attract the basic payment and to qualify for the green element, it is proposed that farmers must comply with three compulsory green measures.  The measures proposed are:</p><p>-  retention of permanent grassland (with a 5% tolerance) at farmer level,</p><p>-  crop diversification (3 different crops, minimum coverage of 5% and maximum coverage of 70%), and </p><p>-  establishment of ecological focus areas (7% of land, excluding permanent pasture, devoted to ecological purposes).</p><p>  Ireland supports the idea of encouraging sustainable forms of agriculture, which is at the heart of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, and can support the Commission in its desire to further enhance the green credentials of direct payments.  However, I believe it is preferable to do so in a way that avoids adding excessive bureaucracy.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals give rise to concerns in this respect.  There are also concerns that the proposed structure of the greening payment, which will comprise 30% of the annual national ceiling for direct payments, would hasten the movement towards uniform national or regional payment rates.  In addition, there are practical difficulties with the three greening criteria proposed that need to be resolved.  Almost all Member States share these concerns. </p><p>  Negotiations on greening are still in train so that it is not possible at this point in time to outline the specific detail of the arrangements that will apply.  Efforts to agree a common approach in the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers to greening have focused on the need to maximise flexibility for Member States in the implementation of the three criteria, and to allow other environmentally beneficial activities, namely, participation in agri-environmental and national sustainability schemes, to qualify as &quot;green by definition&quot;. </p><p>  As regards the three criteria, there is resistance to maintaining permanent grassland at individual farm level as proposed by the Commission, there is a general preference for a higher threshold than 3 hectares for crop diversification and to have a two-crop rule for smaller farms, and on ecological focus areas, the discussion is centring on whether there should be a reduction of the 7% requirement or an increase in the qualifying areas, as well as an increase in the 3 hectare threshold.</p><p>  A number of Member States want greening to be optional, i.e. that if a farmer did not meet his/her greening obligations, they would forfeit the green payment but suffer no further penalty on the basic direct payment.  There is also the question of whether the greening requirements should be incorporated into what is known as the Pillar 2 baseline, beyond which farmers would have to satisfy additional environmental criteria in order to receive Pillar 2 payments. </p><p>  Finally, an important issue from an Irish perspective is whether the greening payment is a flat-rate payment.  We would prefer the greening payment to be a percentage of each individual farmer&rsquo;s payment rather than a flat rate.  This is also a key component of the Irish alternative model for the internal convergence of direct payments within Member States.</p></reply>

My colleague Minister Howlin in the Department of Public Service and Reform reactivated the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 during the Summer of 2012.  He proposed to make a number of revisions to the original Bill which also included some minor amendments to the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  Having consulted with the Ombudsman for Children, I availed of the opportunity of Minister Howlin's draft legislation to make further changes to the 2002 Act, taking account of the views of Ms. Logan and her report on the operation of the 2002 Act in March 2012.  The new legislation extends the range of public bodies to come within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  As a result of amendments contained in sections 4 and 22 of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 any reviewable agency which comes under the remit of the Ombudsman will now automatically come under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  Thus the jurisdictions of both offices are aligned and there is legal certainty and clarity on the matter. </p><p>  It appears that the Deputy is seeking the list of bodies that are outside the scope of the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  This information can now be found in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  The First Schedule to that Act lists the &quot;reviewable agencies&quot; and Part II of that schedule lists the elements of those reviewable agencies that does not come within the remit of the Ombudsman or Ombudsman for Children.  The Second Schedule to the Act lists the &quot;exempt agencies&quot;. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-20a.573.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013022000085#WRZ01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 to 217, inclusive, and 221 to 223, inclusive, together.</p><p>  Immediately following my appointment, I set out to address the issues which have been causing unacceptable delays in patients being treated in our hospitals.  I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), as set out in the Programme for Government.  The SDU is working closely with hospitals to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.</p><p>  The Special Delivery Unit is strongly focused on improving patient care and in ensuring that all patients who require in-patient admission are placed in a bed at the earliest opportunity.  It has set a clear target that 95% of all patients will either be discharged or admitted from an Emergency Department in 6 hours and that 100% of all patients will be either admitted or discharged within 9 hours.</p><p>  This target will be achieved by improving service delivery across the entire hospital and not just in the Emergency Department.  To that end, the SDU is working closely with the National Clinical Programmes and with Hospital Management, including Clinical Directors, to radically change the way that care is delivered to patients.    The measure that is perhaps most associated with hospital performance is the number of trolleys.  While the SDU recognises this as a very important measure, the published number does not come from the SDU.  The number that is reported is that published by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the INMO.  They collect this information each morning, five days a week and their data made publicly available on their web-site and on the web-site of the Department of Health.  It is their count which indicates that there has been year-on-year improvement in trolley numbers.</p><p>  Hospitals will face differing levels of demands on their services at different times, due to external factors such as winter vomiting virus, flu and flu-like illnesses.  This is particularly the case in the winter, when both attendances at Emergency Departments and emergency admissions will tend to increase.  During periods of extra demand and pressure, a hospital may open extra bed capacity as part of their escalation and winter planning.  This extra capacity would only be utilised during these times of high demand.  </p><p>  In responding to such pressures, a hospital will take a number of steps, in a systematic and graduated manner, according to the level of pressure being experienced.  In the early stages it will ensure that all ward rounds are happening at the appropriate time so that the number of discharges are maximised, thereby creating the greatest possible number of beds for those that are waiting.  A next step that is taken is to temporarily open additional beds, for example in a ward that might be closed at night, such as a day surgery ward.  A hospital will also contact community services, again to create additional bed spaces by discharging those who can go home with community supports.  </p><p>  Where a patient is moved to a bed providing appropriate dignity, privacy and care facilities and that patient is clearly on a care pathway under a named consultant, the SDU sees no reason why that patient should be included in the trolley count.  However, if a patient is on a trolley or a bed, that is not in a proper space, where their dignity and privacy is comprised, the SDU most definitely expects that patient to be counted in the trolley figures.  All hospitals are expected to adhere to this approach and the SDU has been consistent in this message.  In the event that hospitals are forced to use such measures, it is expected that the patients affected will be accommodated in an appropriate bed as a matter of urgency. </p><p>  All hospitals will track the number of additional beds in use at a given time.  However, it would be misleading to provide the deputy with a single figure which might then be interpreted as the usual situation in a given hospital.  Both the number of &lsquo;regular&rsquo; and &lsquo;additional&rsquo; beds in use at any time changes from day to day, between day and night and between weekdays and weekends.  It is the role of hospital management to actively manage their bed stock according to the demands of the service and according to the available resources.  At all times however, it is expected that their patients are cared for appropriately, with dignity and privacy.  Where this does not occur it is reflected in the INMO and SDU trolley counts.</p></reply>

This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work. </p><p>  The work of the Special Delivery Unit, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget. I believe that pursuing efficiencies through these means will be a far more productive approach than debating the number of beds open or closed at any one time.</p><p>  In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2013 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients. </p><p>  Throughout 2013 hospitals will open and close beds on various wards in order to deliver the planned level of activity. These beds may be closed for a number of reasons, including cost containment, infection control and refurbishment. It is not possible at this time to determine what beds in which wards will be closed and what length of time they will be closed for. The decision to open and close beds is made at hospital management level and approved by the Regional Director of Operations.</p><p>  In relation to bed closures for the week ending 10th February 2013 (the latest data available) there are 688 inpatient beds closed and an additional 3 day case beds.</p></reply>

What the HSE is in fact doing, is ensuring that elective surgical procedures are managed in a safe and equitable manner. </p><p>  Demand for elective surgical procedures continues to grow and in light of this it is only right that our health service ensures (a) that treatments being provided are clinically effective and (b) that patients who will benefit most from surgery are prioritised according to clinical need and are given fast access to treatment.</p><p>  For these compelling reasons the HSE has requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertake a series of health technology assessments (HTA) during 2013. </p><p>  The HIQA assessments will provide advice to the HSE regarding the clinical effectiveness of surgical procedures currently undertaken in Ireland to ensure that the health service is in a position to provide consistent, equitable and clinically effective procedures to patients irrespective of where you live in Ireland. </p><p>  The first report produced by HIQA is currently in draft format and has been put out to public and professional group consultation.

Developments so far under the Programme include the opening of Rapid Access Clinics at four of these centre, including Beaumont, St James&rsquo;s, Galway and Limerick. The Rapid Access clinics are led by Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs). Under the Programme, 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) have been recruited to lead these clinics so that a total of 12 ANPs are now in place across the four centres, delivering services on site and on an outreach basis.</p><p>  The two Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs) planned for Cork and Beaumont under the Programme will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity. Monitoring is required for those patients with the worst effects of epilepsy, and patients at these units will require 24/7 care. </p><p>  The staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified. In regard to the planned EMU at Beaumont, I am advised by the HSE that, having secured recruitment approval from the National Control Group, Beaumont is progressing the recruitment  of  the posts necessary to support the service development. The recruitment of the necessary nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit  as nursing staff come into post. </p><p>  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that it is the intention of the Cork University Hospital management to open the EMU in Quarter 3 of this year and this will be included in the HSE South&rsquo;s 2013 Regional Service Plan.</p></reply>

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. </p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying. </p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams. </p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE is confident that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.</p></reply>

In respect of Part 2 of the Act, which is under the aegis of my Department, a Cross-Sectoral Team was established in 2006 to provide for a joint approach by the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills to the implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  The Team now includes a representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides disabled individuals with an entitlement to an independent assessment of need and a statement of proposed services to be provided, and allows them to pursue a complaint and, if necessary, make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.  Part 2 of the Act was commenced on 1 June 2007 in respect of children under the age of five.  It had been intended to have both the Disability Act 2005 and the EPSEN Act 2004 fully implemented during 2010 for children and young people aged up to 18.  However, in 2008 the then Government decided, in light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of both Acts.  Notwithstanding this the Cross-Sectoral Team continues to meet to address issues of mutual concern for children with disabilities. </p><p>  The Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services which I published last year found that HSE funding is based on an incremental determination process with relevant adjustments made to the previous year&rsquo;s baseline allocation.  In recent years, the funding of new places has been made at local level on the basis of providing services to named individuals, but, once allocated, the funding does not remain associated with or follow that individual but is absorbed into the agency&rsquo;s base.  The move towards a model of funding which is linked to individual need, and which by definition will follow that individual, is encompassed by the recommendations in the VFM Review.  It is intended that the actions recommended in the VFM Review will lay the groundwork for individualised budgeting once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure its long-term viability.  The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from a person-centred supports model and developing the administrative and governance infrastructure necessary for a more accountable and individualised service. </p><p>  The VFM Review also looked at the issue of administration costs, and found that there were many factors influencing the percentage of an agency&rsquo;s budget which was spent on administration, including the size and function of the agency.  The Review found that it was difficult to draw any conclusions about a universal approach to the generation of management/ administration savings, which were likely to vary on a case by case basis.  On the broader front, the VFM Review identified significant opportunities to achieve savings in agencies&rsquo; unit cost base and to reduce average costs across the sector.  Savings in management/ administration costs would be a component in this overall cost reduction.  </p><p>  In terms of driving efficiencies, a number of administrative areas such as Human Resources, Finance, and Procurement are being examined and progressed through the work of the National Consultative Forum.  The Health Service Executive remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.</p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the Disability Sector and to the Social Care area as a whole.

However, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness.  Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation. An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation.   The introduction of this service is a matter between the HSE and Beaumont hospital and the HSE has advised me that these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 estimates process.</p></reply>
