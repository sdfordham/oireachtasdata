It can help to consolidate work already covered during class time and help pupils to prepare for forthcoming class work. It can also promote independent learning.  In addition, it plays an important role in promoting home school links. The national and international research literature indicates that informal at-home involvement such as parents helping with homework and discussing school with their children can contribute to children's achievement.</p><p>  My Department does not issue any guidelines relating to homework being given in schools. It is a matter for each school, at local level, to arrive at its own homework policy. Parents can discuss any matters relating to homework directly with their child's class teacher or with the principal of the school. I do not have any current intention to engage in a consultative process regarding the effectiveness of homework.</p></reply>

In response to this finding, officials in my Department are currently developing guidance for schools on promoting healthy eating, including through the appropriate use of vending machines. In issuing such guidance my intention is not to prohibit the sale of particular foods but to suggest that a range of foods and drinks be available. I do not have the authority to dictate to schools in this manner. </p><p>  Vending machines are an important revenue stream for some schools and it is not my intention to displace this. It is important that we do not dictate to students about what they can and cannot eat. My objective is to ensure instead that our students are given the opportunity to choose from a range of foods, including healthy options, when using vending machines in schools.</p></reply>

Two applicants, namely Educate Together and Lifeways Ireland, which provides the Steiner model, demonstrated strong and similar levels of parental demand for their models.  The level of parental demand, however, for an Educate Together school was stronger. </p><p>  Given all of the circumstances, I decided to award Patronage of a new 8-classroom school to Educate Together to commence operation in 2014.  I also decided to give consideration to the establishment of a further 8-classroom school in 2015 under the patronage of Lifeways Ireland.  This will be subject to confirmation that parental demand will support this model and size of school at that time.  My Department will be in contact with Lifeways Ireland at the appropriate time to progress this matter.</p></reply>

I can advise the Deputy that my Department, working in conjunction with Cork County Council, has identified permanent sites to facilitate planned building projects for the schools in question.  However, whilst negotiations towards the acquisition of such sites are ongoing, I am not in a position due to the commercially sensitive nature of these negotiations to give further details at this time. </p></reply>

I have been very clear that there is currently no agreement between the two parties in coalition on broadening the base of the assessment from household income to reserves, savings or capital assets. However, this matter remains under review and I will be consulting further with my cabinet colleagues before consideration is given to publishing the report.  </p></reply>

The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2008-13 aims to promote and increase access to higher education for under represented groups. A new National Plan is currently being prepared by the National Access Office and will include new targets for participation by under-represented groups across all higher education institutions.</p><p>  The Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) is a college and university admissions scheme which offers places on reduced points and extra college support to school leavers from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The five state funded providers of primary initial teacher education and the majority of the state funded post primary providers of teacher education participate in the HEAR. A number of the other post primary providers operate their own individual access schemes for school leavers.</p><p>  The Department does not have statistics on how many students training to be teachers came through the scheme. Each college or university taking part in the HEAR scheme has set aside a quota of places on a reduced points basis for students entering through the scheme. This quota is different for each third level institution.</p><p>  The main financial support available to students attending higher education is my Department's Student Grant Scheme. Under the student grant scheme, eligible candidates may receive funding provided they are attending an approved course and meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p></reply>

All post primary schools will have high-speed broadband connectivity by the end of this year. How broadband connectivity is distributed within the school is a matter for each school. The Professional Development Service for Teachers provides CPD and guidance on ICT matters. Work is underway within my Department on new guidelines for the inclusion of wireless network infrastructure in new schools.  A new digital strategy to support teaching and learning is under development.  A key part of the strategy development process is to examine the needs of schools including technical support. The supports for the new Junior Cycle, including ICT supports, are currently being discussed with the education stakeholders.  The first round of standardised testing will be in English and mathematics and will take place in Spring 2017 for second year students.</p></reply>

RSE includes the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, and the development of attitudes, beliefs and values about relationships, sexual identity and intimacy.</p><p>Post-primary schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, as set out in the curricular documents that have been provided, within the ethos and value system of the school. Such a programme provides opportunity to explore with students the topic of pregnancy including issues relating to unplanned pregnancy and contraception. </p><p>  There is no explicit provision in the RSE programme for exploring the topic of abortion.  The issue may arise in discussion of other topics such as pregnancy including unplanned pregnancy. Where this occurs, the expectation is that it would be discussed within the context of the school's RSE policy and giving due regard to current legislation.  The manner in which such issues are explored is contingent on the students' needs and the age-appropriateness of the content. </p><p>  My Department has advised schools that if they wish to enhance RSE by inviting visitors to the classroom precise criteria must apply. My Department stipulates that it is of the utmost importance that classroom teachers remain in the classroom with the students and retain a central role in delivery of the core subject matter of the RSE programme. The presence of the classroom teacher should ensure that the school follows appropriate procedures for dealing with any issues that may arise as a result of the external inputs.</p></reply>

It must be acknowledged that the higher education sector has accommodated significant increases in students numbers at a time when both funding and staff numbers have reduced.  The economic circumstances of the country are such that the staffing moratorium introduced across the public sector by the previous Government in 2009 has to be maintained. In contrast to other parts of the public service the higher education sector has been given significant latitude within this moratorium relative to other areas of public expenditure. An Employment Control Framework is in place for the higher education sector which provides institutions with considerable flexibility to fill vacancies, through recruitment or promotions on the basis of meeting an overall ceiling of posts. </p></reply>

It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school. The most recent statistics are for the 2012/13 school year. The national average class size at primary level is 24.7 pupils. However, with over 20,800 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less. The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012. The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014.   A total of 122 schools were due to lose a classroom teacher (73 in the 2012/13 school year and 49 in the 2013/14 school year) as a result of the implementation of this budget measure. The appeals process reduced these losses to 43 in the 2012/13 school year and 32 in the 2013/14 school year.  A total of 53 schools were due not to gain a classroom teacher (21 in 2012/13 and 32 in the 2013/14 school year). The appeals process reduced this figure to 42 schools.  The list of these schools is below.</p><p>  The allocation process for the 2014/15 school year is currently underway. Early indications are that 34 primary schools are due to lose a classroom teacher for the 2014/15 school year and 6 primary schools will not gain a classroom teacher as a consequence of the implementation of the final phase of the Budget 2012 measure. These figures are preliminary at this stage and would be expected to reduce following the appeals process. The final position will be known in the Autumn.</p><p><b>Schools That Lost A Post in 2012/13 School Year</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Roll No</th><th>School Name</th><th>Outcome</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>17174E</td><td>S N Bhrighde, Cuan, Carlow, Co Carlow</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>06998Q</td><td>St Patrick'S Ns, Corlough, Belturbet Post Office, Co Leitrim, Via Co Cavan</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>12099O</td><td>Billis N S, New Inn, Ballyjamesduff, Co Cavan</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>17630E</td><td>S N Maodhog, Cnoc Brighde, Bailieboro, Co Cavan</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>17633K</td><td>S N Eoin Baiste, Ballyvaughan, Via Galway, Co Clare</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>05636A</td><td>Dunmanway Model N S, Dunmanway, Co Cork</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>17079K</td><td>S N Carraig An Ime, Macroom, Co Cork</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>17281F</td><td>Togher N S, Dunmanway, Co Cork</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>17533G</td><td>S N Rathain, Mallow, Co Cork</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>18549D</td><td>S N Cnoc Na Croighe, Cnoc Na Groighe, Mallow, Co Cork</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>19978I</td><td>Maulatrahane Central Ns, Leap, Skibbereen, Co Cork</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>14631O</td><td>Scoil Cholmchille, Malin, Lifford, Co Donegal</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>16384K</td><td>Sn Arainn Mhor Ii, Arainn Mhor, Co Dhun Na Ngall</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>16819T</td><td>S N Gort An Choirce, Leitir Ceanainn, Co Dhun Na Ngall</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>16829W</td><td>S N Loch An Iubhair, Anagaire, Leitir Ceanainn, Tir Chonaill</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>18219F</td><td>Sn Chonaill, Machaire Chlochair, Bun Beag, Co Dhun Na Ngall</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>18251B</td><td>Ayr Hill N S Ramelton, Ramelton, Letterkenny, Co Donegal</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>18286U</td><td>S N Na Hacrai, Ailt An Chorrain, Leitirceanainn, Co Dhun Na Ngall</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>19252I</td><td>S N Umlach, Carrigart, Co Donegal</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>20144M</td><td>Gaelscoil Chois Feabhaill, Gaa, Bun An Phobail, Co Dhun Na Ngall</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>18642Q</td><td>S N Naomh Eoin, Tower Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>10591I</td><td>S N An Ard Mhoir, Carna, Conamara, Co Na Gaillimhe</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>10763L</td><td>Boston N S, Tubber, Gort, Co Galway</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>11261P</td><td>Scoil Mhuire, An Tuairin, Beal An Daingin, Co Na Gaillimhe</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>14377D</td><td>S N Cill Conaill, Cill Conaill, Beal Atha Na Sluagh, Co Na Gaillimhe</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>17760R</td><td>S N Baile An Leasa, Dunmore, Tuam, Co Galway</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>17922R</td><td>Cloghans Hill N S, Tuam, Co Galway</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>18113M</td><td>S N Cill Solain, Killasolan, Caltra, Ballinasloe, Co Galway</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>18289D</td><td>Scoil Naomh Iosef, Castlehackett, Belclare Tuam, Co Galway</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>19283T</td><td>Ballymacward Central Sc, Ballymacward Central Sc, Ballinasloe, Co Galway</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>09938N</td><td>Curranes N S, Castleisland, Co Kerry</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>18233W</td><td>Scoil Paroisteach, Tralee, Co Kerry</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>18756I</td><td>Fibough National School, Caislean Na Mainge, Co Chiarrai</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>19492F</td><td>Sn Oilibhear Naofa, Beal Ata Longphuirt, Co Chiarrai</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>19986H</td><td>S N Eoin Baiste, Garrai Na Dtor, Liospoil, Co Chiarrai</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>17557U</td><td>Scoil Abbain Cillin, Maganey, Athy, Co Kildare</td><td>Successful Appeal</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>14476F</td><td>Wandesforde Mixed N S, Castlecomer, Co Kilkenny</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>18075H</td><td>Rathdomhnaigh N S, Rathdowney, Co Laois</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>17558W</td><td>S N Rosan, Carrigallen, Co.

However, I wish to confirm that I have not received any proposals in the matter from the Patron concerned.  The Deputy will be aware that the decision making authority for any amalgamation or re-organisation of schools in an area belongs to the patron of the schools concerned subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills. The initiative for any amalgamation or re-organisation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, Boards of Management and patron(s). Any such proposal to amalgamate schools must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders and follow decisions taken at local level. Any proposed changes must be planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of parents, teachers and local communities and contributes to an inclusive education system.</p></reply>

The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to both further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities. A claim under the Fund is made on behalf of an eligible student by their college following an assessment of need. Applications cannot be made directly to the Fund by students. Colleges are also responsible for the management of the funding approved for eligible students.  The Fund for Students with Disabilities is managed by the HEA on behalf of my Department.</p><p>  In addition the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a college and university admissions scheme which offers places at reduced points to school leavers with disabilities. Eighteen higher education institutions are currently participating in the scheme. An application for a place through this scheme is made to the Central Applications Office (www.cao.ie). For further information on DARE see also www.accesscollege.ie.  Core funding for access programmes is allocated each year as part of the overall budget of each designated higher education institution. This funding supports the provision of dedicated staff, services and supports for students with disabilities as well as for mature students and school-leavers from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>  Every further and higher education institution has at least one member of staff with responsibility for liaising with students with disabilities, as required by the Disability Act 2005. In addition many institutions have a dedicated Disability Support Service with trained disability officers, learning support officers and other specialist staff.  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2014-2016) is currently being finalised by the National Access Office for my Department. The new plan will include actions and targets that ensure there is continued support for people with disabilities in accessing and participating in higher education.</p></reply>

My Department will also consider applications from schools for funding for additional classrooms where an immediate enrolment need is arising.  As part of the Five Year School Plan, some 40 new schools are to be established across the country to cater for increasing demographics.

My Department's Professional Development Support Service for Teachers - Technology in Education provides guidance and CPD for teachers on the use of ICT for teaching and learning.</p><p>  Work has commenced in my Department on the development of a new digital strategy for schools which will consider a range of topics.  As well as infrastructure requirements a broad range of themes will be considered when developing the new strategy such as:</p><p>- The impact of ICT in teaching and learning and assessment</p><p>-School-wide planning for integration of ICT in teaching and learning</p><p>-Continuing ICT related Professional Development (CPD) for teachers</p><p>-Curriculum-relevant digital content and software resources-exploring views on the opportunities presented by integration of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment, and</p><p>-Obstacles to ICT integration and how they could be overcome.  </p><p>  The new digital strategy for schools will be completed during 2014, and will set out how resources, policies and projects can be prioritised and organised throughout the school system for the next five years.</p></reply>

In some circumstances, a child who is exhibiting extreme behaviours may be brought to another room to ensure the safety of other pupils and until they are calm again.</p><p>  Such rooms or spaces may not be officially designated as 'withdrawal' rooms, e.g. schools may use existing classrooms or other spaces within the school. This is a normal facet of the management of pupil behaviour. Where used, it will normally form part of a school's response to behaviour and part of student support structures, procedures and practices.</p><p>  Some special schools for pupils with severe emotional behavioural disorders, or Autism, where there are a greater number of pupils likely to exhibit distressed behaviour, may use a room which is designated as a safe space for withdrawal purposes, in order to ensure pupil safety and to prevent self-harm or harm to other pupils.</p><p>  These rooms are variously described as 'withdrawal rooms', 'time-out rooms', or 'safe spaces'. I am not aware of any schools who use the term 'isolation rooms'.</p><p>In all cases where such a room is used the child should be under continuous supervision. In circumstances where special schools use designated time out procedures that they should do so with the consent of parents and the school Board of Management.</p><p>  Where a parent, or any other person, has concerns about the care or safety of a child in school they should report these concerns to the Board of Management of the school in the first instance.  Where a parent or other person has a concern about the welfare or protection of a child in a school they may report the matter as a child protection concern to the HSE or to the Department of Education and Skills who will then report any child protection complaint in accordance with my Departments procedures.  I have not received specific advice on whether the use of 'isolation' rooms is a breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, my Department has asked the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to prepare Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In developing this policy advice, the NCSE will consult widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research in relation to this area.  As part of the process to develop this policy advice, the NCSE will consider the issue of the use of withdrawal in schools for children with autism and advise my Department in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years and I am aware of the difficulties faced by schools in relation to these schemes. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.</p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.</p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.  I again wish to re-iterate that the parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.  The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.</p></reply>

This contribution has been levied by Institutes of Technology in respect of apprentices since 2004, with F&Aacute;S/SOLAS paying 70% of the contribution and apprentices themselves paying the remainder. As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS will cease making this payment to the Institutes of Technology and apprentices themselves will pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.  Apprentices will pay the same contribution as students, apportioned for the time they spend in the Institutes. Unlike students, apprentices are paid a training allowance by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in Institutes of Technology. This allowance is equivalent to the wages they receive from their employers for on the job phases and is unaffected by the budgetary changes.  "I am confident that the introduction of the direct payment by apprentices of the Annual Student Contribution will have no effect on completion rates.  Apprentices, who are in receipt of allowances and have invested time and effort to reach phase 4 and 6 of their apprenticeships, see the value of the apprenticeship programme they are on and will remain to completion."</p></reply>

Ministerial visits around this period are organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, promotion and investment interests and to spread a positive message about Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.</p><p>  In terms of the cost of Ministerial visits for Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the Department of each travelling Minister will be responsible for its own costs.  This year, as with previous years, we have issued guidelines to the Embassy network to ensure that visits are undertaken in the most cost efficient way possible.  The overall programme of Ministerial travel is based on recommendations made by the Trade and Promotion Division of my Department in consultation with the Embassy network and State agencies.  The programme was released on 17 February.  The programmes and duration for each Ministerial visit are currently being finalised by the Embassy network, State agencies and relevant Minister&rsquo;s Departments.  It is not proposed currently that a Minister would attend St Patrick&rsquo;s Day events in Northern Ireland in 2014.  This is a matter which can be kept under review, in particular in the light of specific invitations Ministers may receive to appropriate events in Northern Ireland in subsequent years.</p></reply>

On the same day, my German, French and Polish counterparts were in Kiev for discussions with the Government and opposition and we were kept regularly informed during the Council of their efforts to broker an agreement that would help find a negotiated solution to the ongoing crisis there.  The three Foreign Ministers also offered some valuable input into the drafting of the conclusions that were adopted at the end of our meeting.</p><p>  Those conclusions, which are available on the Council website, called for an immediate end to the violence, full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right of access to medical assistance, and for urgent independent investigations into human rights violations.  The importance of the International Advisory Panel set up by the Council of Europe was underlined in this regard.</p><p>  The Council also called on all sides to engage in an inclusive dialogue to de-escalate the situation and find a lasting political solution that would include constitutional reform, the formation of a new government and the creation of conditions for democratic elections.  It was stressed that the prime responsibility for taking the first step to enable such a dialogue rests with President Yanukovych and the Ukrainian authorities.</p><p>  In view of the deteriorating situation, the Council also decided as a matter of urgency to introduce targeted sanctions, including an asset freeze and visa ban against those responsible for human rights violations, violence and use of excessive force.  The EU also agreed to suspend exports licences on equipment that might be used for internal repression.  In my intervention at Council, I recalled that the current crisis began following decisions made about an agreement between the Union and Ukraine and expressed the view that it was only right that the EU should play an active role in finding a solution that is democratic, lasting and fulfils the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people.</p><p>  I have, therefore, warmly welcomed publicly the agreement reached in Kiev last Friday which was brokered by the three EU Foreign Ministers mentioned and which contains the central elements that the Council considered essential for such a solution.  I hope that this agreement will help bring an immediate end to the violence and bloodshed.  It is important that there are clear timeframes for fulfilment of the commitments that have been entered into and that it has been witnessed by representatives of the international community, Russia as well as the EU.</p><p>  These key elements, the rejection of violence and pursuit of constitutional reform, the formation of an inclusive new government and the creation of conditions for democratic elections, remain valid even after the dramatic developments over the weekend.  We look to those now in power in Ukraine to behave in a responsible manner and to work in an inclusive way to prepare the elections that have been scheduled for May.  For our part, the Council conclusions make clear that the EU offer of political association and economic integration remains on the table and that the EU is ready to support Ukraine in the process of reform to deliver a stable, prosperous and democratic future for its citizens.</p></reply>

Qatar has the highest ratio of migrants to citizens in the world; nearly 88 per cent of the total population are foreign workers, employed largely in construction, services and domestic work.  The presence of large numbers of migrant workers in the Gulf area, especially in construction, is of course a long-standing phenomenon and does not relate solely to the World Cup.</p><p>  In November 2013, following an eight day investigative visit to the Emirate, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, urged the Qatari authorities to ensure that its labour laws are reformed so that migrants are granted the right to form and join trade unions, have access to proper grievance procedures, and are granted a minimum wage.  He also called on the Government to review the foreign worker sponsorship system (Kafala) which has been linked to migrant workers&rsquo; abuse.  Under the system, expatriate employees are barred from changing jobs or leaving the country without their sponsor&rsquo;s permission.  Mr. Cr&eacute;peau welcomed some positive legislative developments in the area such as the provision which makes it illegal for sponsors to confiscate passports, and called for effective enforcement of the law.</p><p>  I fully support the findings of Mr. Cr&eacute;peau and call on the Qatari Government to continue to cooperate with his office and the UN International Labour Organisation and to implement their recommendations in order to improve the situation of migrant workers and their families in the country.  I believe it is critical that Qatar proves it is making real efforts to improve the protection of the rights of all workers, including construction workers, ahead of the FIFA World Cup scheduled for 2022.  In this regard, I welcome FIFA&rsquo;s promises to demand high standards of workers&rsquo; rights and its recent request for a detailed report on improvements implemented following FIFA President Sepp Blatter&rsquo;s visit to the Emirate last November.</p><p>  In relation to the specific issue of the deaths of 455 Indians in Qatar over the course of 2012 and 2013, as recently published by the Indian Embassy in Doha, it should be noted that, according to reports, a spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry has stated that the &lsquo;overwhelming number&rsquo; of these deaths were due to natural causes.  There are approximately 500,000 Indians living in the Emirate.  The Indian authorities have stated that the number of Indian deaths in the last five years have remained consistent and are not attributable to any one cause.  The Qatar National Human Rights Committee has called on the Indian Embassy to provide further details on the circumstances of the deaths and I would support this.  My officials will continue to closely monitor the issue.</p><p>  More broadly, the promotion and protection of migrant workers rights throughout the world, including in Qatar, will remain a priority for Ireland.  My Department will avail of every appropriate opportunity to raise the issue both bilaterally, through the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi which is also accredited to Qatar, and through relevant multilateral channels, including through the UN and EU human rights mechanisms.</p></reply>

The status of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) has been the subject of various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations.  The issue has also been discussed at the UN&rsquo;s special committee on decolonisation every year since 1964.  In its most recent resolution adopted on 20 June 2013, the committee expressed its regret that in spite of widespread international support for negotiations between Argentina and the UK, implementation of the relevant General Assembly resolutions had not yet started.  I would encourage the UK and Argentina, two countries with which Ireland has excellent bilateral relations, to pursue a peaceful resolution of their differences on this matter, based on the relevant UN resolutions.</p></reply>

Accounts of appalling atrocities have been known for many years.  This is the first time that they have been presented to the international community in such a detailed manner.</p><p>  I want to pay tribute to the witnesses who have shared their first hand experiences of life in the DPRK, as well as the testimony of families of nationals of other countries who were abducted and held against their will in DPRK.  I commend their bravery in speaking out, many of them in public hearings.  The atrocities perpetrated by the DPRK authorities make chilling reading and expose the brutality of what is described in the report as a totalitarian state &ldquo;which seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens&rsquo; lives and terrorise them from within&rdquo;.  There is clearly a case to answer and I call on the DPRK authorities to engage with the UN process.  The entire international community has an obligation to the people of the DPRK who have suffered so grievously.</p><p>  The Commission will formally present its findings to the United Nations Human Rights Council on 17th March.  The EU and Japan will table a resolution on human rights in DPRK during the March session of the HRC which will seek to take forward the recommendations made by the Commission.  Drafting of the resolution is at a preliminary stage but I can assure you that Ireland will strongly support efforts to ensure follow-up to the recommendations, including those on accountability for human rights violations.  It is particularly important to ensure accountability where violations of human rights may amount to crimes against humanity.  The Commission&rsquo;s findings in this regard must be taken very seriously.  We are consulting with EU partners and Japan on how to reflect this in the resolution under discussion.</p></reply>

When I addressed the UN General Assembly on 28 September 2013, I pledged Ireland&rsquo;s full support to the efforts of the UN Secretary General in his efforts to lead a global campaign for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender rights.  I also had the honour of addressing the Annual Conference of the International Lesbian and Gay Association of Europe (ILGA-Europe) on 21 October 2012, when I affirmed that LGBTI rights are human rights.</p><p>  At the UN, Ireland co-sponsored the landmark Resolution at the Human Rights Council (HRC) on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity in 2011.  As members of the HRC, we will continue to promote the advancement of LGBTI rights, including through the Universal Periodic Review process.  At the EU level, Ireland engaged extensively in the drafting process for the new EU Guidelines on the enjoyment of all human rights by LGBTI persons, which were adopted at the final Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union on 24 June 2013.</p><p>  I am deeply concerned by the news that Uganda is enacting legislation to criminalise homosexuality.  I have made it clear, including in direct talks with President Museveni, that the enactment of this legislation would affect our valued relationship with Uganda.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, has engaged actively with the Ugandan Parliament and President Museveni in an effort to halt the regressive and discriminatory Anti-Homosexuality Bill.  It is in clear conflict with Uganda&rsquo;s binding international obligations to uphold human rights.  It is a threat to Uganda&rsquo;s gay community and an affront to all those who value tolerance, respect and dignity of all people.</p><p>  I am also concerned at the recent adoption of the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act in Nigeria.  I welcome and fully support the statement of 15 January by the EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, which highlighted the EU&rsquo;s serious concerns with this legislation.  We will continue to urge the Nigerian authorities to reconsider the Act in light of Nigeria&rsquo;s constitutional and international obligations and in the meantime to exercise the utmost restraint in its enforcement.</p><p>  Our aid programme is amongst the best in the world and has a clear focus on poverty reduction and on assisting some of the most marginalised people in the developing world.  Good governance and human rights are key elements of our development programme and we provide assistance to civil society organisations promoting human rights and also for Human Rights Commissions tasked with upholding human rights in some of our Partner Countries.  Our aid programme and our international reputation enables us to dialogue directly with Governments on a range of human rights issues.  We also do this in close cooperation with other donor partners.  This maximises our influence in this enormously important area.  We are also ready to take action, as we have done in Uganda, when serious issues of governance arise.  But we also want to ensure that the poorest of the poor are not penalised for the faults of their governments and we seek to look at ways of delivering assistance effectively for the benefit of the poor.  Ireland will continue its efforts internationally to promote human rights, including LGBTI rights, and to give support to organisations and institutions that are active in the human rights field, many of whom are operating in very difficult environments.</p></reply>

This was further enhanced by the 2012 Consumer Protection Code.  Occasionally, the Central Bank receives individual consumer complaints about mis-selling and these are looked at on case by case basis.  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman may make recommendations to the Bank on measures to deal with persistent patterns of complaints.</p><p>  In 2009 the then Financial Regulator conducted a four part examination of selected credit institutions, life insurance firms and investment and stockbroking firms in relation to the suitability of investment products sold to older consumers.  A number of issues of concern were identified during this examination such as instances where basic client information such as income and assets/liabilities were not recorded on the fact finding documentation of firms, not all institutions offer older customers the option of having a third party present at a sales meeting, and in certain cases firms did not give customers any advice on the level of emergency funds that should be maintained to provide for medical or other long term care expenses.</p><p>  More recently, the Central Bank of Ireland has been conducting an investigation into the sales of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI).  Eleven firms were required to review sales and, where appropriate, offer a refund to their customers where the PPI sale is found to be in breach of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code) since July 2007.  The aim of this Review is to provide a straight-forward mechanism for the consumer to be redressed where policies were sold in breach of the Code, without any cost to the consumer.  The Review should eliminate the need for consumers who were sold PPI by the firms above since 1 July 2007 to engage third parties or go through a legal process.  The latest  information on the PPI review is that the review of the 11 firms is drawing to close and all customers covered by this review have been contacted, with the vast majority of those eligible for a refund, having already received their refunds.  I expect the Central Bank will issue a statement in Q1 when the investigation has been completed to its satisfaction.  If the Deputy is aware of any additional specific issue with mis-selling, I would appreciate if he could provide the relevant details to my Department or directly to the Central Bank.</p></reply>

However, the difficulty of forecasting severe weather events means that it is difficult to quantify the cost of a state-funded financial aid package in any particular year.  These costs would be in addition to the normal infrastructure costs which arise from flooding such as repair of roads, bridges etc.  Furthermore, there exists a very real possibility that industry would have a strong incentive to discontinue the providing flood cover to policyholders in medium and high risk areas thus increasing the potential cost of the scheme over time.  So it has the potential to undermine the nature of the existing private insurance regime, making it difficult to withdraw an indemnity, even if introduced on a short-term basis.</p><p>  Humanitarian assistance is being provided in areas affected by flooding under a new Department of Social Protection Humanitarian Assistance Scheme which has been allocated of up to &euro;25 million.  It provides means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes as a result of the flooding.  Government policy in relation to flooding aims to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible.  The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences based on a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p><p>  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.

Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p><p>  In addition, the OPW and the Insurance Ireland have been engaged in discussions to agree on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW or, in certain instances, by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.  There is agreement in principle but with some operational details to be finally sorted by the insurance companies.  The outcome of these discussions means that the insurance industry will have a much greater understanding of the extent of the protection provided by flood defence works and will therefore be in a position to provide the necessary flood cover to householders in areas where works have been completed.</p><p>  In cases where individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance believe that they are being treated unfairly, they can contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.

In broad terms, the review will look at the most cost effective means to address flood insurance problems and will look at the experience and proposals in other countries, including those brought to my attention by the Deputy.  In assessing these, care has to be taken that the proposed solutions do not put in place arrangements which, over time, would weaken the provision of insurance cover by the market with possible negative long-term consequences for the economy.</p><p>  When my Officials have completed the review, I will examine it and report to Cabinet on what measures, if any, are needed to improve the availability of flood insurance cover.  Government policy in relation to flooding aims to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible.  The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences based on a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p><p>  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.  Works are completed on a prioritised basis.  Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p></reply>

Flood cover claims are generally significant and in order to provide such cover, insurance companies would say that they have to be satisfied that the potential for such floods arising is low.  It is a matter for the industry to set its premiums and make provisions at the appropriate level to ensure that it can cope with flood and subsidence issues.  Furthermore, as a matter of course, insurance companies carry out reviews of the risks they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make decisions to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk, such as homes in an area which is prone to subsidence.  Insurance Ireland indicate that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover and the percentage for policyholders with household insurance which include subsidence cover is higher than 98%.</p><p>  Government policy in relation to flooding aims to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible.  The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences based on a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.  This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.  Works are completed on a prioritised basis.  Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p><p>  I have no plans at present to introduce legislation relating to flooding insurance.  However, the Deputy will be aware that as part of the response to the recent flooding events, the Department of Finance is currently undertaking a review of the availability of flood insurance cover.  When the review is complete, I will examine it and will report to Cabinet on what measures, if any, are needed to improve the availability of flood insurance cover.</p><p>  As regards industry initiatives, my colleague, Minister of State Hayes at the Office of Public Works has taken the lead role in discussions with the insurance industry about improving the provision of insurance cover in areas where remedial works are being carried out and OPW is near agreement on a data-sharing platform which will facilitate the transfer of detailed information on completed OPW flood relief schemes on an on-going basis.  This will allow the insurance industry to take into account the flood protection measures when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed.</p><p>  While the agreement on the memorandum of understanding with the insurance industry is to be welcomed as a first step, ultimately, there are no plans to introduce legislation in this area and it will be a matter for the insurance companies themselves to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works but they are committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk and it is to be expected that this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in areas that are protected by completed schemes.</p></reply>

As with the sale of any NAMA asset what a purchaser does with the asset following the sale is a commercial matter for them.</p><p>  NAMA is directly supporting 2,000 jobs in Northern Ireland currently and further indirect employment through the participating institutions, service providers and across the professional services sector.</p><p>  NAMA is making a positive impact in Northern Ireland through these and other initiatives, such as in the area of social housing.</p></reply>

This approach was primarily adopted to delay the application of the carbon tax to solid fuel in the residential sector to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply.  Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011.</p><p>  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels. As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.</p><p>  As I was aware of the potential impact on lower income households, I chose not to introduce the carbon tax on solid fuels until after the 2012/2103 winter period and I opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1 May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2.  While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  Accordingly I do not intend to defer the further increase of &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emissions from 1 May 2014.</p></reply>

The German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.</p><p>  Officials at my Department with assistance from staff of the NPRF have worked quickly to investigate ways to ensure that the benefit of this cooperation to Irish SMEs can be maximised.</p><p>  A small party of my officials travelled to a meeting with their counterparts in Berlin in early December and a week later a similar meeting was held at KfW's headquarters in Frankfurt. Officials from KfW and the German Ministry have also met with the project team from Ireland in Dublin for a further exchange shortly before Christmas. Both sides have been represented at senior management level for each engagement. In addition, there have been regular conference calls between the parties since then.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, KfW channel their funding for SMEs in Germany through a system of on-lending using commercial banks in Germany as the distribution mechanism. Typically the SMEs can avail of KfW funding at different terms and conditions applicable to that offered directly by the financial institutions. This model is similar to the on lending arrangements available to Irish domestic institutions using funds from the European Investment Bank.</p><p>  The precise arrangements for the structure, level of funding and distribution options are the subject of the discussions between the relevant officials at present and will have to adhere to EU State Aid considerations.  Experience in other countries suggests that any lending facilitated by a state sponsored investment institution like KfW is generally complementary to SME lending already taking place in an economy and can in fact assist in improving both the supply and demand for finance. In essence we will be supplying the banks with an improved source of finance with specified lending products  that will attract SME customers and we'd expect that banks will have no issue matching the demand with the credit supplied by the Strategic Investment Bank.</p><p>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the Irish economy and play a crucial role in employment growth in our country.  Since March 2011 Government policy has concentrated on ensuring that viable micro, small and medium sized enterprises have access to capital, equity and debt funding from a more diverse range of sources. The potential new arrangement with KfW, which my officials are currently exploring, represents a continuation of this Government's concerted focus on ensuring that viable SMEs have access to finance in a manner that supports economic recovery and employment growth. </p></reply>

This scheme came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015. It provides for tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence. </p><p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (inclusive of VAT).  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out. </p><p>  The scheme will be administered through Revenue s online systems. Contractors will be required to inform Revenue in advance of details of works to be carried out and will also be required to notify Revenue in relation to any payments received in respect of the works. Homeowners will be able to view the information provided to Revenue by the contractor through the Revenue electronic systems and will also claim the relief through those systems. It is anticipated that this system will 'go live' in early April 2014. Contractors will need to enter the details of works carried out within 28 of the electronic system becoming available. Until the system is live and details of works carried out are entered, there are no figures available on the incentive.</p><p>  Full details of the scheme are available on the Revenue website at    along with a newly produced  Guide for Homeowners . Copies of the Guide are being distributed to all local Revenue Offices and Citizens Advice centres.</p></reply>

However, USC and PRSI will continue to be payable. If a loss is incurred then loss relief will be available in the normal manner.</p><p>  The business must be un-incorporated i.e., it must not be registered as a company. In order to claim this relief, the individual must file a tax return notwithstanding that there may be no liability to tax.  This initiative is an employment activation measure that provides a much-needed incentive for people to start their own business and to reduce their dependence on welfare payments.  There is no requirement for an individual to register in order to claim the relief. Instead, the individual will claim the relief by completing the relevant boxes in his or her annual income tax return. Therefore, until the individuals who avail of this relief file their tax returns for the 2014 tax year next year, it will not be possible to know how many individuals are availing of this relief.

Purchasers of mortgage loans will be required to honour the legal terms of the loan agreements. Nonetheless I am fully aware of the concerns raised by the IBRC mortgage holders regarding continued protection under the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) for those mortgage holders following the sale of the loan book by the Special Liquidators. </p><p>  The Special Liquidators have, following due consideration, decided that the sale of the residential mortgage book in portfolios was the best method available to maximise market interest and returns within the timelines set out in the Ministerial Instructions. It was not possible for me to interfere in the sales process developed by the Special Liquidators to compel them to sell the residential mortgage portfolio to regulated entities as to do so would have had a negative impact on the return achievable by the Special Liquidators. Such action would have left me open to challenge by other creditors of the bank. </p><p>  I am keenly aware that the potential loss of protection under CCMA is a source of great concern to the mortgage holders of the bank. The continued applicability of CCMA depends on the regulatory status of the ultimate acquirer of the IBRC portfolio which will not be known with certainty until that process is completed next month. However I have instructed my officials to examine the issue fully, in consultation with the Central Bank and the Attorney General's office with a view to bringing forward a solution if required. </p><p>  While work is ongoing in that respect I also am pleased to note that some unregulated firms have already indicated that they intend to voluntarily adopt the CCMA in order to manage acquired loans as they believe that following CCMA is in the ultimate best interests for both the business and their customers. I fully expect that this would also be the case in the event that the IBRC portfolio was acquired by such organisations.</p><p>  It is also important to note that in the event that NAMA acquire the IBRC residential mortgage book they will be mindful of their legal obligations and are likely to apply best practice in relation to CCMA, furthermore they have confirmed that no borrower will be in any worse a position. </p></reply>

I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, specifically risks from illicit traders who constitute part of the overall shadow economy.  </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Revenue chairs a working group, known as the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG), which includes representatives from employer and business organisations, trade unions and other Government Departments and agencies.  The HEMG provides a forum for the various stakeholders to exchange views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy.  Regional and sectoral liaison groups have been established to facilitate greater local interaction between business and the relevant Government Departments and agencies.  Through these fora and bilateral engagement with business representative organisations, Revenue encourages the supply of useful specific information about shadow economy activity, and has expressed some disappointment at the poor engagement on this aspect.</p><p>  Regarding Oireachtas members, it is open to any of the relevant Oireachtas Committees to examine matters appropriate to their remit and the sale of illicit goods, including illegal fuels, tobacco and counterfeit products, has been discussed with Revenue officials by a number of Oireachtas Committees in recent times.  For example, the Joint Committee on Health &amp;amp; Children has considered the question of illicit tobacco sales, and the Joint Committee on Transport &amp;amp; Communications has discussed the sale of illegal fuels.  Indeed, as you will be aware in your capacity as Chair, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation has also examined wider shadow economy issues, including its impact on legitimate trade.</p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, in her appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts last week in connection with the 2012 Annual Report of the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General, was asked by the Chairman of the Committee to provide a report for the Committee on the current state of play concerning the sale of illegal fuels and tobacco.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the whole subject of the illicit sale of goods and the consequent loss of revenue to the State is a major priority for my Department and for the Revenue Commissioners.  Having considered the Deputy s proposal, I believe that the setting up of an informal working group could be a useful additional initiative to complement the very important initiatives that I have already set out.  I have asked my officials to contact the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to discuss the arrangements for such an informal working group.</p></reply>

The couple are jointly assessed and in receipt of both an occupational pension and taxable Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments.  The tax in respect of the DSP payments is collected through reduction of the tax credits allocated to the occupational pension.  In 2013 both spouses were individually in receipt of (DSP) payments. One spouse was in receipt of &euro;230.30 per week up to 27/6/2013 while the other spouse was receiving &euro;172.70 per week. The latter person's DSP payment ceased on 27/6/2013, and was replaced from 28/6/2013 onwards by an increase in the other spouse's pension to &euro;436.60 per week.  The change from two payments to one had an effect on the combined tax credits.  When both had individual sources of income, they were each entitled to PAYE tax credits of &euro;1,650 per spouse.  In 2014, since only one spouse is in receipt of pension income, only one PAYE credit of &euro;1,650 applies.  In addition the aggregate amount of DSP income for 2014 will be &euro;22,703.20 compared with the combined DSP payments in 2013 of &euro;21,863.20. The effect of this is that tax credits available are further reduced by &euro;168 (&euro;840 @ 20%) in order to collect the additional tax due on this increased income.  The total impact of the changes outlined is that tax credits for 2014 are reduced by &euro;1,818 (being &euro;1,650 in respect of the PAYE Credit and &euro;168 in respect of the increased pension income).</p></reply>

The Pilot Project involved the 3 Irish retail banks - Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and permanent tsb. It is intended that those institutions will be involved in the roll out of the Standard Bank Account.  It will not necessarily be the case that the next phase of work on the Standard Bank account will be limited to these institutions and more extensive participation would be welcome to ensure that the broadest possible reach to the financially excluded can be achieved. </p><p>  The Financial Inclusion Working Group, chaired by my Department includes An Post together with stakeholders from other Government Departments, the Central Bank of Ireland, retail banks, the National Consumer Agency and voluntary sector organisations. The Report of the Working Group on the Pilot project noted the view of stakeholders that one of the key elements required as part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a Standard Bank Account is greater involvement by An Post and the credit unions.  This was seen as necessary to have the best possible channel for reaching the target cohorts. The Report also noted that barriers of existing infrastructure such as access to the clearing system had prohibited their more extensive involvement to date.  My Department is currently engaged in a series of bilateral discussions with the stakeholders in order to best determine next steps following the pilot.  The role of An Post is one of the issues which will be dealt with as part of this process.  </p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p><p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

Such policy must comply with the procedures as set out in my Department's Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools and should be completed by each school as early as possible in the current school year but, in any event, by no later than Easter.</p><p>  The Well-being team within the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) undertook a design process to produce a range of support materials to assist schools in the policy development process. The support will be made available in two phases.</p><p>  Phase1: Principal teachers from primary and post-primary schools will attend a 2.5 hr workshop during which the PDST facilitators will mediate the 2013 Anti-Bullying Procedures, review bullying as a behaviour including its characteristics and impact, and provide detailed guidance on the development of an Anti-Bullying Policy within the school. The legal framework will be explored and relevant documents will be referenced. Examples of these include:</p><p>- Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools (2013) - Circular 045/2013</p><p>- The Department's Template for Anti-Bullying Policy 2013</p><p>- Education Act (1998)</p><p>- Equal Status Acts, 2000 to 2004</p><p>- Education (Welfare) Act, 2000</p><p>- NEWB Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools 2008</p><p>- Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools, 2011</p><p>  Key to the success of the school's anti-bullying policy is the creation of a positive school culture and climate.  Therefore, in order to ensure that all school personnel would be supported, the PDST team created a webcast platform where the support material can be access by all school personnel. The initial webcast will be broadcast next week for primary schools and for post-primary schools in early March. All support materials are to be made available in both Gaeilge and English.</p><p>  Phase 2: During Autumn 2014 the PDST will provide a one-day seminar for principals where the focus will be on prevention and intervention strategies at whole-school level.</p><p>  The support provided by the PDST will help ensure schools meet their obligations under the new procedures, in particular, the promotion of the anti-bullying policy among the school community and the measures in place to develop a positive and inclusive climate in the school.</p></reply>

The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and resource teaching allocations for primary schools, was updated for all primary schools from the 2012/13 school year and now includes the traveller pupils who had previously been supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts under the General Allocation Model.</p><p>  Limited alleviation measures were put in place to assist schools who had high concentrations of Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/hours, in the context of the limited resources available.  A total of 141 posts have been allocated to schools for this purpose.  81 posts were used to readjust Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) allocations to include Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts.  38 alleviation posts were provided for schools that had high numbers or concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTT posts and a further 22 alleviation posts were allocated to schools who had the highest percentage of traveller pupils previously supported by RTT posts, in comparison to other schools, taking into account their overall pupil populations, and who had not qualified for the first round of alleviation posts.  Of these 60 alleviation posts, 40 were allocated to primary schools and 20 to post primary schools.</p></reply>

The database will allow the Department to more closely monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes of pupils at primary level, to validate school enrolment returns for grant payment and teacher allocation purposes, and to follow up on pupils who do not make the transfer from primary to post primary level. The system is currently in development. A pilot is scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 2014, involving a small number of volunteer schools.  The main population of the database with existing pupil data will take place during the 2014-2015 academic year, and the database is scheduled to come fully into operation in the 2015-2016 academic year.</p></reply>

These posts were in 173 DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 Schools, 163 post primary schools, 16 rural DEIS schools and 17 non DEIS schools.  Due to conflicting reports of posts being lost in these schools, my Department produced a report on the impact of the withdrawal of these legacy posts from Band 1 and Band 2 Schools.  Following the Government's decision of 21 February 2012 in the matter a number of schools continued to retain disadvantaged legacy posts from previous disadvantage schemes on a year to year basis and only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for individual schools including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process in 2012. The overall objective of the reforms is to enable the teacher allocation and redeployment process to operate more smoothly and efficiently, to give a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools, give earlier certainty to schools about their staffing allocations and, where possible, simplify and streamline existing processes and give greater autonomy to schools. This also removed the need to directly notify every DEIS school of its staffing levels each year.</p><p>  As the teaching allocation to schools, including disadvantage legacy posts, are enrolment-based, this determines whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year. Some schools seemed to be under the impression that the Government decision of February 2012 in relation to legacy posts, implied that they would retain legacy posts, regardless of changes in enrolment. I wish to clarify that legacy posts are retained in schools from year to year, only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September.  It is not my intention to review this decision.</p></reply>

Unlike most other areas of the public service teaching vacancies are being filled in accordance with published Department criteria. The Government has prioritised, as best as possible, the filling of front-line posts in the Education sector within the constraints of the Employment Control Framework. For example, schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations. The redeployment of surplus permanent teachers is the first mechanism to fill teaching posts in schools. This is key to the ability of my Department to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers. Thereafter, teaching posts are filled in the normal manner through the recruitment process at individual school level.</p><p>  Teacher retirements occur each month throughout the year, however, the vast majority retire at the end of August. It is not possible at this early stage to predict the overall retirement levels in 2014. Apart from some 75 teachers who must retire at the end of August on reaching mandatory retirement age, any teacher who satisfies the age and service requirement may opt to retire at any time throughout the year. However the timing of their application is entirely a matter for the individual teacher.  My Department requested that teachers who intend to retire in 2014, and who satisfy the age and service thresholds for pension, would make application for pension to the Pension Unit of the Department by 31 March 2014.  This is to facilitate the timely payment of their pension benefits.</p></reply>

DEIS is part of a continuum of interventions delivered by my Department to address educational disadvantage including early school leaving from pre-school through second-level education. This includes second-chance education and training and access measures to increase participation in further and higher education for the minority of our young people who, for various reasons, leave education early without the knowledge and skills they need to support them in later life. A further element of this continuum is the ongoing development of provision for pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>  It is particularly encouraging to see the retention rate in DEIS schools increase substantially, from 68.2% for the 2001 cohort to 80.4% for the 2007 cohort. The retention rates of pupils, who entered the first year of the junior cycle in 2007, represents a full cohort of students to have DEIS resources available to them throughout their second level education.</p><p>  The Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency has developed a new Integrated Model of Service Delivery which involves the Educational Welfare Service, the Home School Community Liaison Scheme, the School Completion Programme as well as schools in order to improve service delivery to schools, children and their families.  This new service model is designed to facilitate a standardisation of service delivery across the country whilst also taking into consideration the need for flexibility given the unique nature of difficulties presenting in individual children's lives.  I understand that pilot testing of the model is currently underway with full service roll-out anticipated in 2014.</p></reply>

Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>  The National Council for Special Education Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  The NCSE also recently published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School.

The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  Finally, where a parent seeks to enrol their child in a school and that school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p></reply>

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.</p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years and I am aware of the difficulties faced by schools in relation to these schemes.  Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.</p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.</p><p>  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget.  Of course it is unfair, but equally, the <i>status quo</i> was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.</p><p>  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.  The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.</p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental/loan scheme and will not therefore qualify for funding.</p></reply>

Unlike most other areas of the public service teaching vacancies are being filled in accordance with published Department criteria.  The Government has prioritised, as best as possible, the filling of front-line posts in the Education sector within the constraints of the Employment Control Framework.  For example, schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations.</p><p>  The redeployment of surplus permanent teachers is the first mechanism to fill teaching posts in schools.  This is key to the ability of my Department to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.  Thereafter, teaching posts are filled in the normal manner through the recruitment process at individual school level.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the various budget measures that have taken place in recent years can limit the employment opportunities for newly qualified teachers.  A number of measures have been taken to alleviate difficulties for newly qualified teachers.  My Department has directed managerial authorities of schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones,and the JobBridge National Internship Scheme can provide newly qualified teachers with opportunities to gain experience and to undertake the necessary teaching duties to complete the process of probation.</p><p>  The Teaching Council is the body with statutory responsibility for the procedures and criteria for the probation of teachers including periods of probation.  In recent years, the minimum service requirement for probation purposes has been decreased from 170 days to 100 days.  A newly qualified teacher who may not be able to complete the probationary requirements within the period specified by the Teaching Council may apply to the Council for an extension to the period allowed.</p><p>  My Department is aware of the rising enrolments in schools both at Primary and Post Primary level and is forecasting an increase of more than 45,000 primary pupils and 25,000 post primary pupils by the start of the 2017 school year.  I have already announced that 20 new primary and 20 post primary schools are to be built to meet those rising enrolments.</p><p>  Alongside the building of infrastructure, we are also preparing for the need to have more teachers in the system.  I have already asked the Teaching Council, the professional body for teachers, for advice on the matter of teacher supply and demand.  The Council is currently preparing that advice with the overall goal of ensuring that there is timely information to inform the system generally and planning in my Department.  I expect to receive an initial report from the Teaching Council later in the year.</p></reply>

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme. </p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years and I am aware of the difficulties faced by schools in relation to these schemes.  Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.</p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools. </p><p>  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget.  Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.</p><p>  The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.  The school referred to by the Deputy indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental/loan scheme and will not therefore qualify for funding.</p></reply>

Input from enterprise is also provided for through representation on boards and agencies across the education and training sector.  The development and delivery of targeted skills initiatives such as the ICT Skills Action Plan, Springboard and Momentum involve close interaction with enterprise.  These initiatives have been very successful.  For example, implementation of the ICT Action Plan 2012 aimed to double the number of graduates in relevant disciplines by 2018.  The Higher Education system is now set to meet that target by 2015.  In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which is funded by my Department, plays a pivotal role in advising on the skills needs of enterprise and its research and reports inform programme development by education and training providers.</p><p>  Meeting the requirements of industry is a high priority for the education system and a wide ranging programme of reform is currently being rolled out across all levels of the system to ensure the continued development of skills appropriate to enterprise.  One of the core objectives under the new Performance Framework for the higher education system is meeting Ireland's human capital needs across the spectrum of skills areas through both core funding and specifically targeted initiatives.  I am expecting the first annual System Performance Report from the Higher Education Authority in coming months which will set out the level of performance of the system in relation to meeting skills needs.</p></reply>

The level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained and increased for this school year. </p><p>  The previous Government capped the number of SNA posts at 10,575 in December 2010.  In December 2013, this Government agreed to increase the cap on SNAs by 390, increasing by 170 posts to 10,745 at the end of 2013, and by a further 220 posts to 10,965 at the end of 2014.  These additional posts provided will enable the National Council for Special Education to continue to allocate support to children who need it in order that they may fully participate in and benefit from their education. </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my decision last June to authorise the NCSE to maintain the level of resource teaching allocations to be provided for students with special educational needs for the current school year to the 2012/13 levels.  This decision resulted in the subsequent allocation of an additional 455 posts in October to maintain resource teaching provision at the same levels as last year.</p><p>  Provision is therefore being made this year for up to 10,745 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), over 10,700 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. Provision is also being made for over 740 Special Classes attached to mainstream schools at reduced pupil teacher ratios, enhanced capitation for special schools and special classes, and provision for special transport arrangements and assistive technology support. </p><p>  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs to be enrolled to.  Supports will continue to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs.  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.  </p><p>  The overall level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs, enrolled in all schools, to ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements, for both the current school year and in future school years.  Approximately 15% of the entire budget of my Department &ndash; some &euro;1.3 billion &ndash; was spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs in 2012/13.  The provision for the 2013/14 school year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that the overall level of funding for special education has been protected, and increased, despite the ongoing severe financial position.  There has been no reduction in the level of funding to support children with Special Educational needs since this Government came to office. </p><p>  The level of investment being provided will ensure that provision can continue to be made to provide for the educational requirements of children with special educational needs, including those with Autism and Aspergers, enrolled in all schools and to ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements. </p><p>  In relation to the number of school places available for children with special educational needs throughout the country, and in County Kildare, the policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.  All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs to be enrolled to.  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p></reply>

In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion. </p><p>  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have published a draft General Scheme for an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, 2013 as well as draft regulations for discussion ahead of enacting legislation. These are available on my Department's website.</p><p>  I have referred the draft proposals to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, to allow a full public discussion of the proposed legislative framework, including inputs from parents, education partners and other stakeholders.  I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure the legislation strikes the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

In June 2011, I announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established up to 2017 to cater for increasing demographic demand across a number of locations. This includes some twenty new post-primary schools, including a new post primary school for Maynooth, which will assist in servicing enrolment demand in North Kildare. The announcement included the provision of an Aonad in the Maynooth school. In addition, my Department has confirmed, that if sufficient demand for education through the medium of Irish in the Aonad is demonstrated over a four year cycle, consideration will be given by my Department to the establishment of an independent Gaelchol&aacute;iste.

Given the level of demand on the student grant budget from first time students and students that are progressing with their studies to a higher level, there are no plans at present to change the arrangements in place.  Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social Protection. It should be noted that out of a total number of some 92,000 applications for the academic year 2013/2014 assessed by SUSI by the 18th February 2014, some 1% of students were refused on the basis that they had previously completed a course at the same level.</p><p>  My Department has done considerable work focused on getting unemployed people back to work. Springboard is a specific initiative that targets funding to enable unemployed people who have lost their jobs to up skill or reskill in areas where there are identified labour market skill shortages or employment.

Since then, good progress has been made on implementing actions designed to help prevent and tackle bullying in primary and second level schools.  These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyber bullying, are addressed. </p><p>New National Procedures on Anti-Bullying, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were launched last September.  These are currently being adopted and implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools in the country.  These are available on my Department's website www.education.ie and include reporting and oversight arrangements.</p><p>  The recommended approach is for schools to aim to prevent bullying in schools and, where it does happen, to take the steps required to address the issue at local level.  There is no obligation on school authorities to report incidents of bullying to my Department and my Department does not collate data on individual bullying incidents.  My Department has supported awareness raising initiatives in relation to tackling bullying.  These include Safer Internet Day, an initiative, targeted at young people, to address internet safety issues, including cyberbullying.  I was very pleased to launch Safer Internet Day 2014 in Ireland earlier this month. </p><p>  Central to promoting safer use of the Internet by young people is a strong commitment to changing behaviour and raising the knowledge, skills and attitudes around preventing, responding to and reporting cyber bullying incidents. The continued implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying will increase capacity in these areas and build on my Department's current strategy to ensure that internet safety is mainstreamed throughout schools' teaching, learning and other practices.  Resources are available on www.webwise.ie and include guidelines on developing Acceptable Use Policies.</p><p>My Department also supported the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which took place in 2013 and will again support this initiative in March 2014.  </p><p>  An Anti-Bullying Parent Training Programme was run jointly by the National Parents Councils (primary and post primary) in 2013.  Funding of &euro;60,000 was grant aided for this purpose and 105 anti-bullying parent training sessions were delivered to 3279 participants around the country in 2013.  The sessions were designed to support parents and their children with issues of bullying and to inform them about the new Anti-bullying procedures for schools.  Implementation of these and other actions identified in the Plan will continue in 2014.</p></reply>

In November 2013 funding was made available as a once-off payment of the Minor Works Grant in respect of the 2013/2014 school year.  Future funding of the Minor Works Grant remains governed by the need to focus on the provision of additional school places and the position as I outlined in November 2011 remains in place.  I know that whenever my Department is in a position to issue a Minor Works Grant that is welcomed by school communities and management bodies as a valuable contribution to the costs of maintaining school infrastructure whether in the mainstream or special school sector.</p></reply>

This leads to an average cycle of maintenance taking place just over once every 5 years.  This work is carried out to ensure that the State's investment in the Arterial Drainage schemes continues to provide the intended benefits.  These schemes were primarily focused on facilitating an increase in agricultural output. In doing this two criteria were considered, namely, the reduction in the frequency of flooding and the increase in drainage outfall thus reducing water logging. The former tends to be the overriding criterion on larger channels while the latter tends to dictate the depth and size of the minor channels.  If maintenance is not carried out then most channels would return over a number of years to their pre-drainage state. </p><p>  It should be noted that there are many other rivers and watercourses for which the OPW does not have any maintenance responsibility.  Local Authorities have statutory responsibility for maintenance of rivers and watercourses which form part of Drainage Districts.  For other watercourses falling outside of the OPW and Local Authority areas of responsibility it is private landowners generally that have responsibility for the maintenance of these.</p><p>  The attenuation referred to relates to the reduction of the flood peak by storage of the floodwater somewhere where it will do less damage.  To do this, somewhere that is not already flooded has to be flooded or somewhere that is flooded has to be flooded to a greater depth.  On larger channels this option would therefore require that considerable areas of land would have to be flooded to a greater extent in a controlled fashion.  For example, on the Blackwater in Fermoy, 25 square kilometres of land flooded to an extra metre would have been required.  This option is examined on all of our urban flood relief schemes and is only rarely found to form part of the preferred solution, generally where the flows are relatively low and a suitable attenuation area is available. In a rural setting it is almost never beneficial to transfer the flood from one landowner to another.  Another negative that arises with storage solutions is in the area of residual risk.  When an event in excess of the design event is encountered there can be a step change in the effect on the benefiting area when the storage is exhausted and the integrity of the storage area also poses a risk as the excess flood water is stored upstream of the benefiting area.  In contrast, if the design capacity of the drained channel is exceeded it continues to confer benefit and the increase in flood is more gradual.</p><p>  It has been suggested that bogs might be used to attenuate the effects of flooding.  A recent (February 2012) study &quot;The Use of Wetlands for Flood Attenuation&quot; carried out by the Aquatic Services Unit, UCC commissioned by An Taisce, stated in its executive summary that &quot;The value of wetlands for flood attenuation is, however, often exaggerated and many wetlands in fact play only a very weak role, if at all, in attenuating floods&quot;.  It further stated that &quot;it (the influence of wetlands in reducing flood peaks) is least for large events, particularly following a long period of prior rainfall, when soil and wetland storage are saturated.&quot;</p></reply>

The maintenance and upkeep of the National Monuments is a statutory function of the Commissioners of Public Works under National Monuments legislation dating back to the 1930&rsquo;s and is undertaken by experienced conservation staff of the OPW and a network of skilled local direct labour in various locations around the country. Non National Monument sites are maintained as part of the OPW&rsquo;s broader remit for the care and management of the state property portfolio, including this heritage estate. These properties have, in many cases, direct labour force teams located at the site dealing with issues such as grounds management, horticulture / arboriculture, security, event management and a range of other tasks.</p><p>  In addition to the statutory function relating to the maintenance and upkeep of the National Monuments portfolio, the OPW is also responsible for the presentation of a number of sites to visitors. Currently, full guided visitor services are provided at 70 heritage sites each year; 24 of them presented on a fulltime basis and the remaining 46 on a seasonal basis generally within the period between April and September. Not all of these sites charge admission and a significant number are free entry. In 2013, approx 4.2m visitors were admitted to OPW sites with visitor services and a much greater number, well in excess of 15m for the entire estate, visited the unguided sites within the portfolio. The open public sites in this latter category include such properties as St Stephen's Green and the Phoenix Park in Dublin where there is a considerable public footfall. Some sites (ie: the Dublin Castle complex) have a multi-functional role operating in the case of the castle for example as both a high profile visitor location and a Conference Centre.</p><p> Since many of the sites operated by the OPW Heritage Service do not function as commercial concerns as such but rather are operated for the public good as part of the celebration of the nations&rsquo; culture and heritage, the question of turnover does not strictly arise. However, for the purposes of answering the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, I have asked my officials to capture costs relating to those sites where we either maintain a Guide Service operation or alternatively have a workforce located (ie; ground staff, event teams etc) and to set it beside details of gross admission and sales income (where such is actually charged or received) and the overall number of visitors admitted (where such records are maintained on either a paying or non-paying basis). The cost to value equation however is not completely captured by this analysis, since there is a distinct multiplier effect in evidence having regard to both the wider tourism and the general economy which benefits to a significant degree from the availability of this unique tourist and visitor resource. I would also suggest that this analysis does not identify the social and cultural benefits that flow from the presentation of the heritage estate and the very real contribution it makes to our sense of a unique and valuable cultural identity.</p><p>  The information in relation to the sites treated within the Heritage estate managed and operated by the OPW is enclosed on the tabular statement. Naturally, if the Deputy has a specific enquiry in mind which I have not addressed in this material, I will be happy to respond if he wishes to contact me directly.</p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>-</b></div></th><th><div><b>1</b></div></th><th><div><b>2</b></div></th><th><div><b>3</b></div></th><th><div><b>4</b></div></th><th><div><b>5</b></div></th><th><div><b>6</b></div></th><th><div><b>7</b></div></th><th><div><b>8</b></div></th><th><div><b>9</b></div></th><th><div><b>10</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div><b>No</b></div></td><td><div><b>Site

A decision was made immediately to install temporary flood defences along the banks of the river, with the work being done by the local authority and funded by the OPW. The Department of Social Protection also came to the immediate assistance of the people affected through its Humanitarian Assistance Scheme.</p><p>  In relation to the longer term solution, at a meeting which the Minister for Finance and I attended that day with officials from Limerick City Council, various options for addressing the situation were considered.  One option which was discussed was that the provision of permanent flood defences to protect the vulnerable areas of King's Island would be incorporated into the Regeneration Project for the area with technical advice and funding for the flood defence work to be provided by the OPW.  This approach would ensure that the timescales for the flood defence plans and the Regeneration Project were fully integrated and would facilitate a properly coherent approach to the redevelopment and protection of the area.</p><p>  Limerick City Council is the lead authority for the planning and advancement of the Regeneration Project for the St Mary's Park/Kings Island area and it would have more details on the current status of and timelines for the project.</p></reply>

Maintenance and upkeep of these National Monuments is a statutory function of the Commissioners of Public Works under National Monuments legislation dating back to the 1930&rsquo;s and is undertaken by experienced OPW architectural conservation staff and a network of skilled local direct labour based at 6 Depot locations around the country. In addition to the statutory function relating to the maintenance and upkeep of the National Monuments portfolio, the OPW is also responsible for the presentation of a number of sites to visitors. Currently, full guided visitor services are provided at 70 heritage sites each year; 24 of them presented on a fulltime basis and the remaining 46 on a seasonal basis generally within the period between April and September. In 2013, approx 4.2m visitors were admitted to these sites and a much greater number, perhaps in excess of 10m, visited the unattended sites within the entire estate.  </p><p>  As is apparent from the foregoing, maintenance of the National Monuments portfolio and the delivery of visitor services at even a relatively limited number of heritage sites is a considerable undertaking. Clearly, given the scale of this operation and bearing in mind the difficulties being experienced by the Exchequer in recent times, it has been incumbent on the OPW to examine the heritage portfolio in the same way as every other part of its responsibility and consider whether this service can be delivered more efficiently and with greater economy on behalf of the taxpayer. OPW is therefore considering a range of measures including outsourcing of non-core elements to private sector contractors. There are a range of functions such as maintenance and upkeep of modern visitor buildings for example that need not be performed by skilled National Monuments staff and which should therefore be done by others and arrangements are being made, where appropriate, to ensure that this happens.</p><p>  The impact of the various measures that are being considered will be assessed relative to a number of key criteria including more efficient use of scarce skilled staff resources, financial economy and, perhaps most critically, whether there is a potential impact on the statutory function assigned to the Commissioners of Public Works for the maintenance and upkeep of the National Monument portfolio. The measures will also have regard to staff employed by the OPW and none of the initiatives being contemplated currently will involve the displacement of any serving staff.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government committed to giving the Comptroller and Auditor General extra powers to carry out value-for-money (VFM) audits of State programmes.  A number of meetings have been held between my Department and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to discuss that proposal in the context of the overall mandate of the Comptroller and Auditor General, including the VFM, financial reporting and inspection mandates.</p><p>  Any consideration of the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General must take account of initiatives for the management and reporting of public expenditure. This includes, for example, as part of the annual estimates process, the introduction and development of performance budgeting. Relevant developments at EU level include the introduction of common standards for the accounts of public bodies, while, as part of a joint initiative with the Department of Finance, recommendations made in a recent IMF Report on enhanced fiscal transparency are under consideration. Other significant developments include the consultation process currently underway on civil service accountability and performance.</p><p>  The strengthening of accountability systems requires a clear sighted examination of the forms and structures of accountability that best support the broader agenda of public service reform and its core objective of high quality and more efficient provision of public services. This wider accountability framework includes the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of both financial auditing and value for money reports. </p><p>  The Programme for Government commitments and associated reform proposals, including those relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General,  focus on enhancing  performance and accountability arrangements so that the public service can be empowered to be more effective and to demonstrate that well informed choices are being made as to how public money is spent.</p></reply>

Following receipt of the reports from local authorities the Department submitted a Report to Government on the overall position on storm damage.  Based on this Report the Government decided to allocate up to &euro;70 million funding to repair the damage, of which up to &euro;20 million relates to damage to coastal protection infrastructure.  </p><p>  The Office of Public Works wrote on 10 January 2014 to City and County Managers in coastal areas indicating that it will accept applications under the Minor Works Scheme for funding to assist with repairs to built flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms. This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre-storm condition. The specific application form for this entitled Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014 is available on www.opw.ie under Flood Risk Management.  Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by local authorities.  </p><p>  The question of the most appropriate form of coastal protection in any location, including rock armour type structures, is a matter for consideration by the relevant local authority in the first instance. In areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage to or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding,  appropriate and sustainable measures should be identified by local authorities to protect those assets.  Where intervention measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, these may implemented subject to the availability of resources.  OPW's ongoing Catchment Flood Risk Management (CFRAM) study is addressing flood risk, including coastal flood risk, on a nationwide scale.  Flood maps will be available later this year to include 90 at risk coastal areas and flood risk management plans with preferred options for dealing with flood risk for these areas are to be available in 2015.</p></reply>

The new Plan outlines the key reform initiatives that will be implemented over the next three years.  It also addresses the broader ambition for reform towards 2020.  The four key themes running through this new Reform Plan are delivery of improved outcomes; utilisation of the reform dividend; digitalisation and open data; and openness and accountability.</p><p>  While maintaining the drive for increased efficiency, this next phase of reform will have a greater focus on the delivery of improved outcomes for service users.  This will include greater use of alternative models of service delivery, such as commissioning for specific outcomes, and service delivery improvements at sectoral and organisational levels.</p><p>  As well as changing how we deliver public services, we will continue to focus on increasing efficiency and productivity.  As efficiencies are realised through initiatives such as public procurement reform and shared services, some of the savings made will be re-invested in improved services.  This &quot;Reform Dividend&quot; will serve to underpin and help sustain the reform agenda beyond the current fiscal crisis.</p><p>  The Public Service must make maximum use of new technologies, digitalisation and open data to deliver services in innovative ways.  A new Government ICT Strategy will be published later this year that will address the use of new and emerging technologies, ensuring that eGovernment is designed around real needs and taking steps to improve the take-up of 'digital government'.  As part of this new strategy, we are capturing data on the top transactional services on which the citizen engages with the State, which will help inform what further services will be put online.</p><p>  The new plan also places a focus on increased openness, transparency and accountability.  Citizens must be able to clearly see that the Public Service is working fairly in its decision making, in implementing policy and in delivering public services.  In this context, the political reform programme will deliver greater openness, transparency and accountability to strengthen trust in government and public services and strengthen public governance.  A particularly important development is the recent publication of a consultation paper focused on options for strengthening Civil Service accountability and performance.</p><p>  Last month, I also published a report setting out the considerable progress that has been made in reforming the Public Service since our first Reform Plan was published in 2011.  To provide just some examples:</p><p>- We are implementing a radical overhaul of our approach to public procurement, with the new Office of Government Procurement targeting savings of &euro;500 million over the next three years;</p><p>- Peoplepoint, the Civil Service wide Human Resources and Pensions Shared Services Centre, has been operational since March last year.  It now services over 24,000 employees across 19 organisations.  When it becomes fully operational in January 2015, it will provide services to 40 organisations with estimated savings of &euro;12.5 million annually;</p><p>- An Action Plan to deliver efficiencies in the State's extensive property portfolio is currently being implemented;</p><p>- We have issued over 500,000 Public Services Cards.  The Cards are currently being used for social welfare payments and the free travel scheme, and we are considering extension of the Card to cover a greater range of services;</p><p>- The Office of Government Chief Information Officer has been established within my Department to maximise the potential benefits of digitalisation in delivering services and information;</p><p>- The Government services portal -  - now includes quick links to more than 400 information and transaction services;</p><p>- A series of public expenditure reforms have been implemented to bring greater structure, scrutiny and openness to budgeting;</p><p>- We are making good progress in implementing our programme of political and legislative reform, aimed at enhancing openness, transparency and accountability; and</p><p>- The Haddington Road Agreement, which came into effect on 1 July, 2013, is a key enabler of the reform programme and will deliver an additional &euro;1 billion reduction in the cost of the Public Service pay and pensions bill by 2016.  The Agreement also provides for a total of 15 million additional working hours annually across all sectors of the Public Service.</p><p>  The full Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 and the Progress Report can be seen at .</p></reply>

The commencement of operations on this date however is contingent on OPW maintenance staff being able to access the site for a sufficient period prior to this in order to perform essential maintenance, safety preparation and winter debris clearance tasks in order to render the site fit to receive visitors safely. If OPW staff is unable to reach the Island in a timely way to perform these tasks, or if it is delayed in its completion by adverse weather, the proposed opening date may not be feasible. However, in line with its general policy of facilitating the greatest possible access to the Monument, the OPW will commit to do all possible to achieve this date. As is normal, the precise opening date will be publicised locally in the media and on  when it has been finally determined.</p></reply>

A further review, again carried out by Hay Consultants, was undertaken and implemented in 2007.</p><p>  In June, 2011 this Government as part of the implementation of pay ceilings for Senior Public Sector posts made significant changes to the payment arrangements for Chief Executive Officers in Commercial State Bodies.  The salary ranges that apply to newly appointed CEO s in Commercial State Companies were reduced subject to a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 per annum (subject to limited exceptions)  which has the effect of both reducing the salary for all CEOs in a proportionate manner while maintaining the  weightings  which reflect the different scale and responsibilities associated with the individual posts.  </p><p>  While the chief executive is employed by the relevant organisation, it is a standard statutory requirement that contract terms for CEO s of Commercial State Bodies are subject to the approval of the relevant line Minister given with my consent as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>  There are no Commercial State Bodies under the aegis of my Department and I understand the question has been copied to other Departments for direct reply.</p></reply>

This is part of the overall amount of up to &euro;70m which the Government has decided to make available towards the cost of damage to all public infrastructure and amenities.  The funding in respect of repair of damaged coastal defences will be made available through the Office of Public Works Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.</p><p>  Most of the damage caused by the New Year storms was to public infrastructure in coastal areas including piers, roads, car parks and coastal protection structures such as sea walls, embankments etc..  The Government decided that to respond effectively to the needs of the local communities most affected by the severe storms it would provide financial assistance to the relevant local authorities to facilitate them in immediately carrying out of a programme of prioritised repair and remediation works to assist the communities worst affected especially those in areas relying on the tourism industry.  It is a matter for the local authorities to identify and address the priority areas and structures for which funding is to be sought. Any works undertaken by the local authorities on repairing coastal defence infrastructure will ensure that the protection afforded to homes, businesses and lands by those defence structures is restored to its pre-storms level.</p><p>  Financial assistance is not available from the OPW to property owners in relation to individual property protection.</p><p>  The OPW is satisfied that the position on the basis of financial assistance to be provided to local authorities in respect of storm damage was set out clearly in its letter of 10 January 2014 to the local authorities.</p></reply>

The CEBs support the indigenous micro- enterprise sector (less than ten employees) in the start- up and expansion phases and stimulate enterprise potential at local level. They are the first point of call in terms of advice, direction, training and grant support for anyone who wishes to start a business. Contact details for the CEBs are available on .  CEBs can also refer clients to other appropriate agencies, for example Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  The CEBs generally only provide grants to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. Retail enterprises (where franchise opportunities mainly exist) are ineligible for direct financial support from CEBs due to concerns over displacement as grant- assisted projects may simply displace business from other players in the local market.</p><p>  However, any start- up can use the CEBs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start- up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local CEB.</p><p>  Further, anyone interested in availing of franchising as a business option could benefit from participating in the CEB non-financial or &quot;soft&quot; support programmes. All locally trading businesses, including start- ups, can avail of non-financial assistance from their CEB in the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives, etc. Training courses include such topics as start-your-own-business (SYOB), taxation for beginners, internet marketing, ideas generation and negotiation skills. Indeed the SYOB course would cover the key issues in starting a business and would complement the information that would be provided by the franchisor. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises is being reformed and the 35 existing County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will be dissolved and new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be created. This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth. The target date for the legal dissolution of the CEBs and the formal launch of the LEOs is mid-April, 2014.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client base comprises four main categories: Manufacturing and internationally traded services companies employing ten or more people (with a focus on exporting or with the potential to export); Innovation-led start-ups with the potential to grow on international markets and; Irish food companies - both those home-grown in Ireland, and those that are overseas owned or controlled.</p><p>  However, as companies seeking franchise opportunities are primarily local market focused and seeking to become a franchisee of some international or national offerings in the local area, and as such would not be potential clients of Enterprise Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-25a.712.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022500064#WRM02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 371, 376 and 382 together.</p><p>  At present, welfare clients who are paid through the post office network are paid in cash. It gives rise to a distribution of some &euro;9.5 billion in cash annually.  Some nine hundred thousand (900,000) clients of the Department are paid in this manner, accounting for some fifty per cent (50%) of all welfare payments. On foot of a new contract signed by me a little more than two months ago, the contract for these services will generate sums in excess of &euro;50 million in revenue to An Post in the coming year.  This contract is quite clearly substantial in terms of reach, value and impact.  </p><p>  However, cash payments are an inherently expensive means of paying clients.  It costs the Department six and a half times more to issue a payment to a customer in cash than it does by EFT.  Almost sixteen per cent (16%) of the Department&rsquo;s budget for administration is being spent on the costs associated with delivering payments to welfare clients. This approach requires ongoing review.</p><p>  Consumer behaviour now shows a very high movement towards online and electronic payments.  Electronic point-of-sale transactions increased by approximately 20% year on year in 2013. The number of point-of-sale terminals in now heading towards 60,000 with approximately one in six of these offering &ldquo;contactless&rdquo; payment facilities. Last year some 300 million transactions were made with payment cards.  Some 21 million journeys were made using Leap cards in 2013. Consumers generally, including the vast majority of our clients, are increasingly adept and willing to adopt electronic payment approaches as a matter of convenience. In keeping with these behavioural shifts, my Department must look for opportunities to keep abreast of societal changes, provide better and more secure customer service, while also continuing to serve those who are more vulnerable in our society.   </p><p>  Many of our customers while having a bank account, credit union account or other account in a financial institution which can receive electronic payments are still being paid in cash.  This is a costly choice for us to support, particularly when budgets at a national level remain so constrained.  </p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has developed a Payments Strategy. The overall objective of this Strategy, which was approved by the Government last year, is to modernise the Department&rsquo;s payment delivery approach by delivering payments to clients electronically and in a way that facilitates onward e-payments by the client.  In recognising this movement towards the electronic handling of payments, the Strategy lays out a road map for a progressive movement towards increased use of electronic channels in the disbursement of welfare payments. This road map adopts a phased approach to implementation. The progression to electronic payments is a critical element of the wider National Payments Plan aimed at removing the very high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy which will contribute to improved national competitiveness.  The Strategy supports wider Government objectives for increased efficiency in public services and better services to customers that suit changing behaviours, while also increasing levels of financial inclusion among the Department&rsquo;s clients. I must reiterate however that I have consistently confirmed that no customer will be left without a payment simply by virtue of not being able to receive it electronically.</p><p>  I am conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, notably the extent to which it is now a one stop shop where people can pay bills, purchase mobile phone top ups, use the passport application facility, pay local property tax or garda fines, and carry out a range of banking and other financial services.  The Government has stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network in the Programme for Government.  However, I am also aware that the business risks facing An Post cannot be placed solely on the door step of proposed changes to welfare payments. The Deputies may be interested to know that over the past ten years, the number of post office outlets countrywide has fallen by one third.  Over this same period, mostly due to the downturn experienced in the economy generally, the volume of welfare payments routed through the post offices rose by seven per cent (7%).  This increased transaction volume has derived significant additional revenues to An Post and the postmasters.  And still, despite increased transaction numbers, the post offices numbers fell to levels which are now about two thirds of what they were a decade ago.</p><p>  Undeniably a loss in the current revenue stream from social welfare payments would impact on An Post. I understand that in anticipation of the increasing use of EFT generally, An Post has prepared and implemented a strategy which aims to address the reality of increased use of electronic payment methods within the economy. On the revenue side, An Post has made significant progress in developing new commercial opportunities with other financial and payments institutions, notably with AIB and Aviva.  New lines of business have been generated such as foreign exchange where An Post now holds 30% of the domestic foreign exchange business. </p><p>  I know that my colleague Minister Rabbitte is working closely with the Board of An Post in identifying new retail business opportunities for their network.  He has consistently repeated his support for the continuing modernisation of post office services and has again just last week spoken of the need for them to compete and win new business that brings benefits to postmasters and communities locally. For my part, I was very happy to back that support with the signing of the contract with An Post in December last for a period of two years with the potential to extend the contractual arrangement for a further four years thereafter. It is important that An Post and postmasters alike replicate this success and continue to work together to maintain financial services in local communities.</p></reply>

The programme is funded by the Department with day-to-day management of contracts undertaken by Pobal.  Some 425 not-for-profit companies and co-operatives shared annual funding of &euro;46m from the programme in 2013.  Contract holders must deliver tangible services that are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising and other public funds.  The programme is not intended to represent full-funding for any operation.  Funding is provided on the basis of a contribution to the cost of a full-time position to support the delivery of the service and includes management and non-management positions.  The contribution to a management position is &euro;32,000 per annum and &euro;19,033 to a non-management position.  The Department may also provide additional financial support where revenue earning opportunities are limited, to support the development or transition of a service provider and/or to meet other short-lived cash flow shortfalls.</p><p>  The programme supported around 2,900 people in the delivery of services during 2013.  In addition, the Department estimates that between 300 and 400 additional people are engaged by contractors.  The following table gives the number of people employed in positions to which the CSP contributes at 31 June 2013.  A number of contractors (involving less than 50 full-time equivalent positions) transferred from the programme to the National Transport Authority at the end of 2013.  Taking this adjustment into account, I expect that similar level of employment can be maintained for 2014.  The Department has no plans for any significant change in the delivery of the CSP.<table><tr><th><b>Staff employed in CSP supported positions at 30 June

In order for an application from a host organisation to be approved the host organisation must meet a number of criteria. These criteria are designed to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position, that it provides appropriate training and development experience to the intern, and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.  In addition a standard agreement must be signed and agreed to by both the intern and the host organisation.  This agreement clearly states the terms of the internship, including the expected working hours, which can range from 30 &ndash; 40 hours (maximum) per week, and the specific learning outcomes the intern can expect to gain over the course of the internship.</p><p>  To ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection routinely monitors internships.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the use of random monitoring site visits during which discussions are held with both parties to the internship.  In this regard, over 4,400 on-site monitoring visits have been conducted to-date . As part of this process 98% of internships were found to  conform to the requirements of the JobBridge scheme.  Remedial action is taken in cases of non-compliance. </p><p>  It is worth noting that participation in the scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge team at any stage of their internship for advice and support.  In addition any individual, whether or not involved in an internship, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&rsquo;s criteria or that a host organisation is abusing the scheme may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are investigated.</p><p>  An independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns progress to paid employment within 5 months of completing their internship.</p></reply>

The programme is funded by the Department with day-to-day management of contracts undertaken by Pobal.  Some 425 not-for-profit companies and co-operatives shared annual funding of &euro;46m from the programme in 2013.  Contract holders must deliver tangible services that are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and/or fundraising and other public funds.  The programme is not intended to represent full-funding for any operation.</p><p>  Each contract holder is responsible for their own budgets, income, financial and other liabilities.  Contracts are generally offered on a three-year cycle based on a business plan or similar submitted by the company.  Continued funding is subject to satisfactory compliance with the programme&rsquo;s operational requirements, financial position of the company, continued eligibility of the company and service, progress on delivery of the stated objectives in the business plan, and an assessment of a business plan for the following three year contact cycle.  A regular review process is undertaken to ensure compliance with contract obligations, audit issues, continuing capacity of the organisation to manage public funds, the need for and quality of service delivery, sustainability, and value for money.</p><p>  A re-contracting process for the period 2014-16 for organisations operating under the Community Services Strand of the programme was undertaken in 2013.  This involved the submission of business plans by contracted organisations.  These business plans and past performance were reviewed by Pobal and the conclusions submitted to the Department for consideration and decision.  The business plan and operations of the company referred to by the Deputy was reviewed under this process.  The company in question was approved for a funding contribution for one full-time manager post and four full-time equivalent posts (FTE) up to end of 2013 with a total value of &euro;108,132 pa.  The business plan submitted by the company as part of the 2014-16 review process was considered to have limitations including the demonstrated level of activity for the level of funds granted.  The level of output delivered by the company was considered low when compared with similar services.  </p><p>  The Department is concerned about the value for money being delivered for the high level of public funds provided to the company.  Overall, the total service users of 136 are far below the average of 3,229 for the sector. The Department made a decision to withdraw funding from June 2014 as funding did not represent a good or appropriate use of public funds.  The company has been offered an opportunity to seek a review of the decisions made.</p></reply>

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. These changes were provided for in legislation.</p><p>  Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6 April 1988.  This provides cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows/widowers pension (contributory). Self-employed people who pay class S PRSI contributions did not qualify for State pension (transition), and accordingly pay a reduced rate of contribution.</p><p>  The State pension is a very valuable asset and it is important, therefore, that those who claim a State pension have paid sufficient PRSI contributions over a working life to benefit from State pension.   The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that self-employed persons enjoy greater value from the payment of social insurance than employed persons, in particular, due to the lower rate of PRSI paid.</p></reply>

These reforms, which were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, are predicated on activation and on facilitating lone parents back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age. </p><p>  The table below indicates the number of recipients who lost their entitlement to the OFP payment as a result of the age reforms to the OFP scheme in both 2012 and 2013.  The table also estimates the number of recipients, based on the current profile of OFP recipients, who may be expected to exit the scheme as a result of the further age reforms in both 2014 and 2015.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Number of OFP recipients affected</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1,009</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>8,185</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (estimated)</td><td>9,190</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (estimated)</td><td>41,158</td></tr></table></p><p>  The Government is committed to supporting one-parent families who pro-actively engage with the Department&rsquo;s work activation process to become economically independent.  A wide range of supports and services are presently available to lone parents who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment as a result of the reforms to the OFP scheme.</p><p>  In advance of the OFP scheme age reforms in July 2013, I introduced a number of measures aimed at easing the transition of affected lone parents to other social welfare income support payments.  These included the re-rating of existing carer&rsquo;s allowance and family income supplement (FIS) claims and the fast-tracking of new applications for the FIS, carer&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments.</p><p>  In addition, last year, in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2013, I introduced the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) transitional arrangement, which caters for OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment, who have a youngest child aged under 14 years, and who are entitled to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment.  These customers are now exempt from the JA criteria that require them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They can work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA  payment &ndash; subject to a means test.  They also have access to the Department&rsquo;s activation related supports to enable them to become job-ready and/or to find employment.  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until a recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  At this point, should they continue to claim the JA payment, they will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.</p><p>  From an operational perspective, letters were issued to all customers whose claims were due to finish in July, 2013.  Depending on the local circumstances, customers were either invited to information seminars held locally, or to one-to-one meetings, to advise them of their possible entitlements to other social welfare income support payments.  Relevant application forms were issued at these information seminars/one-to-one meetings to ensure that payments were not delayed.  The communication included a Public Services Office phone number based in Sligo that took all calls relating to the ending of claims.  OFP customers in receipt of either the FIS payment or the carer&rsquo;s allowance received centrally-issued letters &ndash; and their entitlement was reviewed automatically by these scheme areas.  </p><p>  My officials are currently making the necessary preparations in advance of the next phase of the OFP scheme age reforms &ndash; which are due to take place in July, 2014.  These preparations will aim to ensure that lone parents who will be affected by these reforms will continue to have their transition eased to other social welfare income support payments.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 79,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Department has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  </p><p>  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households. The minimum contribution for coupled households was &euro;35 per week during 2012 and 2013. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs. </p><p>  Details of the total contributions made by rent supplement recipients towards their accommodation costs are not available.</p></reply>

In addition, the 2011 Jobs Initiative measure reducing, for a defined period, the Employer Lower rate of PRSI, expired as planned at the beginning of this year.</p><p>  Overall SIF expenditure in 2014 will also be lower as a result of measures announced in Budget 2014 and in previous years. These decreases are partially offset by demographic pressures arising from increased numbers of pensioners. These demographic pressures will continue to pose a significant SIF financing challenge in the years ahead.</p></reply>

Typically, these would include the employer:</p><p>  -notifying the trustees of its intention to stop contributions to the scheme</p><p>  -failing to make contributions due to the scheme within a specified period</p><p>-going into liquidation</p><p>-being bought by another company and that company deciding not to continue to operate the previous employer&rsquo;s pension scheme.</p><p>  Any decision by the trustees to wind up a scheme would be supported by the trust deed and rules of the scheme which I understand can be challenged under trust law.</p><p>  In the event of a decision to wind up a pension scheme the trustees of the scheme are required to notify the Pensions Board, all members and the authorised trade unions of their decision as soon as possible but in any event not later than 12 weeks after the decision is made.  Where a trustee fails to meet his/her obligations in this regard the trustee will be guilty of an offence under the Pensions Act.</p><p>  Section 48 of the Pensions Act set out the order under which the assets of a pension scheme must be distributed in the event of the wind up of a scheme. The Pensions Act does not set down a timeframe for the wind up of a scheme.</p><p>  The Pensions Ombudsman can investigate and determine matters of maladministration by those responsible for the management of a pension scheme. He can also investigate disputes of fact or law with trustees or managers or employers concerning a pension scheme. The time limits within which a complaint or dispute must be brought to the Pensions Ombudsman are six years from the date of the act giving rise to the complaint or dispute, or three years from the date on which the person became aware or ought to have become aware of the act giving rise to the complaint or dispute, whichever is the earlier, or such longer period as the Pensions Ombudsman may allow if it appears to him that there are reasonable grounds for extending the period and it would be just and reasonable to do so.</p></reply>

I am very aware of the serious challenges facing many pension schemes at this time and the efforts being made by both the trustees and the sponsoring employers of these scheme to meet these challenges. You will be aware that I have introduced a number of legislative changes in recent years to assist both trustees and employers meet these challenges.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Pensions Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme in any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits. Prior to this change, the trustees of a pension scheme could restructure active and deferred scheme member&rsquo;s benefits and post retirement increases in pension benefits. The change to section 50 of the Pensions Act extends the categories of benefits which can be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits to include a portion of pensioner benefits. This change essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members. </p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board. This guidance makes provision for the notification of all scheme members in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits. In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits. </p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries. </p><p>  In relation to the matter of representation by deferred scheme members in consideration of a change to scheme benefits, this is a matter which needs to be considered in a broader industrial relations context. I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in this regard.</p></reply>

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the CWS.  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to unemployed people.  The Department is intensifying its level of engagement with the unemployed, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.  The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country. </p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location.  Where the community welfare service has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.</p><p>  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased. Improved phone services have been put in place, allowing in many cases, for customer queries to be processed without having to attend a clinic on a face to face basis. If a person is unable to travel to a clinic, for example due to illness, alternative arrangements are in place including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home if necessary.</p><p>  People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement, which are usually reviewed once to twice yearly.</p><p>  A full listing of the CWS locations by county, including postcodes for Dublin, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at the following link </p><p>  In terms of further re-structuring of CWS clinics during 2014, the Department is continuously reviewing the staffing needs for all areas of its business, to ensure that the best use is made of available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society. </p></reply>

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in levels of work.  </p><p>  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years. </p><p>  In addition, employees in the fishing industry who suffer a loss of employment may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance subject to normal scheme criteria which includes being available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.</p><p>  It may also be noted that if a person has no income they may be entitled to the basic supplementary welfare allowance. If weekly income is below the supplementary welfare allowance rate for their family size, a payment may be made to bring their income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate. Also exceptional needs payments may help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.</p><p>  Any changes to these provisions would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding. </p><p>The humanitarian assistance scheme, which is income tested, is available to assist people whose homes were damaged by the recent severe weather and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair as a result of the damage.  The objective of the income test is to determine the household&rsquo;s capacity to meet the costs of restoring their home to a habitable condition by considering all household income, including that derived from capital, when determining entitlement to payment. For example, a family consisting of a couple and two children with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application. For each whole &euro;1,000 of household income above the &euro;70,000 the couple will be required to make a personal contribution of 1% toward the amount allowable. The amount allowable in any particular case refers to the amount the officer administering the scheme determines is required to replace essential losses and to make any essential repairs. Further detail on the humanitarian assistance scheme and the income test for single persons and families is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at   .</p><p>  In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:</p><p>  -  Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially with payments around the country ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;500 depending on family size. The response on the ground to the current flooding had been primarily focused at this stage with immediate payments issuing mainly in respect of food, clothing, toiletries and accommodation.</p><p>  -  Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.  In the last week, applications have started to be processed under this phase in Limerick in respect of white goods, furniture, etc. with payments ranging from &euro;2,000 to &euro;4,000.  Payments under this phase are normally processed within 2 to 3 working days of the receipt of a valid application and supporting documentation.</p><p>  -  Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required.  It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental/Agency response.  Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.  Payments under this phase will generally take longer to process as homeowners establish the cost of repair by securing builders&rsquo; estimates and the extent of the loss is verified, usually by a loss assessor, in cases where significant amounts are claimed.</p><p>  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted. The information available shows that in response to previous flooding events, payments have issued to individuals ranging from approximately &euro;50 to &euro;28,000 under this scheme. </p><p>As of 21<sup>st</sup>   February 2014, some &euro;206,000 financial assistance under the humanitarian assistance scheme has been paid in respect of 405 claims, of which 323 were in respect of the Limerick area. The average payment made in 2014 is &euro;508 per claim which in most cases relates to the stage 1 phase of emergency income support. It is envisaged that more substantial payments will be made as the number of applications increase in respect of stages 2 and 3 as outlined above. Details of the payments made under the scheme on a county basis in 2014 are provided in the attached tabular statement. </p><p>  Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the recent weather events should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement:</b><b>Humanitarian Assistance payments 2014 (as of 21</b><b><sup>st</sup></b><b> February)</b><table><tr><th>COUNTY</th><th>No of Payments</th><th>Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>323</td><td>&euro;149,314</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>26</td><td>&euro;27,021</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>12</td><td>&euro;7,582</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN </td><td>2</td><td>&euro;6,955</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>9</td><td>&euro;3,095</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>9</td><td>&euro;3,008</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;2,250</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>6</td><td>&euro;1,750</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>5</td><td>&euro;1,700</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>5</td><td>&euro;770</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;674</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>3</td><td>&euro;602</td></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;300</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>405</td><td>&euro;206,020</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by this Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects. </p><p>  The Government has provided &euro;37 million for the programme in 2014 which will benefit over 205,000 children across some 1,600 schools and organisations, representing an average of &euro;23,000 per school/organisation and &euro;180 per child for the academic year. </p><p>  In recent years priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills initiative for disadvantaged schools &rdquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rdquo;(DEIS).  DEIS schools may apply for funding for all pupils, if they feel such a need exists.  However there is no automatic entitlement to funding and all applications must be considered in light of the available budget for the scheme. Following the provision of an additional &euro;2 million for the scheme as part of Budget 2013 the Department contacted over 170 schools requesting expressions of interest in participating in the scheme for the current school year. Applications to join the scheme were received from some 90 schools which have been included in the scheme.  </p></reply>

The nomination process is initiated by the State authorities drawing up a Tentative List of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries.  A particular criterion is that a site must be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &ldquo;<i>cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.</i>&rdquo;   Following a public consultation process and consideration by an expert advisory group, a new Tentative List for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010.  &ldquo;The Royal Sites of Ireland&rdquo;, made up of Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, the Rathcroghan Complex, the Tara Complex and the Hill of Uisneach, was one of seven potential nominations chosen for inclusion in Ireland&rsquo;s Tentative List.  Consideration is also being given at this stage, in consultation with Armagh City and District Council and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, to the possibility of adding Eamhain Mhacha/Navan Fort in Co. Armagh to the Royal Sites proposal.</p><p>  The nomination of a property to the World Heritage List is a significant undertaking that requires the development of comprehensive nomination documentation, including a management plan for the property.  Following submission of a nomination to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies:</p><p>- the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS);</p><p>- the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); and</p><p>- the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property(ICCROM).</p><p>  Once the site has been evaluated, the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee makes the final decision regarding the site&rsquo;s inclusion on the World Heritage List.  </p><p>  In order to further progress the nomination process, I hosted a seminar in September 2013 to consider the extent of local interest in pursuing World Heritage nomination for the sites on the current Tentative List and to clarify all the elements involved in applying for and retaining such status.  My Department has been in on-going contact with relevant local authorities and community representatives since the seminar to further clarify the significant research and other requirements involved in preparing nomination documentation. As part of this process a further meeting will take place shortly with representatives from the areas in the Royal Sites nomination, including the Hill of Uisneach. </p></reply>

In April 2013, a report commissioned by INT on the hull condition of the vessel highlighted serious safety concerns. Based on the report&rsquo;s findings, INT issued a &lsquo;<i>Notice to Vacate</i>&rsquo; to both of the businesses that had been operating from the vessel.    The Deputy will also be aware that Waterways Ireland offered to arrange for the removal and disposal of the ship on INT's behalf. Waterways Ireland made this offer as the property owners of the Grand Canal Dock because of the health and safety concerns arising from the condition of the vessel and because INT did not have the financial resources to deal with the matter. I am advised that INT accepted the offer and confirmed its approval to Waterways Ireland to dispose of the vessel on its behalf. </p><p>  A commitment was given in the D&aacute;il on Thursday 13 February 2014 that a meeting would be sought to enable the relevant bodies with an interest in this mater, including my own Department and Waterways Ireland, to determine if anything could be done to avert the disposal of the Naomh &Eacute;anna.  This meeting took place on the following Tuesday, 18 February, and included officials from my Department, Waterways Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority (HSA).  The Marine Survey Office, Dublin City Council, Dublin Port Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency were also invited but were not in a position to send representatives.   </p><p>  The meeting concluded that the proper course of action to be taken was to proceed with the disposal of the vessel because of the continuing serious risk it posed, the disruption and expense that would be involved were it to sink in the Grand Canal and the absence of any firm indication that the very significant level finance required to make it safe and insurable was potentially available.<i></i>This decision was not taken<i></i>  lightly. </p><p>  I am advised that a contractor moved the Naomh &Eacute;anna into dry dock at Ringsend on Wednesday 19 February 2014 and that the contractor will commence disposal following the safe removal of asbestos from the vessel, which it is anticipated could take up to three weeks.</p></reply>

I have stated on a number of occasions that transparency in the development of the framework is crucial and that the views of local communities must be at the heart of the transition to renewable energy. </p><p>  The Stage 1 consultation, which involved the publication of Stage 1 information and summary documents, ran from 23 October to 22 November last year, and gave all interested parties an opportunity, at the outset, to present their views on how we should develop national policy to realise the opportunity to trade renewable energy with other EU Member States and, in the first instance, with the United Kingdom. My Department received nearly 1,400 responses to the consultation across a range of sectors all of which are available on my Department's website. My Department is now in the process of assessing the responses to inform the development of the framework.</p><p>  In order to complete Stage 1 of the development of the framework, taking into account the feedback received, my Department will now prepare the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) scoping report. The process will then move to Stage 2 with the publication of the scoping report for public consultation by the end of March. National press advertisements and updates on my Department's website will inform all stakeholders of the commencement of the Stage 2 consultation. During Stage 2 a report on the Stage 1 consultation will also be published providing an overview of the consultation process, feedback and analysis. </p><p>During Stage 3 the draft policy, the Environmental Report (on which the Strategic Environmental Assessment will be based) and Natura Impact Statement (on which the Appropriate Assessment will be based) will all be published and a public consultation will provide all stakeholders a further opportunity to contribute to or make observations on the development of the framework.   </p></reply>

The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is responsible for acquiring and managing the bulk of Ireland&rsquo;s emergency oil stocks. </p><p>  Since 2007, in line with IEA and Government policy, NORA has been pursuing a policy of reducing dependency on stock tickets (paper contracts to deliver oil in an emergency) as well as repatriating stocks held abroad to the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations. In 2006, 51% of NORA stocks were held in Ireland, 10% were held as physical stocks abroad, while 40% were held as stock tickets. By 2013, the picture had changed dramatically with 73% of NORA emergency stocks held as physical stocks on the island of Ireland and 27% held as physical stocks in other EU Member States under Bilateral Agreements or Memoranda of Understanding, with no requirement for stock tickets.</p><p>  By successfully rebalancing its stocks in favour of physical stocks on the island of Ireland, NORA helps ensure that emergency stocks are easily physically accessible and available in an emergency situation. This significantly enhances the security of Irish oil supply and is in line with EU requirements under the new Oil Stocks Directive (2009/119/EC). The EU has also encouraged Member States to reduce dependency on stock tickets. </p><p>  The stocks included in the &ldquo;Island of Ireland&rdquo; figures above include NORA stocks in Northern Ireland, which amount to approximately 9% of Ireland&rsquo;s emergency stocks. Since 2011, NORA has completed three key storage refurbishment projects at Ringsend (Dublin), Kilroot (Antrim) and Tarbert (Kerry.) These storage developments form a key part of NORA&rsquo;s ongoing plans for the steady rebalancing of stocks from abroad onto the island of Ireland. </p><p>NORA has maximised its storage in all available storage facilities in Ireland, and has steadily increased its stockholding to meet its ongoing obligations. NORA is continuing on its quest to develop further storage on the island of Ireland, and a number of options are being considered. This work will continue with a view to identifying and implementing the most beneficial plans for NORA in meeting its obligations in future years and underpinning security of supply.  </p></reply>

Legislation in place reflects this policy objective and provides the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) with responsibility for regulating the activities of natural gas undertakings and gas installers (both natural gas and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG)) with respect to safety. The CER discharges its safety responsibilities through the implementation of the Gas Safety Framework, which has been in operation since 2008. The CER is currently reviewing the Gas Safety Framework with a view to extending the Framework to provide for LPG safety licensing of LPG Distribution Networks to multiple domestic final customers from the 30<sup>th</sup> April 2014 and for LPG incident reporting from the 31<sup>st</sup>   March 2014.</p><p>Natural Gas undertakings (and LPG Undertakings from the 31<sup>st</sup>   March 2014) have statutory responsibilities for the reporting of gas related incidents to the CER. Procedures have been developed by the CER to ensure that all relevant personnel deal with an incident in an effective and approved manner. </p><p>  The Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, confers on the CER specific functions in regard to gas safety. A gas installer is required to be registered as a Registered Gas Installer (RGI) in order to carry out works on domestic type gas appliances, i.e. &lsquo;Gas Works&rsquo;, as defined in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Gas Works) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 255/2009) and the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Liquefied Petroleum Gas Works) Regulation 2011 (S.I. 299/2011). As such it is a legal requirement that any &lsquo;Gas Works&rsquo; carried out in the domestic environment, whether it is the installation, service or repair of a gas appliance, must always be carried out by a RGI. </p><p>  The CER's gas safety regime comprises an annual programme of audits and inspection of regulated entities, the investigation of complaints regarding gas installers and an enforcement regime where action is required. </p><p>  The CER has legal responsibilities in regard to the Promotion and Public Awareness of gas safety and may direct a gas undertaking to engage in related publicity campaigns. A variety of campaigns have been carried out, including the following:</p><p>  -  What to do when a member of the public smells gas, i.e. phone the Bord Gais Networks 24 hour emergency phone line (1850 20 50 50);</p><p>  -  Only use a Registered Gas Installer for the installation, repair or servicing of domestic type gas appliances;</p><p>  -  Carbon Monoxide awareness campaigns; and</p><p>  -  The &quot;Dial Before You Dig&quot; campaign to encourage people to contact Bord Gais Networks prior to undertaking excavation works in order that underground gas pipes are not damaged.</p></reply>

Many countries, including the UK, have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite. The reason for this is simple. It is technically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform. However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State. </p><p>  That said, I have noted the specific details of the case raised by the Deputy in this Question and have had them brought to the attention of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s network company, 2RN and I will write to the Deputy directly on this matter.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. The regulation of the industry is a matter for ComReg which is independent in the exercise of its functions. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg&rsquo;s website at   , as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in County Kildare. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last month, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband. The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market.</p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in a number of locations in County Kildare including Newbridge before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy. </p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work continues in my Department in relation to a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

During the 12 months to November 2013, site resolution plans were fully implemented on 553 developments. The National Housing Development Survey 2013, which carries details of all unfinished housing developments, can be found on the Housing Agency website </p><p>  Budget 2014 contains a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments. The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition. </p><p>  In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications is 28 February 2014. Submissions will then be evaluated by my Department and funding allocations made to local authorities as soon as possible thereafter.   </p><p>  My Department will support SRF proposals capable of delivering significant and lasting impact in relation to the quality of the resolution process itself and improved conditions for residents. It is hoped that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act (No. 2) 2013 provides for the transfer of water services functions from the local authorities to Irish Water. The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. The CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. Hard water is not included as a parameter in the quality standards specified in the Regulations, as it does not pose as a threat to human health. The Environmental Protection Agency is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations. </p><p>  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 requires that Irish Water will prepare codes of practice, on a range of matters, including standards in relation to the performance by Irish Water of its functions and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided. Irish Water will also be required to prepare a code of practice on any matter considered necessary by the CER. I expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in fulfilling its functions.</p><p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges.   The group comprises officials from my Department and from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. The terms of reference of the group include identifying groups likely to face affordability issues, examining appropriate mechanisms for addressing affordability issues for these groups and outlining the administrative arrangements required to deliver on the recommended approach.  The group has met seven times to date.  A final report will be submitted for consideration by Government when the group has completed its examination of the issues involved.   No decision has yet been taken on the level of, or the approach to, the free allowance.  However, it is under active consideration, and I would expect to bring proposals to Government shortly.</p><p>  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No.2) Act, 2013. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan and will engage in public consultation on the approach to charges.  In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water, including the funding available for the free allowance and any proposed affordability measures.</p></reply>

Currently, where a person&rsquo;s occupancy commences after the date of the making of the rate, that person, as a subsequent occupier, could be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies.  However, Schedule 2 Part 6 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for a change to rating law which will remove this subsequent occupier liability.     </p><p>  It is not the intention in removing subsequent occupier liability to undermine local authorities&rsquo; collection powers and put at risk the collection of rates income. Therefore, section 32 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for all unpaid and outstanding rates liabilities to be discharged prior to the transfer of ownership or other interest in a property (including tenancy) and that this transfer of interest must be notified to the local authority within two weeks of its effect. This measure is intended to strengthen local authority collection powers in this area without causing any additional burden for subsequent occupiers.  Furthermore, the amendment provides that any rates due by an owner of relevant property and not discharged shall remain a charge on the property.   </p><p>  Under these new provisions, should the owner fail to notify the local authority of a change of occupancy, the Act provides that the owner or landlord will become liable for an amount which is equivalent to two years of outstanding liabilities that may have accrued in respect of any previous occupier of the property.  Any amount of that charge that remains unpaid by an owner will become a charge on the property for up to 12 years. The imposition of such a charge on the landlord or owner does not transfer any liability that may rest with any previous occupier.   </p><p>  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 was signed by the President on 27 January 2014.  The timing of the commencement of the provisions outlined above is being considered in the context of the timetable for commencement of the Act generally.  My Department will be consulting with local authorities in that regard, in order to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place, and likewise that ratepayers and property owners are properly notified of the new obligations.</p></reply>

In addition it is also worth noting that, in line with the arrangements for the registration of construction professionals under the Building Control Act 2007, such registered professionals are now subject to review by a professional conduct committee.  Where a Professional Conduct Committee considers a complaint and determines that a registered professional is guilty of professional misconduct or poor professional performance, the Committee has the power to advise, admonish or censure the registered professional in relation to the performance complained of, or, subject to confirmation from the High Court of the Committee&rsquo;s decision to exercise such powers, to impose a fine for a specified amount, to withdraw the person&rsquo;s name from the register for a specified period, to erase the person&rsquo;s name from the register or to impose conditions to be complied with by the registered professional in order for their name to remain on the register.  </p><p>  The Building Control Act 2007 and the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 both serve to increase the level of accountability that is required in relation to construction projects.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.   </p><p>  Under the 2007 fire service capital programme, a proposal by Cork County Council to build a new two bay fire station in Kanturk was approved in principle.  The Council was subsequently approved to prepare detailed design and tender documents in relation to the project. My Department wrote to the Council in 2008 expressing concern at the site acquisition costs and their implication for the total project cost, requesting that other potential sites in Kanturk be considered. </p><p>  Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as one of the key national priorities for the fire services capital programme. In that context and in order to deliver cost efficiencies, a programme involving fire authorities aggregating demand and jointly procuring 17 fire appliances is now nearing completion, under which Cork County Fire and Rescue Service received an allocation for two new appliances.   </p><p>  Given the constraints on public finances, further support from my Department&rsquo;s fire services capital programme to replace Kanturk fire station will have regard to national priorities, the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, Cork County Council&rsquo;s priorities, the extent of previous investment in Cork fire service, the value for money offered by proposals and the status of existing facilities having regard to risk categorisation.      </p></reply>

Details regarding the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website </p><p>  The period for public submissions has closed and submissions from a variety of interested parties are now under consideration in my Department.   I expect to be in a position to formulate future policy approaches and actions, taking account of the consultation process, in the near future.   </p><p>  In 2013, I asked the Housing Agency to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. While I have received an initial draft of the review from the Agency a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. This data collection exercise has been initiated and will inform future actions.   </p><p>  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending outcome of the review.   </p><p>  I fully recognise that shared ownership home owners, amongst others, have been affected by issues such as unemployment and possible negative equity.  In such cases, borrowers should actively engage with their lenders, whether a commercial financial institution or a local authority, to seek to avail of one of the options available to provide sustainable solutions to distressed mortgages.   </p><p>  The mortgage arrears resolution process, already in place in respect of commercial mortgages, is now being implemented across all local authorities. In cases of acute mortgage distress , homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.   </p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a Mortgage to Rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body and the family becomes a tenant of the approved housing body.  Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support. </p><p>  The scheme for local authority borrowers in arrears, which was piloted in two local authority areas, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, was implemented nationally in recent weeks.  With the support of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Housing Finance Agency, I will be allocating an additional &euro;20m to the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) fund in 2014 to significantly expand the capacity of that process to assist households in mortgage distress.   </p></reply>

In accordance with Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, up to 20% of the dwellings were made available for social housing purposes. As a result some 60 apartments were acquired by Tuath Housing Association at a cost of over &euro;15 million and funded under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). Under the terms of the CLSS Approved Housing Bodies received a grant of up to 100% of the cost of constructing or purchasing accommodation for low-income families. A n annual management and maintenance allowance of &euro;543   is also payable in respect of dwellings occupied by persons drawn from the local authority housing waiting lists. </p><p>  I met with the CEO and technical personnel from Tuath last Wednesday and was advised of the design and construction issues which are giving rise to problems in Tuath-owned properties at Gallery Quay. It appears that the external fabric of the building, which consists of a rendered concrete slab with internally skimmed plasterboard on a proprietary steel dry-wall frame, is subject to water ingress. As a result, during wet and windy conditions, water appears to leak through the outer skin and run down the face of the external wall. Seals around windows and doors also appear to permit water ingress. This, in turn, is giving rise to dampness, condensation and mould growth. The problems became more apparent during the recent wet and stormy weather. Not all apartments are subject to water ingress but I understand that up to 12 units are severely affected. </p><p>  I understand Tuath&rsquo;s building surveyors are currently carrying out a detailed apartment-by-apartment condition survey of all their units at Gallery Quay and are drawing up a schedule of works to address all latent and inherent defects as soon as possible. I understand the joinery suppliers are also proposing to carry out an on-site inspection and to advise of water ingress around doors and windows. My Department will await the submission of this report and, having considered it, will be happy to engage with Tuath in advancing the optimum solution for remedying the situation. </p><p>  My Department is liaising closely with Tuath and Dublin City Council to ascertain the cause of the water ingress and in advancing practical and sustainable refurbishment works to resolve the problem. My Department&rsquo;s Architectural Inspector along with colleagues from the City Council accepted an invitation from Tuath to attend an on-site meeting last Friday with the relevant insurers and to assess the nature and extent of the problem. It will take some time to fully and comprehensively evaluate the cause of the water ingress and to develop and implement appropriate remediation measures. In the interim, Tuath are carrying out palliative repairs to the building fabric in order to deal with the immediate problems caused by water ingress and to prevent further damage to homes in the event of a storm.   </p><p>  At this stage, it would appear that the problems affecting the Tuath apartments at Gallery Quay are site-specific and are primarily due to design and workmanship issues. My Department will continue to work closely with Tuath and Dublin City Council to ensure that suitable arrangements are in place to effect the necessary remedial works and that appropriate accommodation is provided for those families who may have to vacate their homes while the refurbishment works are on-going.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-25a.1013.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022500068#WRQ03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 475, 492 and 499 together. </p><p>  The new Building Control Amendment Regulations which come into operation on 1 March 2014 will greatly strengthen the arrangements currently in place for the control of building activity by requiring greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates. The new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their statutory obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the building regulations. These obligations apply to all sectors of the housing market, including the self-build sector. </p><p>  The Building Control Act and any regulations thereunder, including S.I. No. 9 of 2014, place no restrictions on whom an owner may assign as a builder. </p><p>  The necessity to limit a signatory of the certificate of compliance on completion to a Principal or Director arises in the context of a company only. Where a self-builder is acting on his or her own behalf, there are no agents or intermediaries involved, and the potential for confusion over legal responsibility does not therefore arise. </p><p>  In a self-build situation the legal responsibilities of both the owner and the builder will rest with the self-builder. An owner who intends to self-build will, therefore, prior to commencement, notify the building control authority that they are the builder and also sign and lodge the new form of undertaking by the builder. By signing this undertaking they declare that: they will undertake to construct the dwelling in accordance with the design as certified; any persons employed or engaged to undertake any part of the works will be competent; they will cooperate with the inspection plan prepared by the Assigned Certifier; and that they will take all reasonable steps to ensure they will certify the works, in conjunction with the assigned certifier, on completion.</p><p>  Details of the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) are currently available on the relevant website, , established by the Construction Industry Federation. The register is a voluntary one at present but the Government is committed to placing it on a statutory footing in 2015. </p><p>  The new regulatory requirements were the subject of an extensive public consultation undertaken in April/May 2012 which resulted in S.I. No. 80 of 2013 being made in March 2013 to come into effect on 1 March 2014. While S.I. No. 9 of 2014 revokes and replaces S.I. No 80 of 2013 in order primarily to allow for the rewording of the statutory certificates in the interests of insurability, there were no change of key principles or requirements involved and the implementation date remains as 1 March 2014. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the necessary arrangements for implementation are in place and the question of deferral does not therefore arise. </p></reply>

The report of the independent Pyrite Panel provides the framework for the remediation scheme and the eligibility criteria are reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of the report.  The Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.  </p><p>  In this context, I have recently approved the draft pyrite remediation scheme prepared by the Board in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act; the Board will begin to accept applications from homeowners affected by pyritic damage from 26 February 2014.  The full conditions of eligibility of the scheme are set out in the Pyrite Remediation Scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website &ndash;<i></i><i></i> .  The scheme sets out the full detail of each of the stages involved in the process from the making of an application through to completion of the remediation works.</p><p>  While the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the definition for &ldquo;significant pyritic damage&rdquo;, which correlates to the definition contained in the <i>Irish Standard 398-1:2013</i><i>Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material - Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol as</i> published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, it also makes provision to enable the Board to set the damage condition rating within the meaning of &ldquo;significant pyritic damage&rdquo; for the purpose of including dwellings in the scheme.  The scheme as now made provides for the remediation of dwellings with a damage condition rating of 2.  <font color="#FF0000"> </font></p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary. </p><p>  An Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention is monitoring the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  The Committee has identified as part of its work programme, issues to be considered by various Government Departments.  It is a matter for those Departments to determine whether any actions are required in relation to these issues in advance of ratification and report back to the Committee.  This work is ongoing in all Departments.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is also assisting it to assess remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>  As regards my own Department one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and to exercise their basic rights, in line with the principles of the UN Convention.  It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity.

These crimes cause deep distress to those affected and have a broader impact in terms of fear of crime in the community.</p><p>  Garda Operation Fiacla was established to coordinate a sustained national drive against those involved in this type of criminality and has been proven to be successful nationally, with several thousand arrests and prosecutions for burglary offences, reflected in the most recent crime figures which show burglary incidents down by more than 10%.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continue to work closely with communities through Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other organisations to provide expert crime prevention advice. The Garda commitment to this approach was underlined in the new guidelines for communities wishing to set up community crime prevention schemes which were launched by the Commissioner and myself last year.   Advice in respect of crimes targeted at farms is also available, including in the form of a Garda Farm Security Booklet.</p><p>  My Department does not provide direct funding in relation to local crime prevention projects but it has, for many years, provided funding for the Community Alert programme which is operated by  Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda authorities and supports over 1,300 local groups. The funding provided by my Department supports the employment and associated costs of a National Coordinator and Development Officers who play a key role in supporting community crime prevention efforts.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the prevention and disruption of agricultural crimes in border areas involves a multi-agency approach including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), the Department of Agriculture and Marine Investigation Unit, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (Northern Ireland) and Revenue and Customs here and in Northern Ireland, as well as ongoing Garda liaison with the Irish Farmers Association.   In this regard a number of operations are in place including a focus on the movement of livestock, as well as on the theft of farm and plant machinery.  These operations take place under the aegis of an agreed Cross-Border Policing Strategy designed to continue the excellent levels of cooperation between both police service in tackling crime.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also established a metal theft forum involving stakeholders particularly affected by this type of crime, including the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers association.  Building on their existing crime prevention operations and advice, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published a Metal Theft Crime Prevention and Reduction Plan, which was developed in close cooperation with the stakeholders who participated in the metal theft forum and it is designed to provide for an effective and multi-agency response to the problem of metal theft, as it affects those in rural as in other areas.</p></reply>

In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.</p><p>  Garda management keep the distribution of personnel under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>  The success of ongoing Garda crime prevention and detection work is demonstrated in the latest official recorded crime figures from the Central Statistics Office, which cover the 12 month period to end Q3 in 2013.  These figures show reductions or no change in 12 out of the 14 categories for which figures are given, and an overall reduction of 7.1%, building on reductions recorded in the previous figures from the CSO.  The continued impact of Garda operations on burglary is reflected in a significant fall of 10.4% in this category of offence, further accelerating the reductions seen since earlier in the year.  Garda actions to counteract burglary under Operation Fiacla have led to the arrest of 7,973 persons and 4,558 persons being charged as of 31 January 2014.</p></reply>

She was medically assessed on her committal to prison, and was seen by the Prison Doctor the next day. She has access to a 24 hour nursing service in prison, and daily access to a doctor if requested, or on referral  by the nursing staff. In the event of an emergency arising she will be transferred immediately to acute hospital care services.</p><p>  I can confirm that the prisoner referred to is having ongoing medical treatment  for a serious illness and is also accessing hospital consultant services in the community. She is currently awaiting a review appointment with specialist services and any hospital appointment she may  have scheduled will be facilitated by prison management.  The prisoner concerned does have some age related mobility issues, and uses a walking stick.</p><p>  The prisoner concerned has not been independently assessed but she has received all clinical interventions deemed necessary. If a doctor, or other healthcare professional, operating in the prison environment determines that a prisoner requires treatment in an external setting following a clinical assessment, an appropriate referral will be made.</p><p>  I am quite satisfied that the care needs of the prisoner concerned  are been managed appropriately by the Irish Prison Service.</p></reply>

At Divisional level it is a matter for the Divisional Officer to determine how best to allocate vehicles so as to ensure the continued delivery of an effective policing service.</p><p>  In that context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the details sought by the Deputy are outlined in the following table:<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>No. Of vehicles</th></tr><tr><td>31st January 2009</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>31st January 2010</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>31st January 2011</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>31st January 2012</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>31st January 2013</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>31st January 2014</td><td>49</td></tr></table></p><p>  Overall, the Deputy will be aware that I recently secured a further &euro;9m for investment in the Garda fleet.

These were in addition to the 133 new Garda vehicles which had already been procured during the year. The remaining &euro;4 million has been made available for the purchase and fit out of Garda vehicles in 2014.  I am advised that the new vehicles were delivered in late December 2013 and are currently being allocated, following fit out, in accordance with the Commissioner's operational requirements.</p><p>  The most recent investment will bring to &euro;18m the total amount spent on the Garda fleet for the three years 2012 to 2014.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to deliver an effective and efficient policing service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-25a.1166.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022500071#WRT00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 538 and 548 together.</p><p>  I share the widespread outrage at the recent incidents of aggravated burglary in the Donegal area, as highlighted at the meeting referred to, and condemn in the strongest possible terms those who prey on vulnerable and isolated members of our community in this way.</p><p>  The Garda&iacute; are determined to identify those responsible for these crimes and to bring them before the Courts. In this regard I am aware that  additional resources have been deployed to support an Operation in the Donegal Division with a particular focus on crimes against the elderly and including intelligence led patrols, checkpoints, intelligence gathering and analysis. This operation is being run in conjunction with the National and Regional Operations Fiacla and Airgead, set up to combat instances of criminality, including burglary and related crimes. Targeted patrolling has been intensified following the recent incidents of burglaries and related crimes, and there is ongoing and excellent liaison between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  As part of operation Fiacla, these methods have been proven to be successful nationally, with several thousand arrests and prosecutions for burglary offences, reflected in the most recent crime figures which show burglary incidents down by more than 10%.  Notwithstanding the recent disturbing incidents, I am also advised that Garda crime figures for burglary and for offences against the person are also down within the specific Donegal area.  I fully appreciate that these statistics will be cold comfort to those who have recently undergone the traumatic experience of being burgled and assaulted, but I feel that it is important to cite this information, to illustrate the success and determination of Garda efforts to reduce these crimes and bring perpetrators to justice.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continue to work closely with communities through Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other organisations to provide expert crime prevention advice and support to communities. The Garda commitment to this approach was underlined in the new guidelines for communities wishing to set up community crime prevention schemes which were launched by the Commissioner and myself last year.  I understand that work is ongoing within the Donegal Division with respect to the establishment and revitalisation where appropriate of a number of Community Alert Schemes, as part of overall crime prevention awareness.</p><p>  With regard to funding being made available to set up Community Alert Schemes from money collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau, I can inform the Deputy that all monies collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are returned to the Exchequer in accordance with relevant legislation.  Such funds are paid into the Government's Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment. While it has, from time to time, been suggested that such monies should be used to fund community projects, the suggestion is considered problematic and raises a number of practical issues on which I have previously advised the House. Therefore, while I appreciate the symbolic value to the Deputy's suggestion, I hope he will accept that there are no proposals to change the existing arrangements concerning the destination of such monies.  </p><p>  However, in relation to Community Alert my Department has, for many years, provided funding for the programme which  is operated by  Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda authorities and which supports the operation of  over 1,300 local groups. Funding totalling &euro;152,000 was provided by my Department in 2013 which supports the employment and associated costs of a National Coordinator and Development Officers for the scheme.   The work of Community Alert continues to be highly valued and decisions on the precise level of funding which may be provided by my Department in 2014 will be made as soon as possible in the context of the available resources.</p><p>  With regard to funding for alarm systems for elderly persons, the position is that<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>  the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government provides funding for the Senior Alert Scheme.  The aim of the Scheme is to ensure independent living for those over 65 who live alone.  A key element of the Scheme is the provision of funding for a personal monitored alarm and I am aware that Community Alert and other community organisations provide advice and assistance at a local level with respect to applications under the scheme. </p></reply>

I am sure that, on reflection, the Deputy will appreciate that that practice, which has been followed by my predecessors, arises for sound security reasons.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the legislative basis for the carrying out of covert surveillance is the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 while the interception of telecommunications is provided for in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.  </p><p>  From the outset I should clarify that as Minister for Justice and Equality I have no role whatsoever in the operation of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act  2009. Under the 2009 Act, authorisations for intrusive surveillance are granted by a judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners or the Defence Forces in circumstances which are set out in the Act.</p><p>  In relation to interception, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 provides that an authorisation for interception may only be granted by Ministerial warrant on application from the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime or protecting the security of the State. </p><p>  I should emphasise, however, that both Acts are subject to independent judicial oversight by Judges of the High Court, designated by the Government for that purpose.  The Designated Judge has complete and unrestricted access to all cases, documents, records, and personnel pertaining to the operation of the relevant legislation.  In addition, each Designated Judge reports to the Taoiseach on an annual basis on the operation of the legislation. These reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, both Acts provide for a complaints mechanism whereby an individual who believes that he or she has been subject to surveillance or whose communications have been intercepted may apply to the Complaints Referee, appointed in accordance with the relevant Act, for an investigation into the matter.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I am maintaining the long-standing practice of my predecessors, but I can assure the Deputy, I have never exercised the extensive legal powers I have to interfere in anyway with the work of the categories of persons referred to.</p></reply>

The position  remains the same.   I should also point out that the policy applies only to future applications for family reunification.  Persons already having residence permission on that basis are not impacted and the new arrangements are without prejudice to the rights of foreign nationals to apply for residence in their own right, for instance as workers or students.<blockquote><i>  The intention of theses guidelines is to provide greater transparency and more comprehensive and consistent standards in respect of applications where non-EEA nationals seek to come to live in Ireland on the basis of their relationship with an Irish citizen or with another non-EEA national entitled to reside here.</i><br /><br /><i>  As the Deputy will appreciate, even if his correspondent does not, this issue must be considered in the wider context of public policy and must strike a fair balance between the sometimes competing interests of the individual and society in general. One of the key principles underpinning this balance of interests is that family reunification should not cause an undue burden on the public finances.  The financial capacity of the sponsor is an important condition for family reunification and the guidelines also place greater emphasis on the question of dependency.   It is not credible that a person who is unable to support him/herself without assistance from the State can adequately fulfil the role of sponsor nor is it reasonable to assume that in the absence of such capacity, the State should undertake to do so from the public purse.  </i><br /><br /><i>  This is a fundamental principle not alone in Ireland but throughout the EU and indeed in all countries which operate sensible policies and priorities in this regard.</i></blockquote></p></reply>

However, the payments will be backdated to the 1st August 2013 so the women will not be at a loss.</p><p>  Judge Quirke recommended that legislation be introduced to give effect to his recommendation with regard to the provision of medical services to the women who were admitted to and worked in the relevant institutions.  While this is a health issue, it has been agreed that my Department would coordinate legislation to implement Judge Quirke's recommendations.  The necessary legislation is included on the priority list of the Government Legislation Programme for the Spring/Summer 2014.  Details of exactly what services will be provided is being determined by the Department of Health.  My officials are working with that Department in finalising the drafting of the necessary legislative provisions as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

To this end, on the 5th November 2013, the Government agreed to the payments and services to be provided on an individual basis to the women who came within the scope of the scheme.  Within my own Department, a unit of 9 officials is working full time on engaging with the women and processing applications.  They are available to answer any queries the women may have in relation to the Scheme.  Decisions on establishing a permanent and separate dedicated unit, its role and method of operation have not been finalised as yet.

Recruitment of personnel to the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps is determined in line with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  As the Permanent Defence Force is currently below the agreed stabilised strength of 9,500, it is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue this year within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.  To that end, it is planned to run a new General Service recruitment competition this year and this will be launched shortly. Details of the competition will be made available on the Defence Forces website    when the competitions commence.  Recruitment of Cadets, Air Corps Apprentices and Naval Service Engine Room Artificers is also planned for 2014.</p><p>  Application for General Service Recruitment to the Defence Forces is conducted on-line and all correspondence is conducted via e-mail. Candidates must successfully complete fitness testing, online psychometric testing, interview and psychometric testing verification in order to progress through the competition.  Following these stages of the recruitment process, successful applicants may be placed on panels and may be offered a position, subject to successfully completing a medical examination and obtaining Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Security Clearance.  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

Where necessary, relevant restrictions and protective measures to protect groundwater in the context of the relevant pieces of chemical legislation, Water Framework Directive and the Drinking Water Directive may be applied.  The Regulatory system for wood preservative products (such as bituminous products) and treated timber (such as poles used in electrical transmission and telecommunications) in Ireland is based on European legislation for chemicals. These pieces of legislation are underpinned by the precautionary principle and the stated aims are to ensure high levels of protection for humans, animals and the environment, which includes protection of groundwater for the purposes of environmental integrity and drinking water safety.  The relevant pieces of legislation include:</p><p>- Commission Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (the REACH Regulation) which ensures that appropriate restrictions are in place on the manufacture, placing on the market and use of certain substances, mixtures (i.e. wood preservative products) and articles (i.e. the treated timber poles) to protect human health;</p><p>- Commission Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 concerning the making available and use of biocidal products (the BPR) to ensure that biocidal active substances, such as bituminous derivatives, are reviewed by the EU Member States and that only those active substances that are approved following the review are placed on the market, are used correctly and are correctly labelled; and</p><p>- Directive 2000/60/EC establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (the Water Framework Directive) as transposed in to Irish law by S.I. 722 of 2003 (as amended) and also S.I. 9 of 2010 gives further effect to the Water Framework Directive in the area of groundwater protection.</p><p>  When granting approvals for biocidal products, special attention is paid, within the product assessment, to the data and its relation to the above legislation impacting on the approval.  Accordingly, depending on the conclusions drawn following assessment of these products and the in-service use of the treated timber it is possible to apply restrictions and specific conditions to the product approval or to refuse authorisation where warranted.</p></reply>

Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), a commercial state body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.  Each year HRI publishes its annual report and accounts, audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This publication contains considerable detail on the performance of various facets of the industry in the reference year.  In addition Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) publish a <i>&ldquo;Factbook&rdquo;</i> annually which contains a wealth of information on this very important industry.  HRI issues bulletins in the course of the year tracking the key performance indicators for the sector.  The  HRI website    also carries up-to-date information on developments on an on-going basis.  The <i>&ldquo;Weatherbys Factbook&rdquo;</i>  , published by Weatherbys GSB Ltd. &amp;amp; Weatherbys Ireland GSB Ltd, is an annual publication containing very interesting statistics on the Irish bloodstock industry.  In 2013 the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association (ITBA) published <i>&ldquo;Analysis of the Economic Impact of the Irish Thoroughbred Industry&rdquo;</i>  . This report contained the results of a study commissioned by the ITBA and follows on from similar studies commissioned by the ITBA in 2009 and 2010.  The sales companies also publish information on the industry on their websites.</p><p>  Most recent information available shows:</p><p>- The Irish bloodstock breeding and racing industry is of major national importance in terms of employment (especially in rural areas), exports and tourism. Approximately 14,000 people are employed in the thoroughbred industry in Ireland, mostly in rural areas and it attracts significant inward investment to the country. The value of the industry is estimated at almost &euro;1.1bn annually. <i>&ldquo;Analysis of the Economic Impact of the Irish Thoroughbred Industry&rdquo;, </i>  ITBA (2013) and HRI Factbook 2012, HRI (2013);</p><p>- Ireland remains the biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe and is the fourth largest producer in the world (behind USA, Australia and Argentina); and</p><p>- Approximately 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds and 11% of the total worldwide are produced in Ireland.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Analysis of the Economic Impact of the Irish Thoroughbred Industry&rdquo;, </i>  ITBA (2013) and HRI Factbook 2012, HRI (2013)  </p><p>  HRI report that growth has returned to key areas in 2013 compared to 2012 HRI Press Release 15<sup>th</sup> January, 2013:</p><p>- Value of bloodstock sales sold through public auction, up 43% to &euro;133.4m;</p><p>- Attendances at racecourses 1.24m, up 4%;</p><p>- Tote betting up 6.5%, but on-course betting down 4.6%;</p><p>- Prize money up 2.5% to &euro;46m and commercial sponsorship increased by 1.6%;</p><p>- Numbers of horses in training down 0.4% to 9,119; and</p><p>- Number of owners decreased by 5.7% to 3,966. </p><p>  HRI announced 5% increase in prize money to &euro;48.5m in 2014 and a reduction of 10% in administration charges to owners and trainers in an effort to encourage new owners.

These services are delivered through a network of agricultural colleges, regional education and local centres and in collaboration with three privately-owned colleges.  Within the various colleges and at local level, Teagasc provide an extensive range of courses in agriculture, horticulture, equine studies and forestry.  They currently cater for in excess of 2,000 full time college students, some 10,000 adult learners and also provide degree level courses in collaboration with various Institutes of Technology. A small number of VEC colleges have also commenced provision of Green Cert courses.</p><p>  There has been a large increase in the demand for student places in recent years reflecting the positivity towards the Agri- food and farming sectors generally.  The allocation of resources in Teagasc to the education function is an internal operational matter for Teagasc management.  To cope with the increased demand, Teagasc was granted exceptional sanction in 2011 to recruit six contract teaching staff in the agricultural colleges.  This measure was complemented by other Teagasc initiatives including increased student- teacher ratios, redeployment of six advisory staff to the colleges and subcontracting the delivery of specific education modules across a number of colleges and local centres.</p><p>  They were subsequently approved to fill a further 6 positions on a temporary basis for periods up to 12 months in respect of teaching staff on short term leave etc.  In addition, my Department in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently approved the filling of 11 mission critical posts in Teagasc on an exceptional basis under the moratorium.  Additional teaching resources were approved under this measure.</p></reply>

Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.</p><p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database.  This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included. In certain circumstances these adjustments are giving rise to penalties.  A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised.  In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials. If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the <i>Independent LPIS Appeals Committee</i>, chaired by Mr Padraig Gibbons.</p><p>  The LPIS Review process initiated by my Department consisted on a review of all of the eligible land parcels in the LPIS database, which was declared by farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes. In total, the Review covered in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above-mentioned Schemes.</p><p>  It is important to note that there are some positive outcomes of the current Review from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view.  In the first instance, I announced last week that the number of payment entitlements, which farmers will be granted under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 will be based on the 2013 eligible land or in 2015 if it is lower.  This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013.  In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands.</p><p>  A deliberate decision was taken late last year not to delay payments to those farmers whose payments were due to be subject to reduction following the outcome of the Review; rather, the payments issued with the sums in question deducted, the farmers concerned being then advised of the reductions and the appeals process.  This course of action was specifically designed to ensure that there was no undue delay in issuing payments, while also ensuring that farmers were aware of the appeals process.</p></reply>

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism.  There is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing become more of a problem.  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission.</p><p>  The farming of commonages lands has a long tradition in Ireland. It is by its very nature a complex area &ndash; there are issues about the legal right to claim and there have always been disputes about the grazing of the commonages.  In the vast majority of cases, however, commonage shareholders work well together on a co-operative basis to maintain the commonages in GAEC or where there is under-grazing to return the habitat to GAEC.  My stated intention is to achieve this by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant state agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.  It will not be an easy task but it is achievable if we all work in a co-operative basis.  It is expected that this process will commence shortly.</p></reply>

The funding for that Scheme became available through the use of unused funds under the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 the Regulation that governed the Single Payment Scheme is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 which introduces the new Basic Payment Scheme and related schemes.</p><p>  The option to incorporate the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme into the value of the entitlements that will be allocated to sheep farmers is designed to safeguard these payments for such farmers. The implementation of this option in Ireland effectively ring-fences this significant fund for sheep farmers which otherwise would be distributed generally to the value of entitlements held by all farmers. </p><p>  As previously noted sheep farmers generally hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have the immediate benefit of an additional &euro;10.3 million in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

Approximately 14,000 people are employed in the thoroughbred industry in Ireland. The value of the industry is estimated at almost &euro;1.1bn annually and it attracts significant inward investment to the country. </p><p>  Irish Thoroughbred Marketing is proving adept at building markets overseas and driving inward investment. I believe there is great potential to grow the international market for Irish bloodstock in new and emerging markets, and to attract further inward investment  .</p><p>  I understand from Irish Thoroughbred Marketing that the following are some foreign investments that have been made in the thoroughbred and bloodstock sectors in Ireland in 2013 and to date in 2014:</p><p><b>Inward Investment:</b></p><p>  USA</p><p>  - A North American investor purchased an historic estate in Co. Meath, in 2013, with the intention of transforming it from an agricultural farm into a thoroughbred stud farm.</p><p>  QATAR </p><p>  - A Qatar businessman purchased a prestigious stud in Co. Limerick in 2013.   This investment will maintain employment and also represents an opportunity for further investment in Irish bloodstock as breeding stock is purchased for the farm. </p><p>  - At last year&rsquo;s Goffs Orby Sale, Ireland&rsquo;s premier yearling sale, a member of the Qatari ruling family who owns a stud farm in County Limerick invested &euro;2m in the purchase of 15 yearlings.</p><p>  - Again at last year&rsquo;s Goffs Orby Sale, another Qatar national invested &euro;2 million in 6 yearlings, purchased through the Irish-based bloodstock agents.  </p><p>  During the Ministerial Trade Mission to the Gulf States in 2013, I,  together with, ITM and HRI representatives met with these individuals  to acknowledge their significant investment in Ireland.  </p><p>  CHINA</p><p>  - In 2013, a leading figure in Chinese racing invested in 10 yearlings at the Goffs Orby sale, for &euro;300,000 in total.  These yearlings remained in Ireland for pre-training and were then dispersed amongst four Irish trainers.  This owner already had two horses in training in Ireland.   </p><p>  - In January 2014, a group of Chinese buyers purchased 12 horses for export to China.  These horses will be the first shipment under the new Veterinary Protocol between Ireland and China, which was agreed between my Department and the Chinese Authority AQSIQ in 2013, and allows for the direct export of horses from Ireland to China.  As a result of this Protocol, three further Chinese groups plan to travel to Ireland to purchase horses later this year.  </p><p>  SOUTH AMERICA </p><p>  - Investment in Irish breeding stock from South American investors topped &euro;1m in 2013, following their purchases at the Goffs November Sale last year.  With an ITM market visit to South America planned in March 2014, the plan is to build on this figure in 2014.</p><p>  - So far in 2014, there has been one International bloodstock sale in Ireland &ndash; The Goffs February Mixed Sale.  This sale saw buyers from Libya, India, Russia, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, etc. which helped to boost turnover for the sale by 46% on the previous year.</p><p>  - The Aggregate for the total amount of bloodstock sold at public auction in Ireland, in 2012, was &euro;93 million, this figure increased to &euro;133 million in 2013 (representing a 43% increase), with exports to 37 countries. </p><p><b>UPCOMING TRADE MISSIONS </b></p><p>  - In the first quarter of 2014, ITM will undertake Trade Missions to &ndash; </p><p>  - UAE </p><p>  - Qatar</p><p>  - Dubai</p><p>  - South America </p><p>  - Singapore </p><p>  Later in 2014, Market visits will also be made to China, Hong Kong, India, South Africa, USA, Mainland Europe, etc., with several Market Visits to the UK, maintaining and building on trade with Ireland&rsquo;s largest market for bloodstock</p><p>  These very encouraging developments are testament to the regard in which Irish bloodstock is held internationally and also reflect the efforts of both the Irish sales companies and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-25a.1343.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014022500073#WRV03200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 602, 603 and 606 together. </p><p>  On 12 February 2014, I informed the House that as part of its overall co-ordinated response to the impact of the recent unprecedented weather conditions, the Government had decided to allocate an additional &euro;8.8 million for the repair of the publicly owned pier, harbour and slipway network linked to fisheries and aquaculture and to allocate up to &euro;1.5 million to assist inshore fishermen in replacing lobster and shrimp pots lost or destroyed in the storms.</p><p>  While it is difficult to be definitive at this stage, following extensive consultation with local authorities, my engineers estimate that there are more than 100 pier, harbour and slipway projects involving significant damage across nine counties.  In light of the additional funds now available my Department has, as of 18 February, invited applications for funding from Local Authorities in respect of projects which relate to the repair of public fishery and aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways damaged in the recent storm events. The closure date for applications is Friday 28 February. This scheme will form an extended part my Department's 2014 capital programme which provides support for the maintenance and development of public piers and harbours on an annual basis. In 2014, priority will be given to projects which relate to the repair of public Fishery and Aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways damaged in the recent storm events.   </p><p>  In addition to the funding to be provided to local authorities, my Department will be moving to repair storm damage to piers, harbours and coastal infrastructure in its direct ownership. This will include moving as quickly as possible to repair the significant storm damage to North Harbour in Cape Clear, West Cork; Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre, County Waterford; the Gun Rock beacon, Inisboffin, County Mayo; the West Cove navigational beacon, County Kerry; and Roonagh Pier, County Mayo. </p><p>  In relation to inshore fishermen, a temporary one-off scheme of assistance to these pot fishermen is now available through Bord Iascaigh Mhara, with a closing date of 28 March 2014.  The Scheme is focused on smaller inshore fishermen, with vessels under 15 metres. It provides a set amount of &euro;24 per lobster pot lost or &euro;12 per shrimp pot lost, equivalent to 40% of the replacement cost, and is capped at a maximum of 50 pots for under 12 metre vessels and 100 for under 15 metre vessels.  A fisherman who has lost 100 pots at the replacement cost of approximately &euro;6,000 will receive assistance of a little under &euro;2,500. While I am conscious that some pot fishermen have reported losses of several hundred pots, I believe these are exceptional cases.  The &euro;1.5 million budget for this Scheme will be borne by the existing Vote within my Department and is not additional funding. There is no scope to increase this budget further, so I am emphasising that should applications exceed this budget, the rate of assistance will be reduced, either in terms of the amount of payment per pot or the maximum number of pots, in order to remain within a managed budget.</p><p>  The Deputies will agree that these are significant interventions in the current economic circumstances and are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to assisting rural coastal communities and the inshore fishing sector with their recovery from the storms.</p><p>  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.   </p><p>  The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February are significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, I have agreed with Industry to set allocations for March for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.  These increased quotas and fishing opportunities for March will help to re-balance the landings to bring them more into line with planned annual spread of quota uptake.  They can be further adjusted in April to take into account of the low level of landings in the first 6 weeks of the year.  </p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has the overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in the circumstances that have arisen.  Minister Burton&rsquo;s Department runs a number of schemes to support people in circumstances of loss of income. </p><p>  Under the Common Fisheries Policy, the proposed Regulation on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will replace the present European Fisheries Fund, and is to cover the period 2014 &ndash; 2020.  While the co-legislators have reached political agreement on the proposed EMFF Regulation, it will not be adopted in law until probably June this year.  My Department is working to prepare a new Operational Programme for the seafood sector under the EMFF.  That Programme is dependent on the progress of the proposed Regulation and so is likely to be finalised towards the end of the year.  There are many potential investments in the proposed EMFF Regulation and Member States are not expected to include all in their operational programmes.  Each member state must make investment choices, having regard to the finite allocation from the EMFF that each Member State will receive.  I am working closely with all stakeholders in making those hard choices between many competing and worthwhile investment priorities.  It is thus premature from both a legal and practical perspective to say at this time how the EMFF may assist fishermen with gear replacement or upgrade.  Having said that, the elimination of discards and reducing the impact on the marine environment of fishing gear are key elements of the new CFP and I am committed to assisting fishermen in adjusting fishing practices to comply with these CFP rules.  The proposed EMFF Regulation allows Member States to provide financial assistance with EMFF co-funding to fishermen towards the cost of gear that meets these policy objectives.</p></reply>

Due to an oversight, no response issued to this correspondence, which is regretted. </p><p>  The background to this case is that a cow tested as part of the annual round test of the herd owned by the person concerned on 26 July 2013 showed a positive result for TB. This result was subsequently confirmed by means of an examination by a Department Veterinary Inspector and also by means of the appropriate blood test.  Under relevant EU and national legislation designed to eradicate this disease, an animal which discloses a positive result to a TB test must be deemed a reactor and must be removed in a timely manner from the herd.  I might add that the fact that TB lesions were not detected following slaughter of the animal in no way undermines the definitive nature of the above results.   </p><p>  The herdowner refused to co-operate with the normal arrangements in place for removal of the reactor on two occasions and also failed to comply with a 7 day statutory notice requiring him to arrange delivery of the animal to a slaughter plant.  The reactor animal was eventually removed from the holding on 25 September in the presence of 3 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 4 Department staff.  </p><p>  Entitlement to compensation in the event of a TB disease breakdown is conditional on a herdowner complying with the provisions of the EU and national regulations governing the TB Eradication scheme. As the person named demonstrably refused to co-operate with the removal of the reactor, compensation was not paid in respect of the reactor removed.</p><p>  The herd concerned is no longer restricted, having passed the requisite two clear tests, at 60 day intervals, from the date the reactor animal was removed from the holding.  </p></reply>

The markets outside of the EU currently open to the live cattle export trade from Ireland are Egypt, the Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya. </p><p>  With regard to the export of live cattle to the EU, there is already a good system of Roll-On Roll-Off Ferry services bringing livestock trucks from Ireland to France.  In addition to this, a ferry has recently been approved by my Department for the carriage of livestock between Ireland and Great Britain.  The opening of this service is welcome as it gives greater flexibility than the current situation whereby livestock trucks have to travel to Larne or Belfast to gain access to Great Britain. </p><p>  Applications for the approval of ships for the carriage of cattle by sea must be approved by my Department in accordance with the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Orders, 1996 and 1998.  My Department facilitates the export of live cattle by ensuring that such applications are processed expeditiously.  Detailed inspections are required before approval is given to ships transporting animals and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine continues to work with all those involved &ndash; including farmers and transporters - to facilitate trade and ensure that all such trade is carried out to the highest animal health and welfare standards. </p><p>  To date nine applications for approval have been received in total.  Two ships have been fully approved and seven others have been inspected.

A Children First Implementation Inter-Departmental Group has been established involving key Government Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Child and Family Agency.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is represented on this Group and additionally, a representative of the Irish Sports Council also attends.   </p><p>  The purpose of the Group is to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure consistency of approach.  The Group has completed a benchmark phase of establishing structures, mechanisms and activities in place within each sector to support and drive the implementation process.  In July 2013 the Government approved the publication of each Departmental Children First Sectoral Implementation Plan on the relevant Department websites.  A key priority of the Group is the development of appropriate reporting mechanisms in respect of the implementation of Children First within each sector and the assurance arrangements to monitor implementation and compliance. </p><p>  It is important to emphasise that there have been significant legal and structural reform changes to improve all of the systems of protection of children in Ireland.  In my own area, these changes include the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the ongoing implementation of Children First National Guidelines and the development of legislation to put key aspects of Children First on a statutory footing.  Officials from my Department are continuing to liaise with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in relation to the drafting of the Children First Bill, which is now at an advanced stage.  The Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for the Spring/Summer session and I expect to submit it to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

As I have stated on a number of occasions it is important to note that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill.  A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person's request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent where consent has not been provided.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues.  One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to tease out precisely how this can be done in the context of what I must state is extremely strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy.  A number of European court cases also have addressed this issue and highly complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen.  I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution.  This is the reason it is taking this length of time to draft the Heads of Bill.  I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  </p><p>  I am not in a position to give a comprehensive account of the provisions of the proposed legislation until the Heads of Bill have been agreed by Government.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration.  The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.  In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound.</p></reply>

Community childcare services qualify for funding under the CCS programme on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The information provided in the parental declaration forms submitted to my Department is verified by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the HSE.  This information determines the level of subvention which applies to each individual parent.  The information is gathered during a 'snap shot' week in the month of October.</p><p>  Following verification, participating services are provided with a list of qualifying parents and confirmation of the subvention level applied to each parent.  Parents can appeal if they consider that they are entitled to a higher rate of subvention.  The verification and appeals process is necessary so as to ensure that all those applying for support under the programme satisfy the qualifying criteria.  It is only when this process is complete that the final figure to which each service is entitled can be determined.</p><p>  Unfortunately, the Department has found a high level of inaccuracies in the information submitted and this is a major contributory factor in the delays in finalising the final payment to providers.  It should be noted that my Department does make a number of preliminary payments to participating services prior to the final determination to ensure that services have sufficient funding to enable them to continue to provide the service.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the appeals process for this year is currently being processed at a quick pace and so, it is anticipated that the complete process will be finalised earlier than in previous years.  </p><p>  In relation to the ECCE programme, payments can only be made in respect of children who are within the qualifying age range.  When ECCE returns are received in the Department, the PPS numbers are forwarded to the Department of Social Protection in order to verify that the PPS number and the child's date of birth correspond.  When discrepancies arise, childcare services are required to forward documentation confirming the child's details.  Payments, which are backdated where necessary, issue as soon as possible after confirmation of the child's eligibility.  As is the case with the CCS programme, the level of accuracy of the information submitted by participating services has a major impact on the capacity of this Department to determine the final capitation payment to which services are entitled.  It has been necessary to make a small number of administrative changes to the programmes in recent years.  These have resulted from the need to ensure that funding is targeted at those most in need of support and that the considerable public funds committed to these programmes is providing the maximum benefit to the greatest possible number of qualifying children.   </p><p>  I would like also to advise the Deputy that in addition to the above programme new strands of childcare support programmes have been introduced to support parents and children in need of childcare supports for social, training or employment reasons.  Officials in my Department are currently working intensively to develop an ICT infrastructure to support the efficient administration of these support programmes so that the payment process is streamlined and that providers are in a position to meet their financial deadlines.</p></reply>

As a contracting state under the Hague Convention, the Adoption Act 2010 provides that adoptions by Irish prospective adoptive parents may be made subject to Irish and Indian requirements being satisfied in line with relevant laws and the provisions of the Hague Convention. </p><p>  It is a matter for contacting states whether they wish to impose restrictions on whether and how intercountry adoptions of citizens of that State may be effected.  In this regard, the Authority advises that there remains a general moratorium by the Indian Central Authority (CARA) on India accepting adoption applications from other countries other than in special circumstances.  The Authority  has recently received an announcement from CARA that India is currently accepting packs from non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parents for the adoption of Indian children (normal category).  This means that India remains closed to non-Indian prospective adoptive parents at this time in respect of its normal categories of children.  The Adoption Authority understands that CARA is accepting applications in respect of special needs children, which includes children over five years of age and sibling groups.  The Authority is currently attempting to establish from CARA a possible time frame for the acceptance of application packs in the 'normal' category from non-Indian nationals. </p><p>  The Adoption Authority has advised it is their position that it is necessary to have an Irish registered accredited body to facilitate intercountry adoptions from India in order to safeguard the process for the child and the adoptive parents.  The Authority has two applications for India from Irish agencies which are being considered.  Any accreditation being considered by the Authority can only apply to the Indian Special Needs Programme at this time.  The accreditation of agencies to facilitate adoptions is solely a matter for the Adoption Authority under law.  I have raised with the Adoption Authority the likely timescale of reaching conclusions on these applications and I understand it is intended to finalise the process promptly. </p><p>  Furthermore, the Authority advises that it is the policy of CARA to impose the following age limits and age differentials.

My Department is working closely with the Local Authorities, and the network of Play and Recreation Officers within them, to support the implementation of the national play and recreation policies, Ready Steady Play and Teenspace, National Recreation Policy for Young People.  This includes the provision of funding for a National Play Day and a National Recreation Week, at a cost of &euro;78,000 per year.</p><p>  In 2013 I allocated &euro;250,000 under the Play and Recreation Capital Scheme, to support new and existing play and recreation facilities for children and young people.  Local Authorities were invited to apply for a maximum grant of &euro;50,000, for one or more new innovative play and recreation projects.  A commitment from successful Local Authority applicants to provide matching funding was a requirement of the grant scheme.  This amount of funding will be made available again in 2014.  My Department is currently working with the Local Area Network for Play and Recreation (LANPR), which I launched in 2012, to review existing policies and funding schemes.</p><p>  While consideration of grant applications in 2013 took into account areas where no facilities existed or where play and recreation facilities were in need of refurbishment, the location of playgrounds is a matter for individual local authorities.</p></reply>

From birth, children depend on parents and family to protect and provide for their needs.  Sometimes parents need help, support and additional resources to do this.  Family Support Services provide a flexible programme of interventions which are provided through a broad range of skilled personnel, including Family Support Workers, Project Workers, Co-ordinators and Youth Workers.</p><p>  The new Child &amp;amp; Family Agency brings together family support services previously delivered by two agencies, the HSE and the Family Support Agency.  The establishment of the agency means that for the first time, this service will be provided under one roof and this should ensure the provision of a more integrated service to families that require such support.  The Child &amp;amp; Family Agency employs 24.77 whole-time equivalent Family Support Workers in North Dublin who work in partnership with the voluntary sector to provide a multifaceted service which supports parents, guardians and carers to sustain the care of their children within the home setting by engaging with them to meet their changing needs through the use of consultation, plans, reviews and feedback.  This model of support has been developed under the National Service Delivery Framework which is at an advanced stage of implementation in the North Dublin area.</p><p>  My Department is leading the Children's Services Committees Initiative for national and local inter-agency working to improve outcomes for children and young people.  The purpose is to secure better developmental outcomes for children and young people through more effective integration of policies and services.  It is planned to introduce the Partnership, Prevention and Family Support pillar of the Service Delivery Framework in North Dublin this year in conjunction with partner agencies through Fingal Children's Services Committee.</p><p>  A number of priority objectives for 2014 have been identified which will inform future service developments in the area of family support, such as:</p><p>- The development of a strategy for Family Support and parenting to complement my Department's National Policy Framework.</p><p>- The alignment of the Family Resource Centres with the overall Agency approach to prevention and early intervention.</p><p>- A quality review of the implementation of family support processes in each area as well as the integration of Family Resource Centres within the Service Delivery Framework; and</p><p>- The introduction of Meitheal, the National Practice Model for all Agencies working with children and young people.</p></reply>

The software has been significantly developed and improved over the intervening period by the suppliers and previous versions have been replaced with the upgraded version within the HSE. </p><p>  The software used by the HSE dental service in Donegal and in Sligo-Leitrim is EXACT, which is supplied by Software of Excellence.

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her dependants. The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  While there is no legal basis for the HSE to award medical cards on the basis of a specific medical condition, the HSE has, however, discretion to grant a medical card in certain circumstances. If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds, set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances (medical or social), which might result in undue financial hardship in the arranging of medical services. Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot arrange GP services for themselves and their family without undue financial hardship. </p><p>  Discretion must be exercised by the HSE but the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service, having regard to his or her means.

These are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. </p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all emergency cards are issued on the basis that the patent is eligible for a medical card on means or undue hardship and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months. There are no proposals to change these processes.</p></reply>

The Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care, which are:-</p><p>  - nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,</p><p>  - bed and board,</p><p>  - basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living, and</p><p>  - laundry service.</p><p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home. Incontinence wear, where required, is provided free of charge by the HSE to all Nursing Homes Support Scheme residents that possess a Medical Card.</p><p>  Part 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.</p><p>  The HSE is not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p><p>  All nursing homes must register with the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and comply with the conditions and requirements laid down by HIQA in this context. Fees are payable by operators for initial application for registration, for variation or removal of any conditions of registration, and an annual fee is also payable by each registered provider. </p><p>  As stated earlier, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care, for which no additional charges should be levied on residents. As compliance with HIQA requirements, including payment of appropriate fees, is mandatory for all operators providing even these standard components of nursing home care, it is not clear how an additional charge for residents based on standard HIQA fees can be justified. </p><p>  Furthermore, under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) negotiates the price for long-term residential care with private nursing home owners on behalf of the State. In the course of its negotiations, the NTPF factors in the fees associated with the registration and inspection of nursing homes as part of the reasonable day to day running costs associated with the provision of long-term residential care services.</p></reply>

PRCS management clarified the process by which the assessment of medical card applications is undertaken and the granting of eligibility under the Medical Card Scheme.

The condition occurs because of a deficiency of the C1 inhibitor protein required to control the systems in the blood that fight against infection and cause inflammation.  Patients with low levels of this protein have excessive activity of these two systems, which leads to the symptoms of angioedema.  </p><p>  There are authorised medicines for emergency treatment of acute attacks and for the prevention of attacks.  These are <b>Cinryze</b> (C1 inhibitor, a protein extracted from human blood), authorised in 2011, <b>Ruconest </b>(conestat alfa) authorised in 2010, and <b>Firazyr</b> (icatibant) authorised in 2008.  These products are centrally authorised by the European Medicines Agency and the same summary of product characteristics (SmPC) applies in all member states.</p><p>  As these products are centrally-authorised, the method of sale and supply via prescription is the same throughout Europe.  The information for the healthcare professional for Cinryze and Firazyr allows for patients to be trained to give themselves an injection when needed.  They can also obtain emergency supplies from a pharmacist under the relevant legislation.</p></reply>

While no specific rare disease is mentioned, the Council decision declared that it is estimated that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 rare diseases; and hence it states that the specificities of rare diseases are:</p><p>-  A limited number of patients and; </p><p>-  A scarcity of relevant knowledge and expertise.</p><p>  The council's decision recognised these specificities when it recommended that member states adopt a plan to guide actions in the general field of rare diseases.  It is with this in mind that my Department is finalising a generic plan to apply to the 8,000 rare diseases estimated to exist. </p><p>  The HSE has established a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases (NCPRD); a National Clinical Lead has been appointed and a programme manager is in place.

The Government is providing funding of &euro;1.4 billion to the Disability Services Programme in 2014, including an additional &euro;14m to address the priority needs identified by the Minister for Health and advised to the Health Service Executive (HSE). The additional funding includes &euro;7m for the provision of new places for school-leavers and rehabilitative (life-skills) training graduates. </p><p>  The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, is working with schools, service providers, young people and their families to identify training needs and explore suitable options for school-leavers graduating in 2014. Many young people with disabilities will progress to further education or vocational training funded by the Department of Education and Skills. For those young people who will require ongoing HSE-funded supports, the HSE has established a National Oversight Group to coordinate a timely response to processing applications for day services and rehabilitative training places. As a result, new arrangements have been put in place for a centralised regional application process. </p><p>  The HSE have informed me that they are liaising with disability agencies and the National Council for Special Education to supply the necessary information to parents and students on the new application process.  The deadline for applications was the 1st of February, however some flexibility will be given since the application process is in its first year.  The next stage in the process will be to identify and agree the supports required for each individual, identify the service providers who have the capacity to respond to those support needs, and agree the allocation of additional resources to support individual placements. A communications process with all stakeholders will be put in place by the end of March, and young people and their parents will be advised of the placement which will be available to them by the end of June 2014. </p><p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Drugs policy encompasses five pillars - supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research and clear actions are in place for implementation.  I am satisfied that good progress is being made across the actions of the Strategy, with the involvement of the statutory, voluntary and community  sectors, and that emerging issues and threats around problem drug use are being addressed in a timely and effective manner.  </p><p>  In the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy particular focus is being placed on Programme for Government commitments in areas such as treatment and rehabilitation.  Periodic reviews of progress across the pillars of the Strategy are carried out through the Oversight Forum on Drugs (OFD) which I chair and these are posted on my Department's website.   Considerable success has been achieved with an increased number of people in the opiate substitution programme,  a reduction in waiting times for access to services particularly outside the Dublin area, increased availability of  places in rehabilitation programmes as well as the continued expansion of the pharmacy needle exchange programme. This work is being complemented by greater focus on integrated care plans for individuals and more co-ordinated inter-agency working with the national roll out of the National Drugs Rehabilitation Framework planned following the successful piloting of the initiative.    </p><p>  In relation to alcohol the Government recently approved an extensive package of measures to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol)Bill which are based on the recommendations contained in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy 2012.  The HSE has responsibility for implementing a number of recommendations and this is reflected in the HSE Service Plan for 2014.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). </p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable harm and increased healthcare costs. </p><p>  The prevalence of MRSA has dropped considerably in recent years.  There has been a decrease of 59% in reported cases of MRSA from 2006 to 2012.  Provisional data for the first three quarters of 2013 indicates that the reduced rates are holding (see table below).</p><p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collates information from hospitals on healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistant organisms such as MRSA.  Information is also published on an ongoing basis for overall <i> S. aureus</i>  blood stream infections (BSI) and MRSA infection within that grouping &ndash; published quarterly to hospital level since 2007.  Detailed information on MRSA rates per hospital is available on the HPSC website (www.hpsc.ie).  </p><p>  Notably, there has been a decrease in reported <i>S. </i>aureus BSI from 1,412 cases in 2006 to 1,060 cases in 2012 (24.9% decrease).  The decrease in MRSA cases as a percentage of overall bloodstream infections saw a greater decrease in this time however - a reduction from 41.9% in 2006 to 22.8% in 2012 (last full year statistics to date).  To the end of Quarter 3 2013, (provisional) 180 (21.3%) of overall BSI cases were due to resistant <i>S. aureus</i>  (MRSA) and in actual cases of MRSA reported, a 59% drop was observed:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. of MRSA cases</th><th>Decrease</th></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>592</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>536</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>439</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>355</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>305</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>263</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>242</td><td>59% decrease on 2006 figures </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>180*</td><td>* Data provisional to the end of Q3 2013</td></tr></table></p><p>  While not all HCAIs are due to AMR a significant proportion are.  HCAIs are not an inevitable consequence of healthcare - recent evidence suggests that up to 70% of HCAIs can be prevented depending on the type of infection and the baseline rate.  The approach to prevention and control of HCAIs is similar irrespective of whether or not it is caused by an antibiotic resistant bacteria.  Therefore, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a dual focus:</p><p>- implementing measures to prevent and control HCAIs including those caused by AMR such as MRSA</p><p>- implementing specific measures for AMR including  MRSA:</p><p>- These are outlined in national guidelines which have been recently updated </p><p>- Monitoring infections caused by AMR as outlined later in this response.</p><p>  The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in this field for many years, including:</p><p>- SARI 2001-2010 (The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland)  which specifically outlined the national strategy for prevention of AMR and was launched by the Minister of Health in 2001.</p><p>- HSE &lsquo; Say No to Infection&rsquo; which focused on both HCAIs and AMR, launched in 2007</p><p>- The RCPI &amp;amp; HSE National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010.</p><p>  Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals: </p><p>- HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012</p><p>-  <i>S. aureus </i>  bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital</p><p>- Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)</p><p>- Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)</p><p>- Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)</p><p>  The overall aim of the National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is that every healthcare worker and all parts of the healthcare system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance. Our healthcare systems have processes in place to ensure safe healthcare is reliably delivered irrespective of the healthcare setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients, these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e., IV lines/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients/residents/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented. </p><p>  While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland, MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland. </p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's question about the number of deaths that have been linked to MRSA, routine data is not available on deaths from hospital acquired infections (HCAIs). In certain cases such infections may be a contributing factor to a particular death but not the primary cause, hence the difficulty in giving definitive statistics on the issue.</p><p>  In December last I launched and endorsed the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>  (MRSA).   This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes/long stay residential units and the community.  </p><p>  I might add that I have ensured that Patient Safety has been made a priority within the HSE's Annual Service Plan through specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including HCAIs, Medication safety and implementation of Early Warning Score systems.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.</p></reply>

I want to make it attractive for frontline staff to continue their careers in Ireland and initiatives are in train to support retention.</p><p>  NCHD recruitment and retention is required in order to support service delivery, to address reliance on agency and to facilitate the achievement of the European Working Time Directive compliance.  I set up the MacCraith Group to undertake a Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career structure last Summer.  The Group is to make recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system, planning for future service needs and achieving the maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.  The Group provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focusing on training and is now examining career structures and pathways following training with a view to preparing a report by the end of March 2014.  It will provide the final report by the end of June 2014.</p><p>  In relation to nursing staff, up to 1,000 two-year contracts are being made available to graduate nurses and midwives in our health services under the Graduate Nurse/Midwifery Programme.  The scheme will support the retention of graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enable them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  Participants will have access to a variety of care settings while gaining clinical experience.</p><p>  A Support Staff Intern Scheme also allows for the recruitment of a similar number of staff.  The scheme also facilitates the intern achieving the appropriate FETAC level 5 qualification, which will be an invaluable asset in their professional development. </p><p>  The HSE has advised me that both schemes have received a large number of applicants and I am satisfied that they will achieve their objectives of reducing agency costs and affording graduates and interns valuable work experience and career development opportunities.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of providing bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus-based public transport.  Bicycles and taxis are also permitted to use bus lanes. </p><p>  Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate public hire services, an exemption to allow for their operation in bus lanes, when they are being used in the course of business, was provided.  It remains my opinion that to extend the use of bus lanes to other categories of vehicles will serve to undermine their original purpose and I have no plans to amend the current policy.</p></reply>

My officials are continuing to engage with the UK Department for Transport on this matter.  Any support that the Northern Irish Executive or individual Ministers of the Executive can bring to bear on the UK Government to ensure that there is an exemption for the A5 would of course be welcomed.</p></reply>

However the key issue on which all sides must remain focused on is the resolution of the problems of the IASS rather than about any contingency planning as it is clear that any strike would be highly disruptive to the country and would inconvenience passengers.  A strike would also damage the financial position of the companies which will ultimately, along with the Scheme members, have to contribute to the resolution to the problems of the Scheme.</p><p>  Now that the Trustees have issued their proposals, I understand that meetings between various parties are currently being arranged.  I welcome this initiative.  The problems with the IASS are recognised and must now be resolved.  While difficult decisions will be required, there is nevertheless an opportunity to finally bring this challenging issue to a conclusion.  I urge all parties to again engage, utilising the State&rsquo;s labour relations machinery where necessary.</p></reply>

The Directive allows Member States freedom to test cars more frequently.  With effect from 1 June 2011 annual testing was introduced for cars 10 years and older.  NCT due dates are calculated by reference to the date of first registration.</p><p>  In the 12 month period from October 2011 to September 2012 the pass rate at NCT for four year old cars was 76% and for 10 year old cars was 41%.  The average pass rate for cars 10 years and older was 32.5%. The effects of wear and tear on a vehicle become more evident as it gets older and even a vehicle that is not driven, or driven very little, will deteriorate over time with a potential impact on safety.</p><p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the roadworthiness testing requirements in regard to low mileage cars.</p></reply>

As you will appreciate, there are significant constraints on my Department's overall capital budget and there are other capital demands arising from my primary responsibility to provide a marine emergency response service.</p><p>  At present, my Department is continuing with the grant aid scheme to assist  a range of  current expenditures by  both Mountain Rescue Ireland and the various teams nationwide. The  scope for capital grant assistance is being considered but it may  be some time later this year before it can be established whether there is any capital funding available in my Department&rsquo;s budget that could be utilised for mountain rescue services.  Mountain Rescue Ireland were made aware of this position when I met with them and discussed the matter at their recent national conference.</p></reply>
