Those discussions have commenced today, and I am sure that the Deputy will understand, in the circumstances, my reluctance to seem to be engaging in any negotiations in public. Further formal discussions will take place over the coming weeks and, although obviously I am not in a position to predict when the talks will conclude, early agreement will facilitate assignment of resources and budgetary planning in respect of 2016 and beyond.   </p>  <p>  The Government considers that any pay agreement should be prudent, modest and sustainable in the overall budgetary context as now set out in the Spring Economic Statement. Through the  HRA and its predecessor the Croke Park Agreement, together with the FEMPI legislation, public servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery of the State including by way of  direct reductions in pay and pensions.  I want to make it clear that all public servants from the lowest paid to the highest have contributed. From 2009 to 2014 the cost to the Exchequer of public service pay was reduced by &euro;3.7 billion, or more than 21%.  Notwithstanding our improving economy, because of the magnitude of these reductions, the Exchequer could not sustain the immediate restoration of such reductions.  I have stated previously that there need to be realistic expectations, on both sides, regarding what can be achieved in the forthcoming talks' process. The HRA reiterates the commitment to give priority to those public servants on salaries of less than &euro;35,000 p.a.  </p>  <p>  Public Servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery through a number of productivity measures.  Without this productivity contribution, we would not be in a position to discuss any element of the unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures legislation.  Reform is now a constant part of employment for public servants and is a central element of my strategy to deliver a public service that will, in turn, deliver improved outcomes for all stakeholders, including the business sector and citizens.  My intention is that any agreement reached will maintain and build upon the productivity and other reforms delivered through earlier Agreements including the Haddington Road Agreement and secure an Industrial Relations framework that will foster and support further productivity and change at the level of the workplace. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-12a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200052#WRA01600"><p>The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, in 2012 introduced the Community Involvement Initiative and, through public advertisement and publicity, sought applications from interested groups to  participate.  The objective of this project was to harness the enthusiasm for heritage in local communities around the country and to work with them to develop a capacity to present certain Heritage sites to the public at times when the OPW is not in a position to do so because of resource limitations or other constraints.</p>  <p>  The OPW is responsible for the management and presentation of a large number of National Monuments in State care and some of these locations are among the best-known visitor destinations in the country.  However, there are also a considerable number of sites where it is not possible to maintain a Guide service to present sites to visitors and it is in these cases where the Initiative sought to improve the position.</p>  <p>  While the initial response to the Initiative was quite strong, with approx 100 groups applying, it was also apparent that there was a great deal of work involved in making sure that groups understand what is involved and the challenges posed in managing visitor sites.  The OPW worked directly with approx 30 of the initial applicants to refine their proposals and to prepare them for the challenge.  Contact is still maintained in many of these cases.  </p>  <p>  The Initiative was re-branded as the &ldquo;Friends of Irish Heritage&rdquo; in 2013 and again advertised.  This did not result in any new substantial projects. </p>  <p>  It is apparent from the experience to date that, while many local partners are prepared to engage with the project in its initial stage, and indeed a number of successful projects resulted, the commitment involved in bringing a project to fruition and to encouraging the development of a broadly-based movement of volunteer guide groups all around the country is a project that requires more work and a long term sustained commitment.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not apply a universally generic approach to this issue and remains very open to suggestions about partnering with local communities in a variety of ways.  It is ever mindful that, in many instances, it was the intervention and continuing contribution of these local communities that contributed significantly to the preservation of many of our Monuments.  The tourism sector continues to be one of the main drivers behind Ireland's economic recovery and I am pleased that the OPW continues to engage in partnering with local communities and heritage groups to develop local tourism initiatives.</p></reply>

In this regard,  a space audit of the State owned Government Offices on the Abbeyleix Road in Portlaoise is currently being undertaken. When this is complete, it will be evaluated to establish the potential to increase the occupancy of the building through the re-configuration of the space with a more modern open plan layout and furniture.</p>  <p>  The provision of an extension to this State owned property will also be reviewed following completion of the space audit. The use of leased premises may prove part of the final proposals for the long term accommodation solution for DAFM. </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection's accommodation in Portlaoise was not part of the Decentralisation Programme. They are currently in two locations in the town, the State Owned Government Offices on the Abbeyleix Road and a leased property and their current accommodation requirements are adequately provided for.</p></reply>

In implementing expenditure reductions the Government was conscious of the need to balance the requirement to return the public finances to stability with creating the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth and job creation.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, the Government was in a position to implement targeted increases in expenditure while at the same time achieving the fiscal target of a general government deficit below 3% of GDP required to ensure our successful exit from the Excessive Deficit Procedure. </p>  <p>  The intervening period since Budget 2015 has seen the economic recovery continue to broaden out, with domestic demand increasingly contributing to economic growth. As outlined in the Spring Economic Statement (SES) a number of key economic and fiscal variables have been revised, with the combined effect of these changes lowering our forecast deficit in 2015 to 2.3%.</p>  <p>  The SES has outlined fiscal space of between &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion for 2016, of which &euro;600 million to &euro;750 million will be directed towards expenditure increases . This will allow demographic pressures in key areas to be addressed and allow for new measures to further enhance public services.</p>  <p>  As the economy continues to recover we will look to build upon the significant and wide-ranging public service reforms implemented over recent years.

Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they are prepared to accept on a case by case basis.  Any question of ensuring that home owners can access flood insurance would be a matter for the Minister for Finance. </p>  <p>  The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Office of Public Works and Insurance Ireland, which was signed on 24th March 2014, outlines the principles of agreement between the parties on the provision of information to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  The Office of Public Works is committed to providing Insurance Ireland with data on all completed OPW flood defence schemes showing the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Insurance Ireland members will then take into account all information provided by the OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p>  <p>  To date, the OPW has provided the Insurance sector with details of 16 completed flood relief schemes. Under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme detailed flood hazard maps for 300 at risk communities throughout the country are being produced which, following public consultation, will be made available publicly leading to the finalisation of the maps and the development of draft Catchment Flood Risk Management Plans.  These Plans will include an examination of all possible options to address the flood risk in the locations in question and will recommend an integrated set of measures, both structural and non-structural, as appropriate, to deal with and manage the risk. Information on the structural measures arising from the CFRAM programme will be provided to the Insurance industry in accordance with the MoU.</p></reply>

However, there are also a considerable number of sites where it is not possible to maintain a Guide service to present sites to visitors and it is in these cases where the Initiative sought to improve the position.</p>  <p>  While the initial response to the Initiative was quite strong, with approx 100 groups applying, it was also apparent that there was a great deal of work involved in making sure that groups understand what is involved and the challenges posed in managing visitor sites.  The OPW worked directly with approx 30 of the initial applicants to refine their proposals and to prepare them for the challenge.  Contact is still maintained in many of these cases.  </p>  <p>  The Initiative was re-branded as the &ldquo;Friends of Irish Heritage&rdquo; in 2013 and again advertised.  This did not result in any new substantial projects. </p>  <p>  It is apparent from the experience to date that, while many local partners are prepared to engage with the project in its initial stage, and indeed a number of successful projects resulted, the commitment involved in bringing a project to fruition and to encouraging the development of a broadly-based movement of volunteer guide groups all around the country is a project that requires more work and a long term sustained commitment.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not apply a universally generic approach to this issue and remains very open to suggestions about partnering with local communities in a variety of ways.  It is aware that, in many instances, it was the intervention and continuing contribution of these local communities that contributed significantly to the preservation of many of our Monuments.  The tourism sector continues to be one of the main drivers behind Ireland's economic recovery and I am pleased that the OPW continues to engage in partnering with local communities and heritage groups to develop local tourism initiatives.</p></reply>

The appropriateness of including social  clauses in procurement projects will vary from contract to contract and they are likely to be most suited to works and services contracts.  It is therefore important that any policy instrument that is developed affords the State the necessary flexibility to design social clauses that are relevant to the needs of a specific contract and do not disadvantage the wider economy.</p>  <p>  It was with this in mind in June of last year that I established a Social Clauses Project Group to proactively look at projects which might be suitable for inclusion of social clauses aimed at the long term unemployed and/or apprentices.  The group has been working with the various procuring sectors and has identified 11 projects which will be used to test the inclusion of social clauses in tender and contract documentation.</p>  <p>  In addition to this initiative, I would also like to point to another initiative on social clauses - the Devolved Schools Programme - which is being administered by the NDFA on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  This pilot project has sought to introduce social clauses in three contracts covering fourteen sites comprising both stand-alone, new build and extensions/refurbishment works.  I understand that reporting from the three main contractors to the NDFA indicates that the initiative has resulted to date in the hiring of 50 employees who had been unemployed for more than 12 months and a further 18 apprentices/trainees.</p>  <p>  Overall, it is important to learn from the practical experience of the pilot projects outlined above on how social clauses can be effectively used as well as from the practical experience of their use in other jurisdictions.  The Government believes that further debate and discussion is required as to the correct policy approach regarding enabling social clauses, mindful of course of the need to maintain flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.</p></reply>

Those discussions have commenced today, and I am sure that the Deputy will understand, in the circumstances, my reluctance to seem to engage in any negotiations in public. When the economic crisis determined that further reductions were required of public servants in 2013, the Haddington Road Agreement was secured by negotiation and discussion with the representatives of those directly affected. I believe a similar approach in the current circumstances is also appropriate.</p>  <p>  Further formal discussions will take place over the coming weeks and, although I am not in a position to predict when the talks will conclude, early agreement will facilitate assignment of resources and budgetary planning in respect of 2016 and beyond.</p>  <p>  The Government considers that any pay agreement should be prudent, modest and sustainable in the overall budgetary context which has now been set out in the Spring Economic Statement. Through the  Haddington Road Agreement (HRA) and its predecessor the Croke Park Agreement, together with the FEMPI legislation, public servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery of the State including by way of  direct reductions in pay and pensions.  From 2009 to 2014 the cost to the Exchequer of public service pay was reduced by &euro;3.7 billion, or more than 21%.  Notwithstanding our improving economy, because of the magnitude of these reductions, the Exchequer could not sustain the immediate restoration of such reductions.  I have stated previously that there need to be realistic expectations, on both sides, regarding what can be achieved in the forthcoming talks process.</p>  <p>  The end of the period of acute financial emergency which necessitated the introduction of the FEMPI legislation by the previous Government is now in sight because of the actions of this Government.  Planning for the orderly wind down of this legislation in an agreed and sustainable process, rather than risking a successful legal challenge, is the appropriate and prudent approach.  But I am conscious that 2015 will be the seventh successive year in which no pay increases will be made to public servants while they have suffered at least two and in some cases three pay reductions over that period.</p>  <p>  I expect that all sides to these discussions will meet with the aim and intention of making an agreement that is fair to all involved, those who avail of public services, employers, and public servants themselves, and an agreement that sustains the continuing economic recovery.</p></reply>

In doing so, through training and other measures, the RDO aims to ensure that the appropriate governance structures are in place so that barriers to reforms can be identified and adequately addressed.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Civil Service Renewal Plan published last October provides for the establishment of a Civil Service Management Board compromising of Secretaries General from all Departments and heads of all major Offices. The Civil Service Management Board has collective responsibility for the implementation of the Civil Service Renewal Plan.</p>  <p>  As regards expenditure management, among the key reforms introduced by this Government, and one which allows us to identify expenditure pressures and priorities over multiple years, are the periodic reviews of which ensure that resources are used in the most effective and efficient manner. The most recent review was carried out in 2014 and included an examination of cross-cutting issues by the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit in my Department. These reports are available on the Department's website.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has greatly enhanced the role of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann's Select Committees through the implementation of a whole-of-year budgeting process which ensures that the Ministerial expenditure allocations and their expected outputs are effectively scrutinised.</p>  <p>  Overall, the reforms put in place over the past 4 years have enabled us to maintain and improve public services, in spite of the considerable fiscal constraints facing us during this period.</p></reply>

This included such steps as the introduction of a Pre-Legislative Stage for Bills before an Oireachtas Committee, so that members can review the Heads of a Bill and issue a Report before the Bill is published, and the introduction of a system of dedicated D&aacute;il time to enable TDs to play a fuller role in the legislative process by introducing their own Bills and having those Bills debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  These sittings, on a Friday, were introduced in 2011 for one sitting day a month to debate a single Private Member's Bill and had to be expanded in 2013. so that the D&aacute;il now sits every second Friday during term. The D&aacute;il debates two Private Member's Bills on the first such Friday and one Private Member's Bill and an Oireachtas Committee Report on the second.</p>  <p>  This has encouraged a rapid growth in the number of members introducing their own Bills, from 14 Private Member's Bills published by members in 2010 to 53 published in 2014.</p>  <p>  A total of 28 Private Member Bill's have passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il since the current D&aacute;il was elected in 2011. A total of 19 Seanad Private Member's Bills have passed Second Stage.</p>  <p>  Among the Bills that have been passed at Second Stage in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il some have been enacted either under their own title or merged with another Bill, or have been withdrawn in favour of a Bill introduced on the issue by the relevant Minister.</p>  <p>  The Construction Contractors Act 2013 and the Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Act 2014 both started as Private Member's Bills.</p>  <p>  The Advanced Health Care Decision Bill 2012 was a Private Member's Bill which passed Second Stage and was sent to Committee. This Bill was incorporated into the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, which is currently before the Oireachtas Justice Committee.</p>  <p>  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2011 was a Private Member's Bill to put in place a system to designate bodies which may register members to solemnise marriages and was passed in the Seanad.  It was influential in the enactment the following year of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2012</p></reply>

A person wishing to pursue a course of study under BTEA must satisfy a number of conditions such as age, in receipt of a qualifying payment, in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specified period of time amongst others.  The allowance can be paid to cover a range of courses that are classified by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skill as a full-time.  Masters Courses are not eligible for income support under BTEA with the exception of the Professional Masters of Education (Primary and Secondary School Teaching) or where access to study a Masters has been granted by a third level institution solely on the basis life experience in the absence of any other formal qualification.  BTEA is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the education system.  </p>  <p>  A person in receipt of a social welfare payment may receive student grant support from Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI).  Grant payments from SUSI will generally be regarded as income for the purposes of means test associated with the particular social welfare payment, such as in the case of jobseekers allowance payments.  Claimants under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes are required to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work and accordingly these schemes are not available to persons engaged in full-time courses of education.  An exception applies to recipients of the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment who are exempt from the conditionality and are allowed to engage in full-time courses of education while they are in receipt of the payment. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-12a.105.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200054#WRC01000"><p>The existence of the State pension (transition) is historical and relates to the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) which, up until the early 1970s, was 70 years of age. State pension transition (known then as the Retirement Pension) was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65. The qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years, which left State pension (transition) effective for just one year. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years. State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement. The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present. The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change. This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  In 2013, despite reforms introduced in 2012, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million, and further increases are required year-on-year to keep pace with this demographic change. </p>  <p>  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical to protect older people from poverty.  Following on from its analysis of its award figures for State pension (transition) in 2011 and 2012 in order to establish the impact of the abolition of State pension (transition), the Department noted that only approximately 12.5 % came from employment, with over 50% coming from another social welfare payment, and the remainder coming from a combination of people already retired, paying credits or self-employed.  This would indicate that a significant number of people have left employment well in advance of pension age.  It also reflects the fact that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland. Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  As a result, people can retire before or after State pension age. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137.27 million. It is estimated that the net saving resulting from its abolition, when taking into account that many people were instead in receipt of other payments at the lower rates applicable to those under 66, amounted to &euro;33.5m in 2014 (as the scheme wound down over the 12 months) and will amount to some &euro;66 million in 2015.  There is also the impact of the additional PRSI and tax paid by those people choosing to work 12 months longer as a result of its abolition, and so the net cost to the Exchequer and Social Insurance Fund would be very significant if it was re-introduced.</p>  <p>  The average weekly payment of the State pension (transition) in 2013 amounted to &euro;235, although this varied depending on the circumstances of the pensioner.  The maximum personal rate was &euro;230.30, the increase for a Qualified Adult was &euro;153.50 (under 65) or &euro;206.30 (65 or over), and qualified children attracted an increase of &euro;29.80 each.</p>  <p>  It is hoped that, where appropriate, workers will choose and be able to work to pension age (and beyond if that is there choice) and in such cases they will have a higher income than they would have from their pension.  However, it is recognised that for some this is not viable and there are measures to support them in such circumstances. All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The rate of such payments will vary from case to case, depending on the scheme they are paid under, and their dependants.  For example, the personal rate for jobseekers benefit is &euro;188, with an increase of &euro;124.80 for a Qualified Adult and &euro;29.80 for qualified children.</p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance, there are a number of transitioning provisions applying in the case of people who are aged between 65 and 66. These include the following &ndash;</p>  <p>  (a)  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  </p>  <p>  (b)  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year).</p>  <p>  (c)  A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of JB within the past year.</p>  <p>  Beyond the above measures, there are no plans to introduce a new payment as the demographic reasons for the change remain.  Social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p></reply>

The increase in State pension contributory expenditure reflects changing demographics with older people living longer.  The number of State pension contributory recipients at the end of 2013 was 329,531 and this number is increasing by approximately 17,000 each year.  </p><p>State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested payment, funded directly from the Exchequer, rather than the SIF and there are no corresponding projections.  In addition to the variables such as demographic change, it is also impacted by other factors such as &ndash;</p><p>-  Social Insurance coverage (increases in this result in higher numbers qualifying for the contributory pension, thereby reducing the number of non-contributory pensioners)</p><p>-  Private pension coverage (again, increased coverage would be expected to reduce pressures on the non-contributory pension)</p><p>-  General economic trends, which are likely to increase or decrease the means available to those over 66, thereby impacting on the numbers who qualify for non-contributory pensions.</p><p>The widening of the applicability of PRSI in recent decades has seen a small downward trend in the non-contributory pension.  In 2009, the cost of this payment amounted to &euro;1.0 billion (97,798 recipients), whereas by 2013 this had declined to &euro;952 million (95,801 recipients), and this reduction is expected to continue as the numbers qualifying for the contributory pension increases. It is, of course, significantly less than the increase in the State pension (contributory).</p><p>The increase in the expenditure projected for the contributory pension would be expected to increase future shortfalls in the SIF, and in time become unsustainable without pension reform.  In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, a number of significant reforms to State pensions have been introduced in recent years:</p><p>-  The standardisation of State pension age to age 66 began in 2014.  While the current State pension age of 66 remains, the State pension (transition) which applied for one year, for persons of age 65, ceased from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2014.</p><p>-  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p><p>-  With effect from April 2012, and as provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.</p><p>-  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p><p>Following considerable policy analysis, it is planned to introduce a &lsquo;total contribution approach&rsquo;.  Under this reform, the level of state pension (contributory) paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change.  However, it is planned to finalise details and publicise them well in advance of its introduction, to facilitate retirement planning by those workers who may be affected by this change.</p></reply>

This is normally a very quick process with the submitted dockets scanned onto the Department&rsquo;s computer system and the relevant payment calculated and issued.</p>  <p>  I recognise these arrangements can cause difficulties in a small number of cases and, in these circumstances, alternative arrangements can be put in place such as the acceptance of a signature from the employer&rsquo;s local representative (e.g. a local supervisor or manager).

The Government has provided &euro;44.3 million for the scheme in 2015. </p>  <p>  BSCFA was paid in respect of approximately 304,400 children with a total expenditure of circa &euro;42.5 million in 2014, in respect of approximately 324,000 children in 2013 at a cost of &euro;48 million, and in respect of approximately 340,000 children in 2012 at a cost of &euro;65.7 million. </p>  <p>  In general, the allowance is payable in respect of eligible children between the ages of 4 and 17 in respect of whom a qualified child allowance is being paid and eligible children between the ages of 18 and 22 who are in full-time second level education and in respect of whom a qualified child allowance is being paid.  To qualify for BSCFA a person must meet a number of conditions namely:</p>  <p>  -  The child must meet the age criteria,</p>  <p>  -  The applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and getting an increase in that payment for the qualified child (except in certain circumstances),</p>  <p>  -  The assessable income for the household must be within prescribed limits,</p>  <p>  -  The applicant and the child (or children) in respect of whom the allowance is claimed must be resident in the State.</p>  <p>  In recent years payments of BSCFA have been automated to a substantial number of qualified persons who are not required to apply for the payment.  In 2014, over 112,800 (68%) of payments were processed through the automated process.  Similar arrangements will be in place for the 2015 scheme.  Customers who do not receive notification of an automated payment are required to complete an application form which will be available by mid-June 2015.</p></reply>

One of the key messages of the review is that rent supplement continues to play a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting 69,000 people this year at a cost of over &euro;298 million.</p><p>Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.  The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients.</p><p>In light of the review's findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers' accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, each tenant's circumstances is considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,500 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation. </p><p>In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork city areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.  Of the 1,500 cases referred to above, some 560 Dublin households were supported as a result of the Protocol and 14 in Cork city.</p><p>The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.  In addition, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty </p><p>I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.</p></reply>

Before the reforms to the scheme, lone parents could have been on the scheme until their youngest child turned 18, or 22 if they were in full-time education. </p>  <p>  This is why I believe that the reforms I have introduced are much needed as they are moving us away from providing passive income support over a long period towards an active, engagement approach. </p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department's range of education, training, and employment supports.  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department's Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future. </p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the forthcoming changes to the one parent family payment. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department regularly brief and meet with lone parent representative groups to discuss the on-going one-parent family payment scheme age change reform process.  With regard to One Family, it should be noted that they have been invited to and attended several information seminars in respect of the forthcoming one-parent family payment reforms.  Furthermore, my Departmental officials are in regular communication with One Family's Information Officer and they have answered all queries that have been submitted to the Department to date.</p>  <p>  My officials will also be meeting with One Family later this month to further discuss the reforms to the one-parent family payment.</p>  <p>  In addition I will meet with One Family as part of the pre-budget consultation.</p></reply>

Recommendations arising out of the Critical Review on the Pensions Authority to be implemented were approved by Government in April 2013 and provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2013.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Pensions Board, the following changes were approved:</p>  <p>  -  Oversight of the then Pensions Board to be undertaken by a three person body called the Pensions Authority consisting of a Chairperson, an official from the Department of Social Protection and an official Department of Finance, replacing the 17 person Board.  This was put in place in early 2014. </p>  <p>  -  The Pensions Board was renamed the Pensions Authority to reflect its key role of safeguarding the pensions of occupational pension scheme members and the provision of information on occupational pensions.</p>  <p>-  A separate unpaid Pensions Council was established to advise me and the Department on matters of pension policy and give consumers greater input.  The Pensions Council was appointed on the 3 February 2015, and its first meeting took place on the 25  March 2015.  Its membership ensures that the relevant skills, knowledge, and experience are available to provide the required advice and information in the development of pensions policy.</p>  <p>  There is no net cost to splitting the functions of the Pensions Board, and there is anticipated to be a small saving as membership of the Pensions Council and the ordinary members of the Board of the Pensions Authority are not remunerated, unlike the previous ordinary members of the Pensions Board.  However, as the Pensions Board was funded by means of a levy on the pensions industry, as are the activities of the Pensions Authority now, no costs or savings arise for the Exchequer.  There was no reduction in staff levels in the Pensions Authority as a result of the approved changes.</p>  <p>  The process of merging the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman is underway.  This work is advancing under an Inter-Departmental Steering Group chaired by the Department of Finance, with the participation of officials from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, and the offices of the two Ombudsmen.  Preparations are being made for the offices to be co-located later this year, and it is hoped that the legislative changes required for a formal merger will be proposed by the Minister for Finance later this year. No significant savings are expected in advance of the full merger.</p></reply>

Evidence of over two years of usage of the new name is required via presentation of two documents such as a driver's licence, a college identification card, a school report, a pay slip, utility bills, bank statements or official correspondence from a public or private sector organisation.</p>  <p>  In some cases, there may be a pressing need to change a name with immediate effect.  This can be executed through a deed poll which is a signed declaration by a person that binds them to a particular course of action from the date of signing.  A deed poll for a change of name contains declarations that a person is abandoning the use of their old name.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement to enrol a deed poll in the Central Office of the High Court in order for the deed poll to have a legal significance.  However, the enrolment of a deed poll in the Central Office places a change of name on a publicly accessible record.  In addition, enrolling the deed poll means that a record of the change of name is preserved for future identification and a certified copy of the original enrolled deed poll can be obtained, if required.</p>  <p>  From the Department's perspective, enrolment in the High Court where a publicly accessible record is preserved provides a level of public proof of the change of name to be acceptable as an alternative to evidence of &ldquo;use and repute&rdquo; over two years.</p></reply>

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.</p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.  Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.  This Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms since the financial crisis towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the Irish financial services sector and to respond to the shortcomings identified.  In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. The reforms introduced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services. Under our presidency, agreement was reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union. Agreement was also reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks. These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels. The Central Bank of Ireland's Enforcement Priorities for 2015 highlight the importance of enforcement within its risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM). PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland. The Central Bank's Strategic Plan 2013 2015 also sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.</p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I have considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and have decided against introducing such relief. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations. Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted. Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted. These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the following information in relation to Revenue issues raised in the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</b>- </p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments. This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders </b>- </p><p>In relation to this proposal I as Minister for Finance remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements -</b>This recommendation has been considered. These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission.

Up until 2018 however, tax relief continues to be available for interest paid on all qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, regardless of whether the individuals concerned are first-time buyers or non-first-time buyers.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008. In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period. This was the period during which house prices peaked. This 30% rate will continue to be applicable to these first-time buyers for the remaining years that mortgage interest relief continues to be available. In the absence of this change the mortgage interest relief available would have gradually reduced to a rate of 15%.</p>  <p>  Single individuals, married couples and civil partners that are first-time buyers, qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively. Thereafter relief is restricted to ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively. </p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans. </p>  <p>  Given the additional relief already available to those that purchased their homes between 2004 and 2008, over and above that available to other qualifying homeowners and given that mortgage interest relief has now lapsed in terms of new qualifying loans, I am not convinced of the merits of revisiting the provisions at this stage.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in Finance Act 2013 to include travel to Nigeria, Senegal, Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Tanzania for 2013 and 2014. </p><p>Following a comprehensive review of the scheme in 2014, a number of amendments were made in the 2014 Finance Act. The scheme was extended up to and including 2017 and changes were made to the qualifying criteria for the scheme.

The Code, however, does not prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates, as this is a commercial decision for the company in question and is generally determined by such issues as higher claims volumes and the nature of the product.</p><p>While the Question does not specify the type of life insurance product taken out, it would appear that you are referring to a type of policy known as a &quot;Whole of Life&quot; policy, which pays a specified amount on death.  &quot;Whole of Life&quot; policies cover the policyholder for their entire lifetime, or for as long as the policyholder wishes to continue to pay premiums. Neither I nor officials from my Department have have held discussions with Insurance Ireland.  However, the Central Bank has previously advised that premiums for such policies are not fixed and can increase over the duration of the policy. &quot;Whole of Life&quot; policies which cover the policyholder for their entire lifetime while the policy is active must be distinguished from &quot;Term Life&quot; insurance policies which cover a fixed period of time such as 10 or 20 years and have a fixed premium unless index linked.</p><p>Most firms state in their current terms and conditions of &quot;Whole of Life&quot; policies that they will carry out regular post sale reviews.  The post-sale policy review will determine if it is likely that the premium currently being paid can maintain the current level of life cover until the next review date.  If it seems likely that the fund value of the policy will not be sufficient to maintain the policy to the next review date, the firm will recommend that the policyholder either increase their premium or reduce the level of life cover provided by the policy.</p><p>Policyholders who feel that the premium increases which have been proposed by their insurer are unfair are advised to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman for adjudication at . </p><p>With regard to concerns that advice given at the point of sale may have been misleading, section 57BX 3(b) of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, provides that a consumer may not make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman if the conduct complained of occurred more than 6 years before the complaint is made. The Financial Services Ombudsman is an independent officer and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in an individual complaint. However, officials in my Department have been informed by the Central Bank that if the consumers have documentary proof that they were given misleading information at the point of sale or at any time since then, this should be forwarded to the Central Bank of Ireland at:</p><p>Consumer Protection Codes DivisionCentral Bank of IrelandPO Box 91386 / 8 College Green  Dublin 2 </p></reply>

This themed inspection is building on project work already carried out by the Central Bank on mortgage arrears, including the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies (MARS) project; Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) audits; the revision of the CCMA in 2013; the Revised CCMA Implementation themed review, which included on-site visits; and CEO engagements on mortgage arrears, as well as on-going supervisory engagement with individual lenders.   </p>  <p>  This current themed inspection commenced in quarter four of 2014 and includes on site inspections of a number of regulated mortgage lenders to examine the processes in place around certain provisions of the CCMA and the controls lenders have in place to ensure compliance with those processes and the CCMA.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it plans to publish the results of this inspection at the end of the first half of 2015 and I look forward to this publication.</p></reply>

As a result of this meeting the Governor is currently reviewing the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders. The Central Bank submitted the report to my Department yesterday and I am considering the contents.  I have also arranged to meet the six principal Mortgage Lenders in order to discuss this issue. </p>  <p>  The lending institutions in Ireland - including those in which the State has a significant shareholding - are independent commercial entities. I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. </p>  <p>  Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. However, if the Central Bank propose to me that they should get control of  the regulation of interest rates I would legislate for that.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there have been moves on interest rates. On 1 May, AIB Group announced a number of reductions to its mortgage interest rates for owner occupier and buy-to-let mortgages. </p>  <p>  A series of reductions over a fixed time frame would be acceptable to me and in that context I welcome AIB's announcement as a good first step. Competition between the banks will be crucial in ensuring that the price that the customers have to pay moves in the right direction. </p></reply>

However, I note that a number of commercial credit institutions have introduced products to assist borrowers who are in negative equity and who wish to move to a new home.</p>  <p>  To further assist people in negative equity to move to a new home, it should be noted that the recently introduced Central Bank macro prudential regulations on residential mortgage lending have excluded a primary home borrower from the loan to value part of the regulations so as to avoid unduly limiting the mobility options for borrowers in negative equity.  </p>  <p>  While the financial and property downturn unfortunately resulted in many borrowers experiencing negative equity, the overall economic improvement since then has had a positive impact on the situation of many mortgage holders and the Government intends to continue to work to maintain a sustainable economic recovery.</p></reply>

The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers. Following revaluation there generally will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy. </p>  <p>  Section 9(10) of the Valuation Act 2001 provides that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative. Section 19(1) of the said Act empowers the Commissioner, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the rating authority concerned, to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted. </p>  <p>  The revaluation programme which began with South Dublin County Council, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas has been rolled out more recently to the Dublin City Council area, Waterford City and County Council area and Limerick City and County Council area. The statutory consultation process, required before a valuation order can be made, is now being conducted in relation to a further three rating authorities, Galway City Council, Kilkenny County Council and Carlow County Council.</p>  <p>  The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).  Accordingly, the next revaluation of the South Dublin County Council area will be undertaken between now and 2017 and the 2nd   revaluation of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown will take place between now and 2020.</p></reply>

Our approach towards expenditure management enabled Ireland to regain its fiscal credibility, restore its international reputation, and reach a position as Europe's fastest growing economy.</p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of strategic infrastructure requirements, my Department has been undertaking a review of the public capital programme.  The purpose of the review was to assess all areas of public capital investment and to refresh the existing investment strategy and multi-annual envelopes.  This is to help ensure that they are in line with emerging Government priorities and that our resources are focussed on the areas that can best underpin continued economic growth. The report of the capital review is currently being finalised and will set out the capital envelope to 2020.  I intend to publish the report in June.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, managing the delivery of public services within agreed budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department to ensure that Vote-level allocations are adhered to while at the same time ensuring that they continue to provide essential services and respond appropriately to increasing demands.  My Department continually monitors voted expenditure throughout the year to compare drawdown of funds from the Exchequer against published expenditure profiles. There is regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within agreed allocations. I report a monthly analysis of spending trends to Government, and we publish information each month as part of the Exchequer Statement.  The position at the end of April was a gross total expenditure underspend of &euro;115 million (-0.7%) against profile.   Expenditure will continued to be monitored closely  for the remainder of the year so as to ensure that  our fiscal targets are met. </p>  <p>  Finally, Departments regularly review and analyse matters and areas for which they have responsiblity.  In this regard, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) is an integrated cross-Government service which enhances the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy making.  IGESS staff operate in designated economic evaluation units and are engaged with almost all Government Departments.</p></reply>

The central measures under the Agreement were, for the most part, fully implemented from 1 July 2013.  </p>  <p>  In addition to delivering on monetary targets, a number of reforms and changes to work practices, such as additional working hours, have been implemented since 1 July, 2013. It is the responsibility of managers in all public service bodies, working with staff and their representatives, to ensure that the maximum benefits from the additional hours, both in terms of cost reduction and changes to work practices to build overall productivity, continue to be realised.</p>  <p>  Through the Haddington Road Agreement and its predecessor the Croke Park Agreement, together with the FEMPI legislation, public servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery of the State including by way of direct reductions in pay and pensions.  From 2009 to 2014 the cost to the Exchequer of public service pay was reduced by &euro;3.7 billion, or more than 21%.  As well as reducing the pay and pensions bill, the HRA is a key enabler for the Government's Public Service Reform programme, as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan 2014 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Croke Park Agreement, I am satisfied that the Agreement delivered on its objectives, facilitating the delivery of &euro;1.8 billion in cost reductions over its lifetime, a view shared by the Implementation Body in their final report.</p></reply>

Public Procurement savings are necessary to enable public service organisations deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets that they must now operate.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the Procurement Reform Programme savings of &euro;100m in 2013 and 2014 have been reported by the OGP and its partners, equivalent to saving 2,000 front-line jobs.  The &euro;100m excludes &euro;16.5m in Utilities savings from OGP sourcing activity in 2014 as this would be regarded as a cost avoidance procurement benefit rather than a cash saving as the savings arise from beating inflation.</p>  <p>  However, I would point out that reforms in this area are being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of SMEs.  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  Circular 10/14 issued in 2014 by my Department is aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.  This guidance set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises as well as highlighting practices that are to be avoided because they can hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.</p>  <p>  I would add that the OGP supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  For example, last year the Office of Government Procurement supported two "Meet the Buyer" events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by over 1,100 suppliers. The Office of Government Procurement also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SME's.  This year InterTrade Ireland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SME's to jointly bid for state contracts.  </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work with suppliers and business representatives to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

This process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal .  This portal is the Irish Government's public platform for advertising public sector procurement tenders. The eTenders system automatically sends out email notifications of tender notices published on the system above &euro;25,000 to registered suppliers who have expressed an interest in the particular type of goods, services or works specified in the tender notice by the contracting authority. This is driven using the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) codes of the European Commission. </p><p>The Supplier Register in eTenders holds company information as entered by each supplier.  Historically many suppliers have registered their company multiple times and often provided incorrect business profiles.  Accurate registration and the correct settings for eNotifications gives suppliers maximum exposure to tendering opportunities in the Irish Public Sector.  <font color="#2F2F2F">While significant progress was made during 2014 in cleaning up supplier data, work is still on-going.</font></p><p>The Office of Government Procurement is working with industry representative bodies to promote the engagement of Irish business in public procurement (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Last year, for example, the OGP supported two 'Meet the Buyer' events - one in Belfast and the other in Dublin attended by over 1,100 businesses, 20 Go To Tender workshops and 4 Taking Care of Business events with a combined attendance in excess of 2,000 businesses.  In addition, the OGP proactively launched a campaign to get more businesses to register on the eTenders system and existing Suppliers to correct their profiles which resulted in 12,300 new supplier registrations in 2014.</p></reply>

In addition to the reduced cost of the Public Service overall, reform is also delivering savings across a range of specific areas such as shared services, procurement reform and property management.</p>  <p>  A new Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 was published in January 2014.  While maintaining an emphasis on efficiency and reducing costs, this Plan puts a particular focus on improved service delivery and achieving better outcomes.  The actions set out in the Reform Plan address areas such as: greater use of shared services and innovative approaches to service delivery; increased use of technology and improved engagement with service users; more efficient and effective public procurement and property management; increased accountability and transparency in public decision making; enhanced leadership and performance management; and a continued focus on building the required capacity to deliver reform and service improvements across the Public Service.   A comprehensive Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 was published in March of this year and can be seen on my Department's website.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Taoiseach and I published a Civil Service Renewal Plan in October last year.  The implementation of this ambitious three year plan will lead to major changes right across the Civil Service.   </p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that we have made significant progress on Public Service Reform to date and that this will remain a key element of our recovery strategy.</p></reply>

All staff affected by the announcement may contact the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) either individually or collectively, to discuss their employment rights, including matters related to redundancy.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90.  </p><p>If my Department becomes aware of a potential company closure in advance, or if the business at risk is a client of one of my Department&rsquo;s enterprise development agencies, the Department or agency will do everything within their power to assist that business.

The LEOs can provide advice and direction, covering all government supports and requirements, to anyone who wishes to start or expand a business. The LEOs can also provide funding for projects that meet certain criteria, in certain circumstances, and other non-financial supports including training and mentoring. Further information is available from the Local Enterprise Office South Dublin, County Hall, Tallaght, Dublin 24, Phone: 01-414 9000, Email: , website: .</p><p>I would urge anyone who was made redundant or who is in danger of losing their job, and who may be thinking of setting up their own business, to make contact with their local LEO to explore available options in relation to entrepreneurship. Further information can be found on the LEO website at .</p><p>In terms of new initiatives for job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through continuing to work with established companies in its portfolio including those based in Tallaght and other South Dublin areas. The agency is also supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up high potential start-up companies with the potential for new job creation. </p><p>In addition to marketing Tallaght for new investment, IDA Ireland also works with its existing client companies in Tallaght and South Dublin with a view to encouraging them to grow and embed their business in Dublin. In this regard, Dublin is recognised as one of Europe&rsquo;s leading business locations and is well positioned as a &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; city which competes successfully on the global stage.  </p><p>Earlier this year, the Government announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional initiative which will seek to maximise the strengths and assets of each region to support enterprise growth and job creation.  In launching the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional initiative, I also announced that new funding of up to &euro;250 million will be made available over the next five years to support job creation through enterprise growth in the regions.  This includes &euro;150 million for an IDA property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment, and &euro;100 million to Enterprise Ireland to support indigenous enterprises to start up, grow and export.

The development and coordination of the Action Plan for Jobs was, and is, led by my Office and Department. Forf&aacute;s were centrally involved in this process before it was integrated with the Department in August 2014.   </p>  <p>  At the political level, an Economic Recovery and Jobs Cabinet Committee oversees the development of the Action Plan on an annual basis and reviews progress on a monthly basis. The Committee, which I convene, is chaired by the Taoiseach. It includes the Ministers for Finance; Public Expenditure and Reform; Education and Skills; Social Protection; Communication, Energy and Natural Resources; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Agriculture, Food and the Marine; as well as junior ministers for International Banking, Business and Employment, and Skills, Research and Innovation. The Committee also co-ordinates other relevant sector-based policies including Pathways to Work, thus facilitating synergies and co-ordination across the strategies aimed at supporting sustainable job creation. </p>  <p>  At the administrative level, a Monitoring Committee is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the actions identified in the APJ. The Monitoring Committee is jointly chaired by the Secretary Generals my Department and of the Department of the Taoiseach and membership includes the Office of the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. One of my Advisors is a member of this Monitoring committee.</p>  <p>  At the sector level, a number of task forces, groups and committees contribute to the steering and implementation of the APJ.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, senior analysts from Forf&aacute;s/DJEI have been located in the Department of the Taoiseach to support monitoring and co-ordination of the APJ. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the OECD in its review of the Action Plan for Jobs process in 2014, that the APJ&rsquo;s most striking innovation in the Irish public policy context is a coordination mechanism that ensures high-level political buy-in and oversight, whole-of-government engagement, and the establishment of quarterly targets underpinned by a robust monitoring system.</p></reply>

Despite some specific company losses in the Sligo area in the recent past, the overall unemployment trend in the region has improved significantly over the last few years.  Unemployment in the Border Region, although still too high, stood at 10% the end of Q4 2014 (down from a high of 17.7% in Q3 2012), with the creation of an additional 11,200 jobs in the region since the publication of the first Action Plan for Jobs in Q1 2012.   I consider that it is not practicable or effective to establish jobs task forces or specific jobs plans around the country as a general mechanism to address unemployment.  I believe that to embark on such a course would involve diverting the various State Agencies from their on-going efforts to create jobs. A considerable administrative commitment is involved in servicing any additional committees and groups which may be set up and, given the constrained staff resources facing all public sector bodies at present, I am strongly of the opinion that establishing such additional groups, except in very exceptional circumstances, would not be in the best interests of using the State&rsquo;s resources effectively.</p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to Regional Development, and under the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs which I launched earlier this year, it is intended to develop and publish a suite of Regional Enterprise Strategies, based on consultation with key stakeholders at regional level and on the analysis of the strengths of each region. I attended the Border Regional Stakeholders forum in Sligo on 26th  of March. The process will commence with the publication of strategies for the Midlands and South East regions. Preparation of similar strategies for the other regions is also under way and will be finalized over the next few months.  All will include specific actions for all the enterprise development organisations and other public bodies active in each region, to promote enterprise growth and job creation. Of course specific issues and factors relevant to particular regions will be fully embraced in the new Strategies. </p>  <p>  The regional Action Plans will be supported by investment of up to &euro;250 million over the next 5 years, including &euro;150 million for a property investment programme by IDA Ireland, and up to &euro;100 million for three separate competitive calls which will be administered through Enterprise Ireland. These competitive calls will support collaborative initiatives to boost enterprise growth and job creation in the regions. Detail of the competitive calls will be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  As part of its property programme, IDA has committed to investing in new property solutions. Sligo, Tralee and Castlebar are to the forefront of the 2015 investment programme with other locations scheduled to follow in subsequent years.</p></reply>

This will see a reduction in the number of agencies or bodies under the remit of my Department fall by 41. This includes the dissolution of 35 City and County Enterprise Boards, the merging of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, the integration of Forf&aacute;s into the Department, the integration of Shannon Development into a new Shannon Group and the consolidation of the five workplace relations bodies into two.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which was established on 31<sup>st</sup>October, has a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law and will build on the work of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to protect and strengthen competition, empower consumers to make informed decisions and protect them from harmful business practices.</p><p>The transfer of enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and tourism functions to Bord F&aacute;ilte took place during the last quarter of 2013.  The legislation to merge Shannon Development and Shannon Airport into a new commercial state company, State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, was enacted on 27<sup>th</sup>July 2014.  Responsibility for the newly formed Shannon Group PLC rests with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p><p>Last year, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards were dissolved under the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act, 2014, and on the same day 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) were established. Under the legislation, the functions, assets and liabilities were transferred to Enterprise Ireland (EI), and these functions are now being delivered on behalf of EI by the LEOs.  The reformed structure provides a service which amalgamates national enterprise policy and local business supports in order to strengthen the local business culture and environment. The LEO structure combines the expert knowledge of the former County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), the Business Development expertise of the Local Authorities, overseen by the dedicated National Centre of Excellence in Enterprise Ireland which ensures that &lsquo;best-practice&rsquo; prevails across the LEO network.</p><p>Forf&aacute;s was integrated into my Department with effect from 1<sup>st</sup>August 2014 under the Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Act, 2014.  As part of this integration the functions of the Irish National Accreditation Board were transferred from Forf&aacute;s to the Health and Safety Authority on 31<sup>st</sup>July 2014, in advance of the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s.</p><p>A Reform Programme also underway will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission.  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.</p><p>There will be savings made as a result of shared services and abolition of Boards but, more importantly, the new streamlined structures will provide a quicker, simpler and improved service for the taxpayer.</p><p>Details of the position to end April 2015 on the above and other measures are set out in the table below as follows:-<table><tr><th>Measure</th><th>Position to end April 2015</th><th>Associated annual savings </th><th>Reduction in Staff</th></tr><tr><td>Merge the National Consumer Agency (NCA) and the Competition Authority into one single entity</td><td>The Competition and consumer Protection Act 2014 (No. 29 of 2014) amongst other things, provided for the establishment of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the dissolution of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  The establishment day for the CCPC was 31st October 2014</td><td>Prior to the amalgamation there already has been expenditure in the legacy organisations associated with the establishment of the new body.  Savings of approximately &euro;170,000 per annum will be achieved as there will be no fees for a Board or Chairperson to be paid (or associated costs such as travel and subsistence for Board members) while some minor savings might be realised in other areas</td><td>In 2008 when the merger was first announced, the combined ECF figure for both organisations was 139 whereas in 2014, the directly comparable figure was 86.  (In 2010 an extra 20 posts were added to the ECF of the NCA to cover the new functions assigned to the NCA under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 in the financial services area.)</td></tr><tr><td>Dissolve the 35 County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and transfer their functions to Enterprise Ireland (EI).</td><td>The 35 City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were legally dissolved on 15th April 2014 and their functions, assets and liabilities transferred to Enterprise Ireland.</td><td>Over time it is expected that there will be some savings from the removal of costs associated with the individual company status of each CEB.  In addition, the use of shared services and the reduced rental costs associated with the relocation of offices will result in savings.</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><td>Dissolve Forf&aacute;s and provide for the transfer of the agency&rsquo;s assets, liabilities and staff to my Department and other bodies, as appropriate.</td><td>The Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Act 2014 which provided for the transfer of the functions and staff of Forf&aacute;s to my Department and a number of State agencies was enacted in July 2014.  <br /><br />Forf&aacute;s was integrated into my Department with effect from 1st August.  </td><td>The rationale for integrating Forf&aacute;s into my Department was to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. The integration will facilitate improvements in the use of existing resources against the backdrop of the moratorium on Public Sector recruitment. <br /><br />The dissolution of Forf&aacute;s gives rise to a potential saving on Board Fees of approx. &euro;100,000 per annum.</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><td>Transfer relevant enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and Bord F&aacute;ilte and merge Shannon Development with Shannon Airport</td><td>Shannon Development&rsquo;s functions and the associated staff in relation to indigenous enterprises and foreign direct investment have been transferred to Enterprise Ireland and IDA respectively.  Shannon Development&rsquo;s functions in relation to tourism including the Regional Tourism Offices have been transferred to F&aacute;ilte Ireland. These changes have been accompanied by the redeployment of staff to other public bodies and the implementation of a voluntary redundancy scheme.  The restructuring of Shannon Development has been completed.  The Government recently approved legislation &quot;State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014&quot; to establish the Shannon Group as part of a drive to establish an International Aviation Services Centre in the mid-west with the aim of delivering new routes and new jobs for the region.</td><td>This is a restructuring and merger of Shannon Development and Shannon Airport.  As Shannon Development was self-financing there was no direct cost saving to my Department. There was, however, an elimination of duplication of roles between Shannon Development, Enterprise Agencies and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the region.  This restructuring resulted in significant savings for the Exchequer.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services to deliver a simplified two-tier structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court</td><td>The process of establishing a new two-tier workplace relations structure is continuing.  <br /><br />Significant progress has been achieved to date in relation to the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the Workplace Relations Reform Programme, including the establishment of a Shared Workplace Relations Customer Relations, a Shared Post-Registration Unit and an Early Resolution Service, the completion of the design of a Customer Relationship Management Solution, the transfer of the Equality Tribunal to the Department, the launch of an e-complaint facility and Workplace Relations website, the recruitment of WRC Adjudicators and two Labour Court Deputy Chairpersons, the design and delivery of training to Adjudicators and the design and implementation of enhanced technologies and business processes.<br /><br />The Workplace Relations Bill 2014, which will give legislative effect to the reforms, was published on 30th July, 2014.  The Bill has completed all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas (completed its passage through the Dail on 21st January, 2015 and the Seanad on 1st April, 2015). It will be necessary for the Bill to return to the Dail to obtain approval of the amendments introduced in the Seanad (which is scheduled for 12/13/14 May, 2015). The Minister aims to have the Bill enacted in Q2 2015 with a view to establishing the new structures shortly thereafter.</td><td>The annual cost of the Workplace Relations Services amounted to just over &euro;20 million in 2010.  It is expected that significant savings, in terms of both reductions in staff numbers and increased efficiency and productivity, will be generated by this Reform Programme.<br /><br />Annual savings of <br /><br />&euro;2 million per annum.</td><td>Staff reduction of 30 will be generated under the initial phase.</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Science and Engineering (DSE) Programme</td><td>In March 2012, responsibility for the DSE Programme transferred from Forf&aacute;s to Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).  The programme is now named SFI Discover</td><td>The transfer of DSE to SFI resulted from synergies between the DSE programme and SFI&rsquo;s outreach programmes, and this transfer of responsibility was not by itself expected to generate cost savings. The integration of these programmes has achieved economies of scale, minimised duplication of effort, and contributed to operational efficiencies.</td><td>Not applicable</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) to the Government</td><td>The Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser was included in the bodies due for critical review under the Public Sector Reform initiative.

Those protections include the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2007, which provide for a process of information and consultation between the employer and the employee representatives in circumstances where a collective redundancy is proposed, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2005, which give employees entitlements to specified notice periods or payment in lieu of notice and the Redundancy Payments Acts which are administered by the Minister for Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Under the Protection of Employment Acts, a collective redundancy situation exists where, during a period of 30 consecutive days, an employer proposes to make a certain proportion of the workforce redundant.  These proportions are (1) at least 5 employees redundant in an establishment normally employing between 20 and 49 employees, or (2) at least 10 employees redundant in an establishment employing between 50 and 100 employees, or (3) at least 10% of the employees where between 100 and 299 are employed or (4) at least 30 employees where more than 300 are employed.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the provisions of the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 may apply. It provides that all the rights and obligations of an employer arising from a contract of employment, other than pension rights, existing on the date of a transfer (as defined in the Regulations), are transferred to the new employer on the transfer of the business or part thereof.  A complaint that an employer has contravened these Regulations in relation to an employee may be presented to a Rights Commissioner.</p>  <p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  NERA&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Customer Service Section provides information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations and how to obtain redress where appropriate.  </p>  <p>  Workplace Relations Customer Services staff are available to meet the Cadbury workforce to provide information and answer any questions they may have with regard to their present situation. </p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery is available, if required, to assist the parties concerned. I know that in similar situations in the past, the parties have facilitated access to commercially sensitive information such as company accounts. It is a matter for the parties in each dispute to decide however.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.</p>  <p>  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process. The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavor, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences. </p>  <p>  I understand that the management and employee representatives are in discussions on the above issues and a variety of other issues.</p>  <p>  I continue to monitor this situation very closely.  Enterprise Ireland has had meetings with the company&rsquo;s management on a weekly basis since the announcement of the proposed job losses.  I have directed Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to continue their drive to find alternative projects for the area affected.</p></reply>

The LEOs can provide advice and direction, covering all government supports and requirements, to anyone who wishes to start or expand a business. The LEOs can also provide funding for projects that meet certain criteria, in certain circumstances, and other non-financial supports.  For example, with regard to the financial supports available, it should be noted that the LEOs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which over time can develop into strong export entities. However, there are other non-financial supports available, such as mentoring and training, and the LEO staff can advise as to which supports would be most appropriate. Further information is available from the Local Enterprise Office Dublin City, Civic Offices, Block 4, Floor 1, Dublin 8, Phone: 01-222 5611, Email: , website: </p><p>In addition, any business can use the LEOs to access finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises (employing less than 10 people) with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local LEO.

The industry contributes an estimated &euro;500 million per annum in economic output to local economies around the tracks which have a wide geographic spread. The greyhound industry also contributes significantly to tourism in Ireland, having successfully identified and developed a niche market among continental European visitors.</p>  <p>  The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was established under Section 12(1) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 for the purpose of giving support to the horse and greyhound racing industries. In accordance with the Act, 80% and 20% of the monies paid into the Fund each year are distributed between Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon, respectively.</p>  <p>  Funding to the horse and greyhound racing industries decreased by 29% between 2008 and 2014.</p>  <p>  In 2015 the allocation to Bord na gCon was increased by &euro;2.8m to &euro;13.6m, which is a 25% increase from the 2014 level, to restore funding to an important sector that makes a significant contribution to the economy in terms of employment, exports and tourism. This increase in funding is linked to the extension of the betting tax in 2015 to online betting and betting exchanges which is scheduled to take effect later this year.</p>  <p>  The 2013 audited annual report and accounts of Bord na gCon are at present with my Department for consideration and will shortly be presented to Government for noting. The annual report and accounts will then be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas prior to their publication by Bord na gCon.</p></reply>

The main providers are: University College Dublin provides a HETAC level 8 degree in Horticulture as part of its Bachelor of Agriculture Science degree programme. The course covers a wide range of subjects including landscaping, nursery stock, sports turf management along with science and business.</p>  <p>  There are 16 final year students on the course.  Teagasc Colleges at Kildalton and the National Botanic Gardens provide a range of horticultural courses including FETAC level 5 with most students then progressing to level 6. In conjunction with Waterford institute of Technology, students can progress to the BSc in Horticulture at HETAC level 7. Approximately 50 students per year graduate across the colleges at level 6 and 7.  Cork Institute of Technology, in conjunction with the Teagasc Agricultural College in Clonakilty, provide HETAC level 7 and 8 degrees in Horticulture Blanchardstown Institutes of Technology also provide their own horticultural degree courses at level 7 and 8 with upwards of 20 graduates per year.  Some other Institutes of Technology are also looking at the opportunities of providing courses in horticulture.  Many of the graduates of these courses work in nurseries, landscaping and as managers of horticultural establishments or go on to establish their own businesses.</p>  <p>  Overall, there are a significant number of courses and training opportunities for those who are interested in a career in horticulture and I am confident that the Colleges are constantly monitoring the situation to ensure that there is a sufficient number of graduates emerging from these institutions to meet the requirements of industry.</p></reply>

While the sector contributes over &euro;700m to the economy and provides the equivalent of 12,500 full time jobs, its full potential has not been reached.</p><p>Against that background, last year I launched an initiative by Horse Sport Ireland, Teagasc, the Royal Dublin Society to devise a ten-year strategy for the sport horse industry and in February 2015, I launched their report entitled &ldquo;<i>Reaching New Heights: Report of Irish Sport Horse Industry Strategy Committee&quot;</i>.  The report contains a wide range of recommendations for the development of the sport horse industry over the next ten years, including improving quality through more focussed breeding, developing the education and training structures for the transfer of knowledge to breeders, improving the marketing and sales capacity across the industry, increasing participation in the sector, progressing the health and welfare of horses and deepening the institutional capacity to deliver on the goals of the strategy.</p><p>The Strategy Report provides a roadmap to inject greater confidence and professionalism into the industry and will be used as a vehicle to promote and inform policy with particular emphasis on job creation and sustainable enterprise development and the facilitation of export led growth.  In addition to the annual grant and the equine infrastructure grants that my Department provides to Horse Sport Ireland, I allocated an additional sum of &euro;600,000 to HSI for 2015 to facilitate their plans to enhance marketing, to increase prize-money across a range of competitions and to stimulate some innovative events.</p><p>One such innovative event organised by HSI in conjunction with Bord na gCon is &lsquo;Jumping in the City&rsquo; whereby in the month of June showjumping competitions will take place at three greyhound stadia, Cork, Limerick and Shelbourne Park, with a view to raising the profile of showjumping.  Also I recently launched the Knowledge Transfer measure under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. This is one of a suite of measures included under the Rural Development Programme and will involve the formation and administration of knowledge transfer groups in the equine sector in 2015 which will be a vital part of an enhanced structure for education and training of equine breeders.</p></reply>

Priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;. A new entrant is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years. The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Following my Department&rsquo;s consultation with the EU Commission, I announced in March 2015 that the group commonly known as &ldquo;Old Young Farmers&rdquo;, who established their holding between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, and who, due to the timeframe of setting up their holding did not benefit from either the Installation Aid, which closed for applications in October 2008, or the Young Farmer category of the National Reserve, can be considered as a &lsquo;group suffering from specific disadvantage&rsquo;. The result is that this group is eligible to apply to the National Reserve under Phase 2 which opened for applications on 1st April 2015. Successful applicants under the National Reserve will be eligible for an allocation of entitlements at the National Average value on land for which they hold no entitlements (on the basis of 1 entitlement for 1 hectare of eligible land declared). In respect of existing entitlements with a value below the National Average, they will receive a top-up to the National Average value. The allocation of entitlements and top-up to the value of existing entitlements is subject to a maximum of 90.</p>  <p>  The person named has been in correspondence with my Department regarding his application under the National Reserve. He had initially applied for the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; priority category of the National Reserve but subsequently contacted my Department regarding the &lsquo;Old Young Farmer&rsquo; category for young farmers who established their holdings in 2008 and 2009. My Department issued the Terms and Conditions for the &lsquo;Old Young Farmer&rsquo; scheme to the person named and also notified him that his request to have his application amended has been accepted.</p></reply>

Developing a unique selling point for Irish dairy produce is a critically important element of the national strategy for the development of the sector, particularly in the context of the need to maximise market returns for significantly increased production in competitive markets world-wide. It remains clearly evident, from engagement with potential customers for Irish dairy products that the sustainability message inherent to the sector in Ireland has a strong resonance.  Irish dairy co-operatives and PLCs export their produce to some 130 countries and of course, some 60% of Irish dairy output is marketed through a joint co-operative venture &ldquo;The Irish Dairy Board&rdquo; which has recently rebranded itself as &ldquo;Ornua&rdquo;. These companies have already proven their capability on international markets and I am confident they will continue to do so in the quota free environment. </p>  <p>  As a support to this effort, in 2012 I announced a proposal for a new national sustainability programme for the dairy sector. This programme, the Bord Bia Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme (SDAS) was launched in December 2013 and is a key element in Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for marketing and promotion of dairy products on international markets, particularly in the context of expanded milk output following the abolition of milk quotas in April of this year.   </p>  <p>  The Bord Bia Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme was developed in cooperation with milk producers, processors and regulatory authorities. It has been designed to assist in securing new and existing markets for Irish dairy produce as farmers look to increase milk production in a post quota era.   </p>  <p>  This SDAS programme is independently verified and establishes a point of differentiation that sets our dairy products apart in world markets. The carbon footprint element is pivotal in demonstrating the strong climate change credentials of Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector, and indeed it has already been established that Ireland&rsquo;s GHG emissions from the dairy sector are the joint lowest in the EU. To date there have been 6,405 audits completed with 5,667 farms certified. Another 684 farms are currently pending audit.   </p>  <p>  The scheme facilitates Bord Bia in conjunction with the dairy industry in positioning the Irish dairy sector globally as a source of verifiably sustainable dairy production. The SDAS programme, including audits, are funded directly by industry and managed by Bord Bia. To promote the SDAS to customers of Irish dairy, the industry provides a promotional fund to Bord Bia and this will be focussed across 3 primary target regions, namely Europe, China and the Middle East at a business to business level.   </p>  <p>  Bord Bia also has a central budget from Government which is used, inter alia, for the promotional activities in relation to dairy through attendance at trade fairs, market research in developing markets and consumer research. This funding is set to increase by 14% in 2015, which includes funding for Bord Bia to assist in the marketing of Irish food and drink including dairy at this year&rsquo;s Expo in Milan. Taken together, I am satisfied that the foregoing measures as outlined reflect the strong ongoing commitment to making resources available to ensure developing and exciting markets in the dairy sector can be appropriately pursued.   </p></reply>

That is why this Government has invested heavily in the development of a rigorous program of food safety and traceability measures allowing us to trace from farm to fork. Not only do we implement EU legislative measures, but we go further with national food quality and controls systems to ensure that we are world leaders in food safety assurance.  Moreover, we are the only country in the world to have a national sustainability program in place for our food and drink industry, which includes additional food safety checks; and measurable and audited sustainability targets for each farm and food business. </p>  <p>  Of course there are sectors where imports comprise a greater proportion than we would like. One of these is the fruit and vegetables sector but the reality is that a high proportion of these imports occur at times when it would not be economically feasible to produce in Ireland, mainly during the winter months. To address this issue, my Department continues to provide grant aid for the sector to encourage innovation and to assist growers to compete with imports and to meet the high demands of the retail sector. In March of this year, approvals issued to 158 applicants involving grant aid of &euro;5.7million, and when fully drawn down, this will support grower investments to the value of over &euro;14million. </p>  <p>  The Department also continues to support two Producer Organisations in the sector both Teagasc and Bord Bia work closely with the industry to provide technical advice and marketing expertise. </p></reply>

The poultry sector supports around 5,000 jobs, most of these in rural areas. The value of primary output for the total poultry sector, including eggs, has remained relatively static over the last five years. Output stood at &euro;177 million in 2011, &euro;189 million in 2012, &euro;183 million in 2013 and approximately &euro;186 million in 2014. Given that the forecast for consumer demand remains somewhat stable , estimates for 2015 stand at &euro;18 6 million.  Export values however have increased steadily over the same period from &euro;210m in 2011 to c. &euro;310m in 2014, growing by 20% alone in the last year as the value of trade was driven by increased shipments of processed products. Strong fundamentals supported demand in almost all regions of the world in 2014 and this is expected to continue in 2015, although some easing in global poultry prices is expected. Irish production is forecast to remain stable during 2015 as EU and international production is estimated to increase marginally. However, the impact of cereal price changes will influence output decisions by producers as the year progresses.</p><p>The new Rural Development programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 (RDP) will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector going forward, and will be of particular relevance to a number of key areas within agriculture, including the poultry sector. The main areas for support in the RDP for the poultry sector will include:<blockquote>- significant support for on-farm capital investment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme II (TAMS II) scheme;<br /><br />- knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions.</blockquote></p></reply>

In response to a request for a meeting with representatives of the Forgotten Farmers Group, officials from my Department met with a delegation from the group on 1 April 2015.  At this meeting the main request of the group was to increase the value of entitlements for farmers who are under 40 years to the National Average value of entitlements in 2015. It was estimated that this group would comprise of no more than 300 farmers.  Following the meeting my Department carried out analysis of the group of farmers involved.  It has been established that 3,900 farmers fulfil this criteria.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the National Average for these 3,900 farmers stands at &euro;12.288m.   </p>  <p>  EU Regulations governing the National Reserve stipulate that young farmers and new entrants must be given priority status in allocating funding from the National Reserve.  Under these Regulations a &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; is defined as a farmer less than 40 years of age who commenced their farming activity during the previous five years.  Given the number of applications under phase 1 of the National Reserve, it is not envisaged that there will be available resources to cater for this large additional group of farmers who did not commence their farming activity during the previous five years.</p>  <p>  Many of the farmers in this group will benefit from an increase in the value of their entitlements under the convergence process between 2015 and 2019.  Farmers who hold entitlements that have an Initial Unit Value that is below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average will see the value of their entitlements increase gradually over the five years of the scheme.  By 2019, all entitlements for all farmers in Ireland will be at least 60% of the National Average value.   </p>  <p>  With regard to access under Pillar 2 to the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for young farmers who established their holdings prior to 2008, I intend to prioritise their applications under TAMS, with grant-aid payable at 40%.</p></reply>

The introduction of these provisions will bring some welcome flexibility to the system.  However, the creation of new reference areas for a significant number of land parcels across the entire Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) database is a complex matter and has to be approached very carefully.  Significant and systematic testing is required to ensure that the re-calculations are accurate.  It is not possible at this stage to establish the level of additional land that will be eligible for payment under the new Regime.  Such information will be established when the new system is fully operational and applications received under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme are assessed.

It forms part of the country&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme and will have a budget of approximately &euro;300m over a period of 6 years.  The cost related to genotyping will be approximately &euro;7 million or about 15% of the funds provided.  This is the same percentage of payments as under the 2014 scheme.  The BDGP will accelerate improvement in the crucial area of environmental sustainability in the national herd through the application of genomic technology and will bring about long-term strategic improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  It will also position Ireland as a global forerunner in the application of genomics technology and confirm our reputation as one of the most important and renowned export focussed beef producing nations in the world.  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that.  Payment to scheme participants is on basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.  All of the costs to the farmer, including in terms of time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission.  The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing, and this will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  Costs associated with training and the advisor&rsquo;s costs associated with completing the carbon navigator are paid separately from the &euro;142.50 and &euro;120 per hectare payment the farmer will receive.  The cost of completing a carbon navigator in conjunction with an approved advisor will be covered separately and will not be deducted from the farmer&rsquo;s payment.  The farmer will also be provided with an additional &euro;166 to compensate for the time and travel costs associated with attending the training course.  As the deputy notes, the ICBF will have a key role to play in facilitating the scheme in the same way as my Department has collaborated with that organisation for the Beef Genomics Scheme and the Beef Data Programme in recent years.  Estimates provided by the ICBF for the costs of undertaking the individual actions are in line with the previous schemes although the overall payment will increase in line with the increased volume of work being undertaken.  These costs will continue to be agreed bilaterally, in advance, between my Department and the ICBF. </p>  <p>  Finally, as I said at the launch of the scheme, it marks another major milestone in positioning Ireland as a world leader in climate friendly agriculture and is a unique opportunity for some 35,000 suckler farmers spread right throughout Ireland.  I am confident it will significantly improve efficiency at farm level in Ireland.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities will certainly be taken.  I should also say that while the criminal law in this area is being kept under ongoing review, there is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  In relation to the question of Garda resources and the particular policing strategies in the areas referred to, the Deputy will appreciate that these are matters for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Kildare Division as of 31 March was 299 Garda&iacute;, of which 73 were in the Leixlip District which includes Carbury Garda Station, where there were 5 Garda&iacute; assigned.  Two additional Garda&iacute; have recently been assigned to Carbury.  I am assured that the allocation of overall Garda resources is kept under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure these resources are put to the best possible use.</p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that, thanks to the resumption of Garda recruitment, the Commissioner now has the capacity to deploy new Garda&iacute; for the first time since 2009 and five new probationer Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Kildare Garda Division.  Similarly, investments are being made in vehicles and IT, and in the recruitment of specialist professional staff.  Policing and community safety in Kildare will undoubtedly benefit from this injection of resources, as it will in all other Garda Divisions.</p></reply>

I share the recently expressed views of the Garda representative bodies about the unfortunate necessity to have to divert Garda resources to police water meter protests when those resources could be used for other policing purposes.</p>  <p>  The statutory functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na include the preservation of peace and public order, protecting life and property and vindicating the human rights of individuals.  In the context of these functions it has been necessary for the Garda authorities to deploy Garda&iacute; routinely at water meter installations and protests.  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in such instances is to ensure, insofar as it is possible, that members of the public may go about their lawful business.  Indeed, the presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also essential to ensure the safety of protesters in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na always endeavours as best it can to facilitate peaceful protests and demonstrations.  However, it is always unfortunate when a small number of individuals resort to means other than peaceful ones to express their views, to intimidate others or to engage in protest.  We have, unfortunately, seen examples of this in respect of some of the protest actions against water charges and the installation of water meters.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the behaviour of a small number of individuals whose motivation is other than peaceful is taking up Garda resources which could be better deployed for the benefit of society elsewhere.  In that context An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the support of the Government in carrying out their duties in what can be a difficult policing situation.</p></reply>

The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence. </p><p>These new offences are comparable to those introduced in section 15 of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 which the Deputy correctly states will come into force on 1 June.</p><p>The Bill is priority legislation and is currently being drafted.  It is my intention to publish the Bill in the current parliamentary session.</p><p>As an additional means of combatting the exploitation which is associated with prostitution, these offences will target the demand side of prostitution.  However, there are already legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purposes of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and/or a fine.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>I would also like to advise the Deputy of existing laws in the area of prostitution.  Under section 6 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.  It is also an offence under the 1993 Act to organise prostitution, to knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute or to keep or manage a brothel.  In addition, public order legislation prohibits the advertising of brothels and prostitution.  I am satisfied that these provisions are adequate to address any impacts to this State arising from upcoming reforms in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

The annual cost of the contract will depend on the number of prisoners who are monitored throughout the course of the year. It is expected that the average monthly costs of the contract will be in the region of &euro;9,500 (excluding VAT).</p>  <p>  The total cost of the provision of electronic tagging in 2014 was &euro;73,961.  For 2015, the total cost as at 30th  April 2015 is &euro;34,119.</p>  <p>  As I have previously explained, electronic monitoring is mainly used by the Irish Prison Service to monitor prisoners who have been granted temporary release from prison to attend as hospital in-patients.  It thus allows for a reduction in staffing costs for hospital escorts. In considering any prisoner for temporary release, under the specified conditions relating to the management of the electronic monitoring process, public safety remains the primary operational consideration.  In this context there are 4 offenders on conditional release with an electronic tag. </p>  <p>  The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons.  Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements, often referred to as the "sex offenders register".</p>  <p>  At present there is no provision in the Act for the electronic tagging of sex offenders.  Provisions have been included in the General Scheme of the new Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, which will amend the Sex Offenders Act, to allow for the electronic tagging of sex offenders in certain circumstances.

Otherwise, the issue of what is or is not consent has been developed through case law.  The courts have confirmed that consent requires voluntary agreement by a person at the age of consent and with the necessary mental capacity.  "Knowledge or understanding of the facts material to the act being consented to is necessary for the consent to be voluntary or constitute acquiescence."  (DPP v C [2001], Court of Criminal Appeal).  I have not been advised that the existing position regarding the definition of consent has given rise to any difficulty in the prosecution of sexual offences.</p>  <p>  The scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill as approved by Government does not contain any new definition of consent.  It contains wide-ranging and complex proposals relating to the protection of children as well as enhancing the way in which the State manages sex offenders.  It is a very important piece of legislation and one which I have prioritised for publication during the current parliamentary session.</p>  <p>   I would be concerned that to attempt a comprehensive statutory definition of consent would be a complex undertaking.  There is a real danger that it might cause unintended problems without any obvious benefit as, at best, a statutory definition of consent is likely to mirror the  existing common law position.</p>  <p>  If a real problem with the existing position is identified, I am open to considering the position.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 October 2011.</p><p><i>Legal Aid Custody Issues Scheme</i></p><p>This Scheme provides payment for legal representation in the High Court and the Supreme Court for certain types of cases not covered by civil legal aid or the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme namely (i) Habeas Corpus Applications, (ii) Supreme Court Bail Motions, (iii) Judicial Reviews, (iv) Extradition Applications and European Arrest Warrants and (v) High Court Bail Motions.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on </p><p>1 June 2012. </p><p><i>Criminal Assets Bureau Legal Aid Scheme</i></p><p>The Scheme is applicable to persons who are respondents and/or defendants in any court proceedings brought by, or in the name of, the Criminal Assets Bureau including court proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Revenue Acts or the Social Welfare Acts and applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  Responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred to the Legal Aid Board on 1 January 2014.</p><p><sup><font color="#000080"> </font></sup>It is proposed that the administration of the main Criminal Legal Aid Scheme will be transferred to the Legal Aid Board on foot of new legislation which is currently being drafted.  This move will be in keeping with the international model for the delivery of legal aid and advice services and will achieve a more dedicated focus to the management and delivery of Criminal Legal Aid.  It would be premature at present to commit to a date for the transfer of the scheme. </p><p><i>Family Mediation Service</i></p><p><sup></sup>In addition, the Board took on responsibility for the Family Mediation Service in November 2011 which had been under the auspices of the Family Support Agency up to that point.  A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common.  There are very positive signs which include the initiative set up in 2011 operating from the District Court in Dolphin House involving a co-location of the Courts with a family mediation service and a law centre.  This has proved very successful and was put on a permanent footing in 2014. Similar initiatives are now operating from Cork, Naas, Limerick, Clonmel and Nenagh.  Integration of the Family Mediation Service into the Legal Aid Board has also meant an increase in the referrals from Law Centres to mediation in appropriate cases.</p><p><b>Merger of the Property Registration Authority, Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland</b></p><p>The merger of the Property Registration Authority (PRA), Valuation Office (VO) and Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) has been mandated by the Government under the Agency Rationalisation Programme.

The CEO Designate of the merged body which is to be named Tailte &Eacute;ireann, was appointed from 1 July 2013.  It is anticipated that Ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will be transferred to the Minister for Justice and Equality in due course.  I can also advise that the General Scheme of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill (which provides for the merger of the PRA, VO and OSI) was published on 22 January 2015 and has been forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for formal drafting.  Subject to progress on drafting, I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill later this year. </p><p><b>Dissolution of the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests</b></p><p>The Charities Regulatory Authority, which is an independent regulatory body for the charities sector, was established on 16 October 2014, under the Charities Act 2009.

As the work of the former Commissioners, which related to supporting the trustees of charities in carrying out their functions in accordance with the Charities Acts 1961 and 1973 will continue under the new Authority, there have been no savings or staffing reductions arising from this change.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><b>Dissolution of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning</b></p><p>The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) was responsible for overseeing the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.

In doing so, officials in INIS maintain regular close contact with relevant Government Departments and agencies.  It is, however, important to stress, at the outset, that the vast majority of tourists visiting the State-over 96%-are from countries whose citizens do not require a visa to travel to the State e.g. the United Kingdom, other EU states, the United States, etc.</p>  <p>  In July, 2011, the Government launched the first ever Irish Short-Stay Visa Waiver Programme.  Under this Programme, tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa are able to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  The Programme covers eighteen countries including major emerging tourism and business markets such as China and India.  The Programme has proven extremely successful leading to an increase in visits from the countries covered by it of 68% from 2010 (the last full year before its introduction) and 2013.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of this programme, negotiations took place with the United Kingdom authorities on the development of a reciprocal programme i.e. of also allowing visitors with an Irish visa to travel to the UK on the basis of that visa.  These negotiations led to the establishment of the British Irish Visa Scheme which I launched, with the UK Home Secretary, in October last year.  This Scheme was implemented in China later that month and in India in February of this year.  The Scheme, which will supersede the Waiver Programme, allows visitors to travel to and around the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, including the north and south of the island of Ireland, on a single visa.  A formal joint review of the Scheme with the UK is due to be carried out shortly and both Governments have committed to the worldwide rollout of the Scheme to be substantially completed by the end of this year.  I am confident that this Scheme will build on and expand the growth in visitor numbers resulting from the original Waiver Programme.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, a liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other regular visitors with a good visa history, has been implemented in the Irish Visa Offices in Beijing, Moscow, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi over the last few years.  This regime allows for the issue of multi-entry visas for up to five years' duration for applicants with a good previous visa history.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing visa regime continues to support and facilitate tourism growth from countries whose citizens are visa-required for travel to the State.</p></reply>

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  </p><p>The volume and complexity of cases has led to the review taking longer than originally anticipated, but it is important that counsel take the time necessary to consider each case fully and carefully.  It is therefore considered inappropriate to place a time constraint upon the working of the Panel.  Nevertheless counsel are making every effort to conclude their work as soon as is reasonably practicable.  Although counsel have not finished their work, my Department has received a number of recommendations and I therefore intend to start the process shortly of notifying the persons concerned of the outcome of the review in their cases.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>Counsel have been asked to make a recommendation to me on what action, if any, might be appropriate in each case.  The Panel is independent and therefore no restriction can be placed on the nature of recommendations which they might make.  In this regard, and without in any way pre-judging the outcome in any individual case, I think it is important to be realistic and to acknowledge that it may well be that no further action is recommended in a significant number of cases.  This may particularly be so where the persons involved have already exhausted the options open to them, such as where their cases have been investigated by GSOC or heard by a court. </p><p>Nevertheless, it is open to the members of the Panel to make recommendations as they see fit in relation to each case.  Each recommendation will be very carefully considered, but as a matter of general principle let me say quite clearly that, in coming to a decision in each case, I will be very strongly guided by the independent advice of counsel.  Quite clearly having engaged counsel for this review, it would be entirely appropriate to be guided by their advice.  In the event that recommendations arise in regard to a Commission of Investigation, consideration will be given to whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.</p></reply>

This review concluded that in Mr. Murphy's opinion there were deficiencies in the conviction of Mr Gleeson which render it unsafe, and I gave further details of these matters in my original statement.  Having considered Mr. Murphy's opinion, the Attorney General advised the Government that the deficiencies in the conviction warranted the Government recommending to the President that he exercise his right of pardon.  The Government accepted this advice.</p>  <p>  The Government deeply regrets that a man was convicted and executed in circumstances now found to be unsafe.  All that can be done now by way of remedy is to clear his name of the conviction, and that process has been put in train.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  Over the period 2012 to 2014, my Department, as with all Government departments was required to deliver substantial savings on all major funding programmes under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012 - 2014.  In line with these savings requirements the reduction in finding provision for the youth services over the period amounted to approximately 18.75%.  This takes into account an allocation of &euro;1m provided in Budget 2014 to offset the impact of the savings requirements on the youth services.  My Department in determining the annual allocations to youth programmes, while having regard to the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure savings requirements, sought to ensure that, as far as possible, the focus was maintained on the frontline youth services, particularly those for vulnerable young people.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.  An allocation of &euro;1.92m has been made for the provision of youth services in Co Waterford in 2015.  In 2014, an allocation of  &euro;1.92m was made and in 2013 and 2012 allocations of &euro;1.99m and &euro;2.28m were provided to support local youth services.  </p>  <p>  In recent years capital funding has been allocated by my Department for capital projects in the youth services.  This included provision to support youth cafes, refurbishments, equipment and other capital works projects.</p>  <p>  Capital funding was allocated to youth services in County Waterford as follows:</p>  <p>  - 2012 - Capital funding of &euro;32,700 to support 2 Youth Cafes;</p>  <p>  - 2013 - Capital funding of &euro;100,000 to support 2 Youth Cafes;</p>  <p>  - 2014 - Capital funding amounting to &euro;20,142.87 was made available to fund small capital projects in the youth services in the Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board area.  Three local youth projects received grants under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Information on the numbers of workers and volunteers involved in the provision of youth services throughout the country including in Co Waterford is not readily available in my Department.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the challenges that the youth services have faced in recent years in continuing to provide high quality services that meet young peoples needs.  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups.  In January and February, officials of my Department met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations to discuss recent and upcoming developments and to hear their plans for the services in 2015.  My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  My Department is developing a new National Youth Strategy.  It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10-24 years and will have a particular focus on those young people who are most marginalised or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore who are most in need of support.  The National Youth Strategy is being developed in close consultation with the statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people.  The Strategy recognises the importance of quality youth work programmes and services that are evidence based, preventative, and designed to secure optimal outcomes for young people.  My Department is working to finalise the new National Youth Strategy by the Summer.</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency and the Ombudsman for Children's Office. </p>  <p>  Up to 31st December, 2013, my Department also funded the Family Support Agency (FSA) and the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The Child and Family Agency, established on 1st January 2014 under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, has statutory responsibility for services previously provided by the NEWB and FSA. In addition, the Agency has responsibility for children and family services previously delivered by the HSE together with domestic and sexual violence services, certain psychological welfare services, and preschool inspection services.  The coming together under one Agency of such a range of services provides a platform for the delivery of more efficient and effective services to children and families.  The remit of the Agency will contribute to the achievement of its overall vision, which is seeking to bring about greater integration of services with a focus on early intervention and community engagement.</p>  <p>  As the new Agency subsumed all of the staff and functions of the NEWB and the FSA there have been no savings of any significance accruing.  The achievement of establishing the Agency means that, for the first time, there is a dedicated body responsible for child care and protection in Ireland.  However, it is envisaged that when the staff of the former FSA and NEWB move into Tusla's new building, there will be a full year saving of &euro;112k based on rent.</p>  <p>  In July 2011, the Government decided that the Family Mediation Service should transfer from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board.  This is in line with the Government's commitment to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes  in order to speed up the legal process, reduce cost and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015.  This was an important priority for the voluntary youth organisations that have a key role in the provision of quality youth work services for young people. </p><p>Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the voluntary youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning.  My Department works closely with the youth sector interests in various fora in developing key initiatives. </p><p>Three of the targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme, were the subject of a recently completed <i>Value for Money and Policy Review.</i>The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities. In 2012, expenditure on the schemes amounted to &euro;39.7m.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people, and should be considered for on-going public funding. </p><p>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. It recommends that the three schemes be replaced with a single, targeted, evidence-based and outcomes focussed scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities.  It sets out guidance as to how services may be developed to better meet the needs of young people in the target cohort and how demographic information and CSO data about local areas should be part of the programme design. </p><p>My Department has undertaken a detailed consultation process with the youth sector and providers of youth services, including volunteers, about the review's findings and recommendations.  The consultation included regional meetings across the country.  All local services were invited to participate.  My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the voluntary youth sector, in the development and implementation of the new programme over the next two years.  Support for volunteers engaged in the provision of youth services is a priority for my Department in this context.  Supports in place include training and awareness programmes in child protection matters through the National Youth Council of Ireland, and support programmes for both staff and volunteer led youth services in implementing the quality standards initiatives in local youth services.  I intend that the reforms recommended in the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy, which is nearing completion.  The strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years.  It will have a particular focus on the needs of young people who are at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes.  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be finalised in early Summer</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-12a.715.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015051200066#WRP01700"><p>Funding requirements and how resources should be prioritised and allocated across each area of Government spending are generally considered as part of the annual estimates cycle and budgetary process.  My overall objective over the period 2016 to 2021 will be to realise funding allocations that reflect expenditure policy priorities and demographic provision and that sufficient resources are directed towards those areas of greatest impact on children and young people. </p><p>Ireland is experiencing substantial demographic growth. For example, a report titled &ldquo;Primary and Post-Primary Education 2015-2030&rdquo; prepared by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (DPER) indicates that pupil numbers at primary and post primary level have increased by over 60,000 in the last 5 years.  The same report considers a likely increase of some 15,000 pupils in primary/post primary schools in 2015 compared to the previous year, gradually rising to a peak of approximately 979,000 pupils in school in 2024, compared to 889,000 in 2014.  While this report was prepared in the context of the Education sector it is reasonable to extrapolate a similar increase in demographic demand in relation to services provided across the vote of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in particular in the range of services provided by the Child and Family Agency, the youth sector and pre-school services. </p><p>There is an increasing demographic demand manifesting itself in child and family services.  The period since 2006 has seen an upward trend in child welfare and abuse referrals.  Since 2012 there has been a change and standardisation in the counting methodology used by the HSE/Tusla for abuse and welfare referrals making it difficult to make direct comparisons with current figures.  However it is clear that the trend in referrals has been increasing, with totals reaching over 40,000 child welfare and abuse referrals per annum.  Following screening, the numbers of cases deemed as needing a social work service has not increased to the same degree.</p><p>While the overall number of children in care has increased, the number of children being admitted to state care has been decreasing steadily over the last number of years.  This fall is contrary to other key related figures: the rising child population, rising levels of referrals to Tusla, and the rising number of children in care.  The increase in the number of children in care overall is a feature of children not exiting care.  This is due to an increase in the number of children staying longer in care and, although the numbers entering care has decreased, it is still greater than the numbers leaving.  Introduction of standard business practices, the application of national thresholds and measures to address children&rsquo;s needs through other interventions (eg: Pathways/Meitheal) are expected to provide better information for the management of services.</p><p>Therefore, it is vitally important that unavoidable costs due to demographic pressures are fully addressed in the annual estimates process and that the impact of demographic change in this regard for the costs of programmes and schemes administered by my Department are properly captured on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The Deputy might also note that <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020 </i>was published and launched by Government in 2014.  The framework comprehends the continuum from infancy through early and middle childhood to adolescence and early adulthood.  It provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people.  The Framework brings together key policies instanced in the Programme for Government including those relating to prevention and early intervention initiatives, early childhood education, breaking the cycle of disadvantage, through area based approaches to address child poverty, aftercare provision and addressing issues around anti-social behaviour.  It also provides a means for cross departmental collaboration to promote the well-being of children and young people and a fresh impetus to a whole-of-government approach to current and emerging issues, including childhood obesity, healthy lifestyles, the impact of media and new technologies, the sexualisation of children and promoting pro-social behaviour.  It accommodates a number of constituent strategies which focus in greater detail on the areas of Participation, Early Years, and Youth.</p></reply>

It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS Action Plan.  It involves 124 locally managed projects and provides targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million was provided for the School Completion Programme.  The Agency has indicated  a similar allocation for the programme in 2015. The Agency has advised that Chairpersons of Local Management Committees have been requested to prepare their school retention plans for the 2015/2016 school year based on the expenditure allocated last year and to return them to the Agency by June 5th.  Following receipt of these plans projects will be notified of their allocations for the 2015/2016 school year. </p>  <p>  The ESRI is currently reviewing the School Completion Programme, which will help in future decisions on its structure, governance and operation.

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008.  The HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary, to deliver front-line services. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in Budget 2015 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.  The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy, outlining planned pay expenditure and staff numbers.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction will be issued. As this process is still ongoing, the existing moratorium and Employment Control Framework arrangements continue to apply.</p></reply>

Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services.  People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultant services.</p>  <p>  Separate to the public health system, my Department oversees the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2014, and monitors developments on an ongoing basis to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately.  The policy objective of introducing Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) to the health insurance market is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age, as community-rated markets depend on a continuing influx of younger people to help spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market and helping to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the purchase of private health insurance is optional.  The regulatory framework governing health insurance, such as late entry loadings under LCR, applies to all persons choosing to purchase health insurance and is not related to a persons eligibility, or previous eligibility, for public health services.  People who do not take out health insurance continue to have the same entitlement to services in the public hospital system.</p></reply>

However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, under section 4(2), designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister James Reilly T.D, wrote to the The Health and Social Care Professionals Council last year seeking advice on the question of specifically designating counsellors and psychotherapists under the 2005 Act.</p>  <p>  A number of issues require clarification and there are varying views among the professional bodies representing counsellors and psychotherapists in Ireland.  The main questions to be resolved include whether counselling and psychotherapy should be treated as one or two professions for the purposes of regulation, the title or titles of the profession(s) to be protected, and the minimum qualifications that would be required of applicants for registration.

Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services.  People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultant services.</p>  <p>  Separate to the public health system, my Department oversees the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2014, and monitors developments on an ongoing basis to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately.  The policy objective of introducing Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) to the health insurance market is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age, as community-rated markets depend on a continuing influx of younger people to help spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market and helping to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the purchase of private health insurance is optional.  The regulatory framework governing health insurance, such as late entry loadings under LCR, applies to all persons choosing to purchase health insurance and is not related to a persons eligibility, or previous eligibility, for public health services.</p>  <p>  On the issue of unemployment specifically, there are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it.  A credited period (in total not exceeding 3 years) is available for individuals who previously had health insurance but relinquished cover since 1 January 2008 due to unemployment. In such cases, the level of loading will then be reduced by the relevant credited period(s).</p></reply>

This review, which is almost complete, has been carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche Consultants on specific issues which required specialised expertise.  The Review, as well as considering how the Scheme has operated to date, identifies some of the broader issues that will need to be considered and tested more fully into the future, including the future financing of the full range of supports for older people, how community and residential supports and services should be balanced, and whether new care approaches can contribute positively to older peoples' needs.</p><p>The Review will be completed and made publicly available in the near future.</p></reply>

It is reported that the proportion of overweight and obesity will increase in Irish men from 74 and 26 percent to 89 and 48 percent. For women the increase in obesity will be from 23 to 57 percent. The WHO states that by 2030 Europe will face an obesity crisis of &ldquo;enormous proportions&rdquo;. The WHO caution that the data need to be interpreted with extreme caution as it is a forecasting exercise. </p><p>In Ireland the level of obesity has doubled over the past 20 years. Currently two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and one in four children is overweight or obese. One in five adults is physically inactive and only 25 percent of children meet the guidelines on physical activity.</p><p>The Special Action Group on Obesity was established by the Minister for Health in 2011 and is working on a range of measures including:<blockquote>- The development of revised Healthy Eating Guidelines<br /><br />- Media campaigns to promote awareness on healthy eating<br /><br />- Treatment Guidelines for overweight and obesity<br /><br />- Calorie Posting in restaurants<br /><br />- Developing a code of practice for marketing in the non-broadcast media</blockquote>In addition, Ireland proposed the development of an EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity and is now leading part of this work.</p><p>The Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills have also been working together on embedding and integrating health and wellbeing into the education system. Specifically, the two Departments have been working to ensure a more co-ordinated approach and infrastructure, involving the HSE, to support schools and teachers to address health and wellbeing issues arising in schools.</p><p><b>New Obesity Policy and Action Plan</b></p><p>In recognition of the obesity challenge, the Department has commenced work on an Obesity policy and Action Plan under the Healthy Ireland Framework.  The plan will run from 2015 to 2025. Significant progress has already been made in implementing Healthy Ireland. It is only through taking this &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;whole of society&rdquo; approach to improving health and wellbeing, that we can collectively address the environmental conditions leading to many health problems.</p><p>A national consultation day was held in Farmleigh on April 27 involving approximately 150 key stakeholders with representation from Government Departments, County Councils, Industry, university departments and the education sector. Further consultation days are planned for children and healthcare professionals.</p><p>It is intended to develop an action plan not only for the health system but also to propose options for other sectors which play a key role in preventing overweight and obesity.  This action plan will be finalised this year and brought to government for approval.</p><p>In addition, due to concerns about low levels of physical activity in Ireland, the Department of Health and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a number of other key stakeholders, are currently developing a National Physical Activity Plan which is expected be launched later in the year.</p></reply>

Lifetime Community Rating applies only to the current private health insurance market. In a community-rated health insurance market, everyone pays the same premium for the same product regardless of age or risk status. Under Lifetime Community Rating (LCR), community rating is modified to reflect the age at which a person takes out private health insurance. Lifetime community rating applies only to the current voluntary private health insurance market. It was introduced on the 1st May 2015 as a means of encouraging more people to join the market at a younger age and provides for 'loading' based on the age of a person when they first purchase private health insurance. Any loading that applies when a person purchases private health insurance will continue to apply until such time as UHI is in place. Lifetime Community Rating will not<b></b>apply when we move to UHI. Instead, under UHI everyone will be obliged to purchase community rated universal health insurance, ie. everyone will be charged the same premium for the same policy regardless of age or risk profile. In addition, a system of financial support will ensure affordability by paying or subsidising UHI premiums for all those who qualify.</p><p>I hope that this provides the clarity the Deputy was looking for.</p></reply>

It is acknowledged that the waiting times for spinal surgery services at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin are unsatisfactory and must be addressed as a priority.  Accordingly, funding was allocated in the HSE Service Plan for 2015 for the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  This will maximise the use of available theatre sessions in the hospital.  The first of these additional staff is now in post, and recruitment for the remaining posts is in process.  In addition, capital funding has been agreed for a new theatre on site at Crumlin, which will expand theatre capacity further.  As a further measure, available capacity is being identified in other hospitals and some children are being transferred for their surgery, where it is considered clinically appropriate for them. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issues raised by you, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The Bill is part of a suite of measures agreed by the Government in 2013 on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy. The other measures (eg for the HSE, professional bodies etc) set out in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant departments and organisations. The HSE has responsibility for implementing a number of recommendations and some of these measures are reflected in the HSE Service Plan for 2015.  The remit of the Drugs Task Forces was extended to include the problem of alcohol misuse last year, in view of the key they play in co-ordinating the response to substance misuse at local level.</p></reply>

Since 1 May, &lsquo;late entry loadings&rsquo; apply for those aged 35 and over who did not purchase health insurance prior to that date. There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it. A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover where a full adult premium rate has been paid. In such cases, the level of loading will then be reduced by the relevant credited period(s). </p>  <p>These credited periods apply for periods of health insurance cover purchased with registered health insurers in this country. Periods of cover on health insurance plans held outside the State will not be taken into account when calculating loadings,   as such plans do not comply with health insurance legislation or the key principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and minimum benefit on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. In addition, providers of health insurance schemes based outside the State are not registered with the Health Insurance Authority, the statutory regulator of the health insurance market, and have not obtained a certificate of registration from the Authority under Section 14 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994. </p></reply>

In order to carry on the business of health insurance in Ireland, it is necessary for health insurers to be registered and to obtain a certificate of registration from the Authority under Section 14 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994. There are three types of health insurer in Ireland: </p><p>- Insurers such as Aviva Health, GloHealth, Laya healthcare and Vhi Healthcare that provide in-patient health insurance cover and that must accept, subject to certain limited terms and conditions, all persons who wish to purchase private health insurance cover. These insurers may also provide cash plans. </p><p>- Restricted Membership Insurers which provide insurance to people who are members of a particular group, normally a vocational group or employees of a particular organisation and their dependants.</p><p>- Insurers (such as Vhi, laya, GloHealth and the Hospital Saturday Fund) that only provide cash benefit plans in certain circumstances.</p><p>A certificate of registration is valid for 12 months. The Authority only issues a certificate once it has examined the scheme and it is satisfied that the proposed scheme of the health insurer complies with all relevant legislative provisions. The issuing of a certificate confirms that a health insurer may offer private health insurance in accordance with the terms of their rules and with the legislation. Any registered undertakings that has ceased to provide health insurance must be removed from the Register.  <b></b></p></reply>

Through this mechanism, which addresses the issues directly with the Colombian authorities and includes input from civil society groups, the EU and member states engage in a structured manner across the full range of human rights concerns, including as regards human rights defenders and the slow pace in the decrease of impunity.   The Human Rights Dialogue is an important forum in which the EU engages constructively with the Colombian authorities, makes suggestions on how difficulties can be addressed, and shares experience with its Colombian counterparts. During the last session of the Human Rights Dialogue, in October 2014, issues such as the land restitution process, the situation of human rights defenders and the challenges facing protection schemes were addressed. In addition, the EU and its member states support both national authorities and civil society organisations working with the protection of human rights defenders. I believe that this policy of engagement, dialogue and scrutiny, which is ongoing, regular and structured, is the best way to promote human rights in Colombia.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Bogot&aacute; on a non-residential basis, is in regular contact on human rights issues with the Colombian authorities, with civil society, and with the EU delegation there. </p>  <p>  With regards to the United Nations, the Universal Periodic Review is a unique mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council whereby the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN member states are peer-reviewed on a regular basis. Colombia&rsquo;s most recent review took place on 23 April last year. In the course of the review, Ireland made specific recommendations on Colombia&rsquo;s National Protection Programme for human rights defenders, referring particularly to the difficulties faced by trade unionists and journalists. In addition, Ireland urged Colombia to address high levels of impunity and the lack of access to justice for victims of gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  The UN High Commission for Human Rights is actively involved in Colombia and Ireland supports their operations there. I agree with the view expressed in the High Commissioner&rsquo;s report that an end to the longstanding armed conflict - now under negotiation between the government and the guerrillas - has the potential to transform Colombia in terms of its level of respect for and enjoyment of human rights.  Ireland will continue to encourage and support a successful outcome to these negotiations.</p></reply>

These are: the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee; the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group; the NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights; and the Standing Committee on Holocaust Education, Research and Remembrance.  All appointments are unpaid except for appointments to the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group. For that group, members receive an allowance of &euro;2,000 per annum and the Chairperson receives an allowance of &euro;3,000 per annum, although the current Chairperson has waived this. </p><p>None of these bodies have been merged or abolished since 2011. However, in September 2013, the Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC), which was responsible for providing advice on development education, was officially disbanded.  Its abolition followed the publication of &lsquo;<i>One World, One Future&rsquo; -</i>Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development - which provided for a member of the DEAC to be appointed to the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group.  This Committee was serviced from the Department&rsquo;s overall budget, and it had no whole time equivalent staff. Accordingly, there were no significant savings arising from its abolition. </p><p>My Department intends also to establish an Oversight Group with an Independent Chair in order to monitor implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security 2015-2018.  The Plan outlines actions Ireland will take in its development, political and peacekeeping engagement in order to (i) ameliorate distinct adverse effect of conflict on women and girls and (ii) increase the participation of women in decision-making in conflict and post-conflict situations. The Oversight Group will comprise representatives of the relevant statutory authorities as well as representatives of civil society organisations, academics and independent experts. The Commission is a bi-national Education Commission between the Irish and United States Governments.  Members of the board do not receive remuneration and no vacancies currently exist nor are any anticipated to arise before 1 January 2016.</p><p>The boards, bodies or committees on which vacancies currently exist or on which vacancies are anticipated to arise up to and including 1 January 2016 are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>Board, Body or Committee</th><th>Expected Date of  vacancy </th><th>Number of Vacancies</th><th>Chair/Member</th><th>Appointment Process</th></tr><tr><td>Oversight Group &ndash; National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security</td><td>Spring 2015</td><td>TBC</td><td>TBC</td><td>Nomination of Minister.

A reduced term of validity for children&rsquo;s passports is necessary as children&rsquo;s appearances change significantly within a short period of years, which can lead to uncertainty regarding the identity of the passport holder. However this is not generally the case for adults of any age. Furthermore introducing an arrangement whereby adults of any age would be eligible to apply for a passport for a period of less than 10 years would increase the total demand for passports on an ongoing basis and would require the recruitment of additional staff in the Passport Offices to cope with increased demand.For these reasons, there are no plans to introduce a passport of less than 10 year validity for adult applicants, regardless of age.</p></reply>

The cost of exempting those aged 65 and over from passport fees was estimated in 2011 to be &euro;2.4 million per annum in terms of lost revenue and, as the shortfall would have to be met by the taxpayer, I have no plans to introduce any such measures at this time.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that the annualised fee for a standard Irish passport compares favourably with many other jurisdictions.

I addressed the ninth NPT Review Conference in New York on 27 April in order to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s continuing strong commitment to nuclear disarmament, while also meeting with a number of delegations.  At present, my Department&rsquo;s officials are participating actively in the Review Conference and are pressing, with our like-minded partners in the New Agenda Coalition and in other groups, for an ambitious and forward-looking outcome. </p>  <p>  The question of establishing a legal prohibition on the investment of public money in companies manufacturing nuclear weapons is being considered by my Department.  The dual-use nature of nuclear technology means that it is important to distinguish between companies which are engaged in products which advance the peaceful uses of nuclear technology permitted under the Treaty and companies which facilitate production of nuclear weapons. My Department&rsquo;s officials are consulting with other Governments, such as Norway and New Zealand, which have enacted legislation on this matter, and will consider on the basis of these consultations whether or how similar legislation could work in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, let me assure the Deputy that Ireland applies a stringent export controls regime under the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which does not permit the export of Irish technology to any enterprise known or suspected to be connected with a programme for the development or delivery of any weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including nuclear weapons.</p></reply>

The focus in schools is on using ICT as a tool in learning guided by the ICT curriculum framework developed by the NCCA. This is supported by digital content on the scoilnet website, by professional development programmes for teachers and by investment in ICT infrastructure. All post primary schools are now connected to a 100 Mbps broadband service, providing for improved integration of ICT in learning.</p>  <p>  The new junior cycle allows for the introduction of school-developed short courses of 100 hours duration as an option.  This provides further opportunities for schools to progress the provision of courses in IT.  The NCCA has published a short course in Coding.  In addition, ICT is an area of essential learning which all students are required to experience, and Managing Information and Thinking is embedded in subjects as a core skill.</p>  <p>  In the new junior cycle all students are required to achieve 24 statements of essential learning.  These include using ICT effectively and ethically, using appropriate technologies to meet a design challenge, applying practical skills, and developing models and products using a variety of materials and technologies.</p>  <p>  There is also a Transition Year option in relation to Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games and, under the ICT Action Plan, this is being expanded nationally.</p>  <p>  Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) are also significant components in the syllabuses of Technology and Design and Communication Graphics. </p>  <p>  The NCCA is giving consideration to including Computer Science as one of the possible areas of application for consideration under 'Option 3' on the Leaving Cert Applied Maths syllabus, as set out in their Background Paper.  A Development Group has been tasked with the work of preparing the new specification over the current year. When a draft specification is ready, there will be a further round of consultation - in late 2015 or early 2016.</p></reply>

The body is funded from the contributions of the religious congregations offered in response to the request for additional contributions, following the publication of the Ryan Report. </p><p>Under the provisions of the Further Education and Training Act 2013, F&Aacute;S with a staffing of 1,108 was dissolved in October 2013 and the new Further Education and Training Authority, An tSeirbh&iacute;s Oideachais Lean&uacute;naigh agus Scileanna (SOLAS) was established with responsibility for funding, planning and co-ordinating training and further education programmes. SOLAS was established on 27 October 2013 and funded for the remainder of the year from the residual FAS budget. SOLAS has a current full time equivalent staffing of 211.</p><p>  Under the Public Service Reform plan a number of bodies were merged as follows.  The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged in March 2012 to form the Irish Research Council (IRC). The IRC has been established as a sub-board of the Higher Education Authority (HEA). Its function is to award research funding, primarily for postgraduate students and early-career postdoctoral researchers. The establishment of the IRC will result in an estimated saving of &euro;100,000 on an annual basis. </p><p>  Under the provisions of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) were amalgamated to form a new agency, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). QQI's functions are set out in Section 9 of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012. These include the development of awards and standards, review of education and training providers, development of quality assurance, validation of programmes, maintenance of the National Framework of Qualifications and facilitation of qualification recognition.The estimated saving following the merger is &euro;1 million on annual basis. </p><p>  Under the provisions of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have replaced 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs). The functions of ETBs are set out in Section 10 of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013. Following re-configuration of the VECs, the number of Chief Executive Officer posts have been reduced from 33 to 16. This change has resulted in full year savings of the order of &euro;1.9m. Further savings are likely to be achieved through the realisation of economies of scale arising from the mergers and the wider Education and Training Sector Reform Programme.</p></reply>

The terms of reference covered all staff in the Institute comprehended by the unions' parity claim, including those staff who were the subject of a previous Labour Court recommendation (LCR20577). The terms of reference provided for an Oversight Committee comprised of management and union representatives to monitor progress and prevent delays. An appeals process was also agreed between the parties which could be invoked following the conclusion of the evaluation exercise.</p><p>  Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) were appointed to conduct the exercise following a tender process. The selection was made by a joint panel made up of representatives of the employer and both unions.  It was also agreed that, following completion of the internal job evaluation exercise, the parties would engage in discussions to seek agreement on the implementation of PwC's recommendations and the outcome of the appeals process. In the event that agreement could not be reached the matter would be referred to the Labour Court and the parties would be bound by the outcome.  The PwC job evaluation report was presented to the parties in December 2014.</p><p>  If implemented, the report, which covers 182 employees, would provide for an average annual salary increase of about &euro;9,000 for 115 of the staff concerned. The report found that the remaining 67 staff are on a salary higher than the relevant UCC salary by an average of about &euro;10,000 per annum. Implementation of the report would add in excess of &euro;1,000,000 to the University's annual pay costs.</p><p>  However, in January 2015 management in UCC was informed that union members in Tyndall had rejected the report. A conciliation conference was held in the LRC in February during which the unions sought to set aside the already agreed appeals procedure. Management advised that it was adhering to the agreed appeals process brokered by the LRC. No agreement was reached and at the unions' request the issue of the appeals process was referred to the Labour Court. The Court concluded that no recommendation it might make at this time would advance the resolution of the dispute.</p><p>  The unions notified UCC of their intention to engage in four days of strike action during May, and three of those days of action have happened with the fourth due to take place on May 13th.  </p></reply>

The number of teachers vetted under the non-statutory arrangements continues to steadily increase with about 54,000 of the 90,000 teachers on the Teaching Council register now vetted. The remaining 36,000 who have not yet been vetted are typically permanent teachers who have been in the same school since prior to the introduction of non-statutory vetting in 2006.</p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, will, when commenced, put in place statutory requirements for vetting of persons involved in working with children and vulnerable adults, including those working in schools. I have also recently brought forward the Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2015 which is currently before the Oireachtas and which will underpin the central role of the Teaching Council in the operation of the statutory vetting arrangements for registered teachers. It is intended that this Bill will, when enacted and commenced, operate in tandem with the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. </p><p>  In relation to the operation of the forthcoming statutory vetting requirements for schools, a major focus of my Department is to facilitate, as far as possible, a smooth transition to the new statutory arrangements.In that regard, my Department recently published &quot;Circular 0026/2015 - Advance preparations for the commencement of statutory requirements for Garda vetting under the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (the Vetting Act)&quot; which outlines the preparations being put in place in advance of the forthcoming statutory vetting requirements. </p><p>  It is also intended that all registered teachers will be vetted under the statutory vetting arrangements as soon as possible after the legislation is commenced. I consider itpreferable and more effective from a child protection perspective that the cohort of 36,000  teachers who have not been vetted to date, are vetted under the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements for two reasons. Firstly the forthcoming statutory arrangements will include a check for both criminal offences and also any relevant &quot;soft information&quot; which is an important new element of the vetting procedures. Secondly when the Teaching Council Amendment Bill is enacted, there will a clear statutory basis for the Teaching Council to require such teachers to undergo vetting and for it to deal with any adverse vetting disclosure that might be received.</p><p>In the first year after the introduction of the statutory vetting arrangements the two key priorities for the Teaching Council will be to facilitate a smooth and timely flow of vetted teachers to the school system and to ensure that the vetting of the remaining circa 36,000 registered teachers who have not been vetted to date is completed as quickly as possible.  </p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. I recognise that teacher allocations set the parameters in relation to the number of subjects on offer in schools. However, the deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities. Sharing arrangements between post-primary schools can help to ensure that the range of subjects available to pupils is maximized, however my Department does not hold any information in relation to the number of schools currently engaging in such sharing arrangements.</p><p>  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions. Short term support is needed (normally for one year but not exceeding 2/3 school years) to enable the school authority to respond to the identified difficulty in meeting essential curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation.</p><p>  In order to further encourage inter school co-operation, specific account is taken where a request involves two or more neighbouring schools engaging in demonstrable co-operation arrangements, with an overall more efficient use of resources, in order to address on a collective basis the curricular needs of the schools concerned.</p><p>Any staffing concessions will be operated in a way to encourage inter school co-operation in the provision of efficient and effective educational services to the locality served and to encourage and facilitate good school management and planning in schools.  The detail of the curricular concession process is set out with the criteria for the allocation of posts and is also available on the website.</p><p>  The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are also set out in the published staffing arrangements. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Funding is provided by my Department on this basis. </p><p>  The current position is that where parents of children who are eligible for home tuition have sought alternative arrangements to be put in place for the tuition, my Department has responded and facilitated by putting arrangements in place with 6 private pre-school providers which provide group tuition to children in a class type setting.  Payment in these cases is made directly to the service provider and is calculated on a group rate basis.  The arrangements were put in place to facilitate the parents of the children in question.

However, earlier indicative figures of the cost of providing for demographics were set out in an analytical paper compiled by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of Budget 2013. The link to this paper is at the following address, . The paper calculated the impact of demographics in terms of teacher numbers in schools and of the cost of capitation grant payments. It estimated additional costs in this regard of some &euro;207 million arising between 2016 and 2021. In addition to these costs, there would also be impacts on other areas such as special needs expenditure, school transport and student grants. Demographic pressures will also create pressures on school accommodation and consequent pressure for capital investment. Much, however, will depend in this regard on the location and distribution of the additional pupil numbers.</p></reply>

The Tribunal recommended that the income of political parties be disclosed and that political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be reported.</p><p><b></b>The 2012 Act brought into force restrictions on corporate donations and considerable reductions in the maximum amount that a political party or an individual can accept as a political donation. <b></b></p><p>The donation limit for a political party was reduced from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500, while for an individual politician or candidate it fell from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000. A limit of &euro;200 was placed on donations in cash. The threshold for the receipt of anonymous donations was reduced to &euro;100.<b></b>The donation threshold amount that gives rise to the requirement to open a political donations account was reduced to &euro;100.

In line with SIPO guidelines, which came into effect on 1 January 2015, the first set of accounts required to be audited will be in respect of 2015 and must be submitted to SIPO by mid 2016. This requirement goes beyond the Moriarty Tribunal recommendation by providing that both the income and expenditure of political parties will be reported and open to public scrutiny.

My Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management provides support through setting general policy, the provision of training support and guidance on operational and other related matters, and capital funding which, over the last decade, has exceeded &euro;155 million.</p><p>Under Section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001 each City and County Chief Executive  is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements to carry out the functions within his or her local authority.</p><p>While the information sought in the question is not available in the precise format requested, the national figure of senior fire officers employed by local authorities is 201 in Q1, 2015.  The number of fire services with different numbers of senior fire officers is shown in the Table 1 below.</p><p>TABLE 1</p><p>NUMBERS OF SENIOR FIRE OFFICERS<table><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Total Employed</th></tr><tr><td>No. of Senior Officers in a fire service </td><td>3 </td><td>4 </td><td>5 </td><td>6 </td><td>7 </td><td>8 </td><td>9 </td><td>10+ </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No of fire services with this number </td><td>2 </td><td>8 </td><td>5 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>4 </td><td>4 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total Number of Officers </td><td>6 </td><td>32 </td><td>25 </td><td>12 </td><td>7 </td><td>8 </td><td>36 </td><td>75 </td><td>201 </td></tr></table></p><p>Overall, the number of Senior Fire Officers in local authorities has decreased from 270 in 2008 to 201 in 2014, a reduction of approximately 25% which is in line with the general reduction in local authority numbers.  In contrast, fire-fighter numbers in Ireland have been maintained at a constant level since 2009as shown in TABLE 2 below, despite the moratorium on public service recruitment. </p><p>TABLE 2</p><p>FIRE-FIGHTER NUMBERS<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Fire Fighters &ndash; Whole Time Equivalent </th><th>Retained Fire Fighters Headcount </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>31 DEC-09 </td><td>1222 </td><td>2049 </td><td>3271 </td></tr><tr><td>31 DEC-10 </td><td>1203 </td><td>2030 </td><td>3233 </td></tr><tr><td>31 DEC-11 </td><td>1189 </td><td>2077 </td><td>3266 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>31 DEC-12 </td><td>1212 </td><td>2041 </td><td>3253 </td></tr><tr><td>31 DEC-13 </td><td>1200 </td><td>2037 </td><td>3237 </td></tr><tr><td>31 DEC-14 </td><td>1199 </td><td>2039 </td><td>3238 </td></tr><tr><td>6 Year Average </td><td>1204 </td><td>2045 </td><td>3249 </td></tr></table></p><p>Fire services are provided by the local authorities and senior fire officer grades are analogous to local authority engineering grades. The senior officers provide fire service leadership and management functions which enable the fire services in Ireland to function on a 24 hour a day, 7 day a week basis.  In contrast to other jurisdictions where up to 20% of fire-fighter numbers are engaged in head-quarters/support functions, the senior fire officers in Ireland directly manage the operational fire services which have an annual budget of &euro;267m and are staffed by the 3,250 fire fighters.  They arrange, manage and deliver all training, procurement, maintenance, logistics and other support roles necessary for the functioning of the services.  The senior officer grade plays a critical background role in ensuring quality and consistent services to thepublic when these are needed.</p><p>In addition, the small corps of senior fire officers also provide a range of specialist statutory and community fire safety functions.  Fire officers also lead for local authorities in the area of major emergency management and co-ordinate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive.  In a number of cases they manage communication facilities and oversee the Civil Defence service.  Many fire officers also contribute to national/regional work to develop fire services in addition to their work with their own fire service.</p><p>It is a credit to our local authorities that they provide such quality and effective fire services.  Ireland is in the league of most fire safe countries, with a three year average fire fatality rate of 6.4 deaths/million of population in the three years 2012-2014.  Of course, each fire death is one too many and we cannot be complacent, but this statistic underscores the quality and professionalism of fire services which our fire authorities, led and managed by the small corps of senior officers, provide to communities.</p></reply>

Ultimately, these matters are considered by insurers on a case-by-case basis and neither the Government nor the Central Bank can direct insurers to provide home insurance cover to specific individuals.</p><p>My Department understands that Insurance Ireland, which is the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Their service can be contacted at Tel: (01) 676 1914 or by email at .</p><p>One of the key recommendations of the (July 2012) was the development of a protocol which would facilitate the testing and categorisation of dwellings to establish -</p><p>-  if there is reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material, and</p><p>-  whether it has caused pyritic heave.</p><p>In response to this recommendation, <i>I.S. 398-1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and Categorisation</i>was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in January 2013 and provides the means by which dwellings which may be affected by pyrite can be tested and categorised in order to assist in identifying appropriate options for remediation.  In broad terms, the standard sets out a two-step process to facilitate the testing and categorisation of dwellings.</p><p>Firstly, the standard requires that a Building Condition Assessment be carried out; this comprises a desktop study and a visual non-invasive internal and external inspection of a dwelling, by a competent person, to establish the presence or absence of visible damage that is consistent with pyritic heave and to quantify the extent and significance of such damage in that dwelling.  Damage ratings of 0, 1 or 2 can be assigned to a dwelling under this process.</p><p>Secondly, the results of the Building Condition Assessment will inform whether sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore of the dwelling will be required in order to confirm the presence or otherwise of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material.  Dwellings which have been tested and the hardcore is shown not to be susceptible to expansion are classified as Category A (i.e. green certificate).  These dwellings have a negligible risk of pyrite damage given testing has demonstrated that the hardcore is not susceptible to expansion; any damage that may be visible in such dwellings is likely to be attributable to other causes.</p><p>While there is no requirement on any homeowner to carry out testing on their property in order to confirm the presence or otherwise of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore, the standard does provide an objective, reliable and robust means by which dwellings can be tested and categorised.  Accordingly, where insurance cover may be at issue, it is open to homeowners with a damage rating of 1 to proceed with the testing of the hardcore material to establish whether it is susceptible, or not susceptible, to expansion.</p><p>In the case of dwellings remediated under the pyrite remediation scheme, all works will be completed by competent builders to the requirements of <i>I.S. 398-2:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &mdash; Part 2: Methodology for remediation works</i>, and will be overseen by construction professionals in accordance with the requirements of the Pyrite Resolution Board and the Housing Agency.  There will also be oversight by construction professionals from within the Housing Agency itself to ensure that the works will be fully compliant with the relevant requirements of the Building Regulations, that proper materials are used in the works and that remediated dwellings will be restored to the quality expected by the homeowners.  At the end of the works, each homeowner will be provided with certification to confirm that their home has been remediated to the requirements of the relevant standard.</p><p>In this regard, I have written to Insurance Ireland to confirm the range of measures that are now in place to mitigate future risk of pyritic damage to dwellings remediated under the scheme and have signalled that my Department is available to meet with representatives from the insurance sector to address any concerns they may have in these matters.</p></reply>

The capped annual charges are &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018. All households now know what their capped bills will be until the end of 2018, which is particularly important for larger households or those with high usage due to medical needs.  In addition, a water conservation grant of &euro;100 per year will be available to qualifying households.

The implementation of the range of actions under the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 Strategy will support increased housing supply. New house completions in 2014 amounted to 11,016 units nationally, up 33% on the 2013 figure.  In addition, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 published in November 2014 sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list. The total targeted provision under the Social Housing Strategy of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units through Pillar 1.  The private rental sector however, through Pillar 2 of the strategy, will accommodate up to 75,000 eligible low-income households primarily through the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.</p><p>The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) published two major reports on the private rental sector in 2014, entitled Future of the Private Rented Sector and Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector.  Both reports are available on the PRTB website<font color="#004080"> </font>at <i>and </i>.</p><p>The Social Housing Strategy 2020 includes a commitment to developing a national policy on the private rental sector aimed at increasing investment in and supporting the supply of, good quality, secure and affordable accommodation in the sector.  The PRTB reports referred to above, together with a forthcoming National Economic and Social Council (NESC) report on Ireland&rsquo;s rental sector, will be important inputs to the process of considering possible further policy and legislative initiatives.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas and will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, inter alia, for the establishment of a custodial deposit protection scheme.  This will provide protection for tenants, including those who find themselves in situations where a receiver has been appointed and the situation regarding the return of their deposit is uncertain.  The Bill has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with second stage in the Seanad.  It will return to the Seanad for Committee Stage in the coming weeks.</p><p>I recognise that the time-lag in terms of ramping up supply to match demand is fuelling a marked increase in rents, especially in Dublin and the other major cities, leading to difficulties, particularly for lower-income households.  I am monitoring the rental market closely and am keeping potential policy options under review. My overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

housing units, will support approved housing bodies to provide units via the Capital Assistance Scheme for special needs situations and will support the return of vacant properties to productive use. I have already announced, on 5 May 2015, the first major social housing construction programme under the Social Housing Strategy. This announcement covers some 100 separate housing projects, to provide over 1,700 new social housing units across all 31 local authorities.

This will also be accompanied by the targeted assistance of 28,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), to provide supported accommodation in the private rented sector.</p><p>Of the &euro;1.5 billion funding to enable the delivery of the Social Housing Strategy targets, &euro;312 million has now been assigned to specific housing projects, which will provide a kick start to the direct-build local authority social housing programme. It is important to recognise that direct build is just one of a suite of delivery mechanisms and this is the first announcement, with further approvals to be announced in due course.</p><p>This first phase announcement of some 100 housing projects will deliver some 1,700 units across all 31 local authorities by 2017. The specific details, including funding and the number of units to be constructed in each local authority area are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>The impact of the projects on waiting lists varies from local authority to local authority with up to 7% of the list covered in some local authorities and 2% covered on average nationally. However, further project approvals will be announced on a phased basis throughout the year as further assessments are completed. It is my intention that all of the projects already announced will be completed by 2017, at latest. The overall social housing targets and expenditure out to 2017, that I announced on 1 April 2015, will on average nationally have a 25% impact on housing waiting lists.</p><p>Local authorities are responsible for the detailed planning and social housing provision, at a local level, based on the identified need in their areas. It is a matter for each local authority, working with my Department, to identify and bring forward appropriate proposals to respond to the local housing need including consideration of options to acquire available properties, new building developments, leasing and the provision of housing supports through the private rental sector.</p></reply>

Local authority dwellings falling outside of this set of circumstances are unlikely to have a BER certificate.

BER Certificates also have a validity period of 10 years and will cease to be represented on the national database once this period has expired.</p><p>My Department continues to pursue an ongoing programme of investment in improving the energy efficiency of the existing stock of social housing owned by local authorities and has published the best practice design guidelines <i>Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities</i>which, among other things, promote higher standards of energy efficiency in new social housing.

Funding of &euro;50 million is being provided over the period 2013-2015 for improving the energy performance of older local authority housing stock.

This subvention will be paid in respect of the child allowance (21,000 litres per child per annum), a product subsidy and capping domestic water charges. In addition, provision has been made for the provision of a working capital loan to Irish Water of up to &euro;96m in 2015.</p></reply>

The Strategy incorporates 75 specific actions encompassing the development of an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision. </p><p>I have responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the <i>Construction 2020 Strategy</i>on behalf of the Government and in the period since its publication, we have already begun to see some welcome and positive signs of recovery in the sector. Particularly notable in this regard are the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure, and announcements of committed funding of &euro;3.8 billion towards the provision of 35,000 social housing units in the period to 2020. I will continue to liaise with representatives of the construction industry and other stakeholders in relation to the implementation of further measures to assist in the development of a strong and sustainable construction sector, particularly in the area of housing construction.</p><p>The only matters in the list of measures proposed by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in its 12 steps to increase employment in the construction sector by 20,000 jobs that fall under my area of responsibility are the Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill and the placing of the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing.</p><p>The General Scheme of the Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill was published in January of this year and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. It provides for the implantation of the primary planning-related recommendation of the Mahon Tribunal, namely the establishment of a new Office of the Planning Regulator. It also provides for:</p><p>-  a legislatively defined approach to the development of a successor strategy to the 2002 National Spatial Strategy,</p><p>-  the National Planning Framework, and</p><p>-  enhanced transparency in, and streamlining of, the planning system, with regard to -</p><p>-  the publication of all submissions received on local area plans and development plans on the website of the relevant planning authority,</p><p>-  the Chief Executive&rsquo;s report on such submissions to be also published on the website of the relevant planning authority,</p><p>-  the forwarding of any proposed grants of planning permission in material contravention of a local area plan or development plan to the relevant regional assembly for observations,  </p><p>-  the provision of legislative underpinning for E-Planning to facilitate the introduction of online planning applications and appeals,</p><p>-  the payment of reduced fees, or no fees, by elected members when making submissions on applications for planning permission, and the noting of such representations on the relevant planning file,</p><p>-  the taking into account by Irish Water of the likely sequencing of housing and economic development as indicated in local area plans and development plans when preparing its Water Services Strategic Investment Plan.</p><p>In addition to the provisions outlined in the General Scheme as published, it is also proposed to introduce a number of further amendments at Committee Stage of the Bill to address a range of issues, including the streamlining of the existing provisions relating to the taking in charge of housing estates by local authorities, and improving the procedures relating to the designation of Strategic Development Zones.</p><p>The General Scheme of the Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill is being progressed in parallel with a General Scheme for a Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill aimed primarily at addressing the current constrained housing supply situation, which is particularly acute in the Dublin area. The main provisions in the Planning (No. 1) Bill are:</p><p>- revision of the Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing,</p><p>- retrospective application of reduced development contribution charges, and</p><p>- the introduction of a vacant site levy to incentivise urban regeneration and the provision of housing in central urban areas. </p><p>The Government has also signalled its commitment in the <i>Construction 2020 Strategy</i>to placing the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing in 2015. This is seen as an essential consumer protection measure giving consumers who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator. Legislative proposals in this regard are currently being prepared by my Department with a view to their being presented to Government for consideration in the near future.</p></reply>

This is in line with Government policy to ensure that local government is well positioned to support the effective and efficient delivery of local and rural development. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, funding under the new LEADER programme for the 2014-2020 period has been allocated based on administrative or county boundaries  . In view of the size of the Cork County Council area, there will be three sub-regional areas for that County. This will mean a total of 28 sub-regional areas in Ireland for LEADER purposes. It will be the responsibility of the Local Action Group to determine the eligible areas within individual administrative areas for the purposes of their Local Development Strategy. </p>  <p>  Under the EU regulatory framework governing the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, each EU Member State must conduct an open and transparent process to select both the Local Development Strategies and the Local Action Group(s) for each sub-regional area. Accordingly, my Department is conducting a two stage process.  The first stage, which is an Expressions of Interest (EOI) stage, was recently launched and any entity wishing to be considered as a Local Action Group for their area has until 15 May 2015 to submit an EOI. This stage is open to any entity that can show broad local and community participation and that has a coherent vision for the development of their area. </p>  <p>  Local Action Groups successful in the first stage of the process will in turn be invited and supported to design a Local Development Strategy for their area in stage two of the process, which I envisage will begin in the early part of the 3rd quarter of this year.   </p>  <p>  In line with Government policy, it is intended to select a single strategy in each area. Where more than one group qualifies through stage one of the process the groups involved will be encouraged to come together in partnership to jointly prepare and agree a single strategy in order to ensure that the most comprehensive and coherent strategies come forward for consideration and approval. In the event that more than one strategy is ultimately submitted, it will be a matter for the Independent Evaluation Committee to a make a recommendation regarding the most appropriate strategy.   </p>  <p>  As the selection process for the new Programme will be an open process, I cannot say what entities will be successful, or how these might differ from the 2007-2013 LEADER arrangements.   </p>  <p>  I expect that some Local Development Strategies will be operational and that funding of these Local Development Strategies will be available by Autumn 2015. It is at this point that local groups and businesses will be able to apply to the designated Local Action Group in their area for funding to support specific projects. </p></reply>

This builds on practical experience, over many years, in the local government sector of local authorities co-operating in the performance of functions and the delivery of services, including on a regional basis. </p><p>To drive the reform agenda, and in particular shared service initiatives, in the local government sector, a dedicated Programme Management Office (PMO) has been established which reports to a high-level Oversight Group. The roll out of shared services and process improvements across the sector is supported by the use of shared expertise, a shared technical infrastrucutre supported by the Local Government Management Agency and a singular local government web portal. </p><p>Overall, 31 operational areas have been identified for examination for potential as a shared service or other collaborative approach that may provide efficiencies. The PMO has adopted a comprehensive methodology for the development and evaluation of projects including gathering and analysing baseline data, business case preparation and peer review of business cases. </p><p>Payroll/Superannuation, Building Control, Treasury Management, Procurement and Accounts Payable have been prioritised in the shared services programme in the short to medium term and the programme is being progressed using a lead authority model. A number of other shared services are currently under development including services in debt management, veterinary services, road management systems and the register of electors. </p><p>Following a competitive bidding process in 2013, Laois County Council was selected to provide Shared Payroll and Superannuation services on behalf of all local authorities and has established a shared services centre for that purpose in Portlaoise. This shared service commenced in January 2014 and all local authorities will transition to it in waves in the period to 2016. </p><p>In relation to procurement, the local authority sector is working closely with the Office of Government Procurement to deliver significant savings over the coming years. The table below shows the costs associated with each project to date, as well as the anticipated benefits. No costs were incurred for these projects prior to 2013.<table><tr><th>Project</th><th>-</th><th>Costs </th><th>Benefits </th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>2013 </td><td>2014 </td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>MyPay (shared payroll and superannuation) </td><td>&euro;1,345,606 <br /><br /></td><td>&euro; 1,784,549 <br /><br /></td><td>-  &euro;4.3M savings per annum anticipated. <br /><br />&bullet;  Project Net Present Value (NPV) &euro;27,839,444 and Pay Back 7 years. <br /><br />-  Creation of a Centre Of Excellence for Payroll and Superannuation to service Local Government staff and pensioners. <br /><br />-  In order to realise the savings from the Shared Service Centre, surplus staff will need to be redeployed.

The EU aims to deliver a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions and 20% of our energy coming from renewable sources by 2020.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s 2020 strategy is set firmly in the global and European contexts. Our objectives accord with the policy objectives set by the European Union. These are grounded in the economic, environmental and supply security imperatives to decarbonise energy systems and diversify energy sources by fundamentally de-coupling energy from reliance on fossil fuels.</p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy and Ireland has made significant progress with regard to renewable energy deployment. To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. </p>  <p>  The REFIT schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including small scale hydro, biomass and wind. Solar PV, wave energy, or geothermal are not supported by the REFIT schemes.</p>  <p>  Given the emerging policy context and the requirements of the EU target market for electricity, my Department is beginning the process of developing a new support scheme for electricity, to be available from 2016 onwards. A key component of this will be consideration of all available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of support required. </p>  <p>  As regards energy efficiency, my Department is continuing to develop and enhance policy in this area and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is continuing to implement policy with the roll out of efficiency measures in homes and businesses throughout the country.</p></reply>

In relation to my Department, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland (OSI) will be merged with the Property Registration Authority and the Valuation Office which will, this year, see it transfer to the Department of Justice and Equality, who are leading on the transfer process. Medium term savings are likely to be achievable in the areas of common back office functions such as HR, conventional (non-specialised) IT systems, Financial Management and Corporate Services. There may also be potential savings in the areas of accommodation and software licences. In the longer term, greater efficiencies/synergies in delivery of the merged organisation&rsquo;s services may lead to further savings in operational areas. Additional commercial revenues which would reduce the burden on the State may also be achievable in the medium to long term.</p>  <p>  On 14 January last, the Government approved my Department&rsquo;s proposals for the merger of Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) with Dublin City Council (DCC) by means of an independent company, wholly owned by DCC, and the drafting of Heads of Bill to effect the merger. Drafting of the necessary legislative provisions to provide for the dissolution of the DHDA and the transfer of assets, functions and responsibilities to DCC is being progressed. </p>  <p>  There is provision for certain back-office administrative functions of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to be merged. It should be noted that neither BAI nor ComReg is Exchequer funded and any savings achieved would not reduce Exchequer expenditure.</p></reply>

A new Energy Policy Paper which will set out Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy up to 2030 is being developed. To facilitate the development of the new Policy Paper, a Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland was published in May 2014 commencing a written public consultation process that concluded on 31 July last.</p>  <p>  Over 1,200 submissions were received in the written consultation process. In addition, there was a targeted stakeholder consultation process involving 11 seminars with six on the priorities identified in the Green Paper, four regional seminars and a seminar on costs. My Department is now focused on finalising the detailed work required to produce the a definitive energy policy statement which I aim to publish in September 2015.</p>  <p>  The future of the Whitegate oil refinery is primarily a commercial matter for the current owners of the refinery, Phillips 66. My Department commissioned a study into the strategic case for oil refining requirements on the island of Ireland which was published in July 2013. The key conclusion at that time was that the presence of an operational refinery on the island of Ireland provides flexibility, enhancing the options available to the State in the event of an oil supply disruption, by providing an alternative source of product thus mitigating a complete reliance on product imports. In light of that conclusion, the Government had agreed that my Department would liaise with the Irish oil industry and appropriate public bodies to determine any policy options that might facilitate the commercial future of refining in Ireland. I expect to be in a position to brief Government on the available policy options shortly.</p></reply>

Enhanced air access to key tourism and business markets such as China has always been a key element of Ireland's aviation policy.</p>  <p>  The Irish airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available to help support new services.

In this regard, my Department conducted a critical examination of the structure and operation of the institutions included in the Public Service Reform Plan and developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area.  Savings were made primarily in three ways</p>  <p>- Through the ending of payments to Chairpersons and members of boards or advisory councils</p>  <p>- Through a programme of shared services between institutions, including, for example, in retail, security, marketing, procurement and storage and</p>  <p>- Through the provision of human resources services by my Department to the National Museum of Ireland, thus eliminating the need to incur a cost in accessing these services.</p>  <p>  The functions of Culture Ireland were merged fully into my Department during 2013 and the Board was replaced with an Expert Committee whose members provide their time on a pro bono basis.  In addition, the term of office of the Placenames Commission expired in October 2012 and was in turn replaced by an Expert Committee which also operates on a pro bono basis.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a formal Framework for Co-operation and Improved Services between the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery was developed and endorsed by Government.  Arising from that, the three Galleries signed a formal Service Level Agreement outlining a number of specific measures to share a number of services across the three Institutions.  In addition, legislation is being prepared to update corporate governance in the Galleries, to reduce the numbers on their boards and provide for pro bono service and gender equality on each board.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this programme of change has made a significant contribution to achieving the overall &euro;20 million savings target set out in the Public Service Reform Plan, while at the same time enhancing the operations of the bodies concerned.</p></reply>

The 1987 Act sets out the statutory provisions in relation to the general use of metal detectors to search for archaeological objects on any lands and the particular requirements applying to their use or possession on protected monuments and archaeological sites.  My Department, in co-operation with the National Museum of Ireland, has published guidelines setting out advice to the public on use of detection devices and their impact on our archaeological heritage.  The guidelines are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and are also available in museums, libraries, local authority offices, etc.  The guidelines explain both the provisions of the relevant legislation and the reasons why it was enacted in 1987.  The 1987 Act does not prohibit the use of metal detectors for archaeological purposes, rather it ensures that such use takes place in a regulated manner, subject to appropriate safeguards.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current legislation is both reasonable and proportionate and I have no proposals to introduce the type of scheme envisaged by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, has provided just over &euro;2.1 million since 2002 for works to Russborough House.  In 2005, the Heritage Council published the Conservation Plan for Russborough House as a first step in providing a framework and vision for the estate into the future.  My Department, through the Local Authority Conservation Grants Scheme, also provided &euro;8,000 to fund conservation works at Russborough House in 2010.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.
