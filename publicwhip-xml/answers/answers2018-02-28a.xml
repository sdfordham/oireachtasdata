My responsibility relates to the conservation status of the hare.</p>  <p>  In August last year, my Department issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, covering some 87 affiliated coursing clubs, to capture and tag hares for use at regulated hare coursing meetings for the 2017/18 season, which extends from the end of September 2017 to the end of February 2018.  Those licences contained a total of 22 conditions which have been developed and refined over the years.  Subsequently, in October last year, my Department augmented the licencing conditions to provide for more strict regulation of coursing trials. </p>  <p>  Veterinary staff from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine carry out inspections during the coursing season to monitor compliance with the rules governing animal welfare relating to greyhounds and hares.  The Irish Coursing Club also attends local coursing meetings.  In addition, where resources allow, local National Parks and Wildlife Service Conservation Rangers from my Department attend coursing meetings, on a spot-check basis, to monitor compliance with licences issued to the ICC and its affiliated clubs.      </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that some twenty six coursing events were monitored by officials of my Department during the current 2017/18 season, including trials.  In the 2016/17 season there were a total of 17 coursing events monitored by my Department and the same number were monitored in the previous year.  The increase from 17 events monitored in each of the previous two seasons to 26 in the current season marks an appreciable increase in the level of monitoring carried out and I will keep this matter under review with a view to increasing further the amount of resources I can devote to our monitoring role. The increased monitoring will allow for a more incisive review of the season just over. It will also assist in a more informed approach to the licensing of the next season.</p>  <p>  The final event of the coursing season took place last Sunday 25th  February.  All reports in relation to the season will be reviewed and all issues arising, including possible breaches of conditions, will be investigated and considered in the context of licenses for the 2018/19 coursing season.</p></reply>

In all this totals about 87,000 hectares and hundreds of kilometres of trails.</p>  <p>  The NPWS is responsible for the maintenance of trails and pathways within the Parks and Reserves, as well as the provision of amenity, conservation, interpretation, scientific and visitor services.  Through its participation the National Outdoor Recreation Group, an ad-hoc group of public service recreational infrastructure providers, such as Coillte, Bord na Mona, OPW and Waterways Ireland, its drives interconnection and co-operation between these entities.</p>  <p>  Within their own counties, Local Authorities are responsible for the provision and development of the infrastructure instanced by the Deputy.  Of particular note in that regard is the wonderful project on Waterford's coastline opened last year, an initiative driven by Waterford County Council. In that respect, the two Government Departments with primary funding responsibility are the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Rural and Community Affairs.  In that respect, the Rural Recreation Schemes and Leader Programmes operated under the aegis of the latter Department are a particular point of reference.</p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  I will also be investing in conservation measures in designated habitats.</p>  <p>  Our National Parks and National Reserves are of course a substantial part of the network of protected areas required under the Habitats Directive and my Department  will shortly finalise a masterplan for investment in the Parks and Reserves, ensuring their protection, while providing for enhanced visitor amenities so that Irish and overseas visitors can have an increased awareness of and access to nature and its value. </p>  <p>  The prioritization of this investment is driven by the interlinked objectives of community, amenity, conservation and well-being.  This is, I believe, the first time a National Development Plan has placed the biodiversity and natural capital agenda at its core and I look forward to delivering on our ambitious targets in that regard.</p></reply>

I have also reaffirmed my continued commitment to measures aimed at eliminating workplace harassment in the arts and culture sector</p>  <p>  Last November, my predecessor met with leaders of Irish theatre organisations who had co-signed a statement condemning sexual harassment and abuse of power in theatre in Ireland.  The meeting focused on how the theatre sector could come together to discuss the issues that have arisen. It was agreed that my Department would assist in any practical arrangements in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department has since worked with the Irish Theatre Institute with a view to putting in place a series of actions that will find an appropriate way forward for the Theatre sector on this sensitive topic. </p>  <p>  As a result the Institute will be hosting a one-day event for artists and organisations on March 21st in Liberty Hall, Dublin.  Entitled Speak Up And Call It Out: Establishing a code of conduct for Irish theatre, the purpose of this event is to work towards the elimination of abuse of power and to safeguard the future health and wellbeing and career potential of those working in the sector by providing a code of conduct.  A programme for the day will be announced on March 8th, International Women&rsquo;s Day. </p>  <p>  I hope that the output from the conference can be incorporated into existing measures in the not-for-profit sector while also considering if there are additional measures that can be taken for those who operate outside any organised structure.</p>  <p>  In relation to the wider cultural sector, my Department will be organising governance workshops for the organisations that come under my direct remit.  The Department is also liaising with the Arts Council in relation to the provision of similar training to all other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country through a series of regional information days.</p>  <p>  There has to be a clear message accepted universally that a culture of dignity and respect at work is expected as a basic human right everywhere, regardless of the workplace.</p></reply>

Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe promotes the Irish language through plays, workshops and exhibitions.  It is in receipt of an annual operational grant of &euro;320,00 to support the delivery of the theatre&rsquo;s work programme.</p>  <p>- The National Folk Theatre, Siamsa Tire will receive funding of &euro;310,000 my Department in 2018.  Siamsa Tire is headquartered in Tralee and has two subsidiary "Tithe Siamsa" in Finuge and Carraig (Dingle).  It brings to life Irish folklore through music, song and dance.  Its own productions are delivered over five months in summer and are delivered almost exclusively through the Irish language sung rather than spoken.</p>  <p>- In relation to other funded theatres, including the Abbey Theatre, these are supported by the Arts Council and my Department does not have a direct role in relation to them.  I am aware that a number of theatrical organisations actively include the use of Irish language in their work.</p>  <p>- I note that the Abbey Theatre in its mission statement makes a commitment  "to lead in the telling of the whole Irish story, in English and in Irish" and it affirms "that the Abbey is a theatre for the entire island of Ireland and for all its people."</p>  <p>- Applications for Arts Council funding schemes are open to applicants through the medium of Irish and English and the Council operates funding schemes based around the Irish language including literature as well as funding artists and organisations in Gaeltacht areas under the Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta scheme.</p>  <p>- In December last year, the Taoiseach launched the Bliain na Gaeilge programme a major celebration marking the 125th anniversary of the start of the Irish language revival movement in 2018 in which people with all levels of Irish are invited participate.  Events will be organised around five key themes - the revival of the language over the last 125 years; the creativity of the language; the vibrancy of the language; the participation of the community and the value of the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>- I will be encouraging all bodies under the aegis of my Department to promote Irish during Bliain na Gaeilge, including as part of the Creative Ireland Programme.</p></reply>

This project has been titled Beyond 2022?.  </p><p>The Beyond 2022 team is working to assemble a complete inventory of loss and survival of the 1922 fire. In doing so, the team has identified ten main categories of surviving or substitute sources:</p><p>- Survivors: records that survived almost unscathed because they were held in the Reading Room of the Public Record Office, not the Record Treasury itself</p><p>- Salved records: records damaged by the fire, but not completely destroyed, now in varying states of conservation</p><p>- Duplicates of original records now held in partner archives</p><p>- Facsimile images made before 1922</p><p>- Antiquarian transcripts</p><p>- Printed editions</p><p>- Certified copies</p><p>- Published calendars summarizing the contents of the records</p><p>- Unpublished calendars in manuscript form</p><p>- Legal abstracts </p><p>- The aim is to gather into a single database all the information from surviving and substitute sources from archives and libraries in Ireland and internationally.  The entire archive will be fully searchable, with its contents ranging from basic descriptions to fully restored records ranging in date from the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries.  It will not be possible to digitally restore the full contents of the Record Treasury, but visitors to this virtual archive will now be able to see what the archive held before its destruction and a large amount of material that thankfully was either copied, duplicated or transcribed to other sources.</p></reply>

I have also reaffirmed my continued commitment to measures aimed at eliminating workplace harassment in the arts and culture sector.</p>  <p>  Last November, my predecessor met with leaders of Irish theatre organisations who had co-signed a statement condemning sexual harassment and abuse of power in theatre in Ireland.  The meeting focused on how the theatre sector could come together to discuss the issues that have arisen.  It was agreed that my Department would assist in any practical arrangements in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department has since worked with the Irish Theatre Institute with a view to putting in place a series of actions that will find an appropriate way forward for the Theatre sector on this sensitive topic. </p>  <p>  As a result the Institute will be hosting a one-day event for artists and organisations on March 21st in Liberty Hall, Dublin. Entitled Speak Up And Call It Out: Establishing a code of conduct for Irish theatre, the purpose of this event is to work towards the elimination of abuse of power and to safeguard the future health and wellbeing and career potential of those working in the sector by providing a code of conduct.  A programme for the day will be announced on March 8th, International Women&rsquo;s Day. </p>  <p>  I hope that the output from the conference can be incorporated into existing measures in the not-for-profit sector while also considering if there are additional measures that can be taken for those who operate outside any organised structure.</p>  <p>  In relation to the wider cultural sector, my Department will be organising governance workshops for the organisations that come under my direct remit.  The Department is also liaising with the Arts Council in relation to the provision of similar training to all other cultural organisations and arts centres around the country through a series of regional information days. </p>  <p>  There has to be a clear message accepted universally that a culture of dignity and respect at work is expected as a basic human right everywhere, regardless of the workplace.</p></reply>

The scheme supports heritage projects across the country and creates employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas, and is co-ordinated by each local authority.   My Department has allocated &euro;2m under the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2018, of which &euro;50,000 is the indicative amount for County Kildare. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  Local authorities have submitted applications to my Department and they will shortly be assessed by an expert panel. Successful applicants will be notified by their local authority shortly thereafter.  My Department has allocated &euro;1,324,000 under the Structures at Risk Fund 2018.

I hope to be in a position to notify local authorities in respect of both schemes by the end of March.</p></reply>

I was very pleased to hear from the Chair of the Advisory Group in the last few days of the constructive meeting he and the Oireachtas members of the Group, including the Deputy, had with the owners last week.  I believe that this is the appropriate way in which to address the issues relating to the site and its wider environs. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that a  foundation and framework has now been laid for positive and fruitful co-operation, dialogue and interaction between all the key interests in Moore Street under the aegis of the Moore Street Advisory Group.  I would encourage the Deputy to continue to engage and contribute to that process through his membership of the Group.</p></reply>

Under article 6.4 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest and where there are no suitable alternatives. </p>  <p>  14 sites have been identified by the Department, after consultation with turf cutting representatives, as suitable for investigation for the possible utilisation of Article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive &ndash; a list of these sites is included in the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022. Coolrain Bog special area of conservation is included on this list. </p>  <p>  Scientific contractors engaged by my Department have undertaken a preliminary review of the eco-hydrological conditions present on this site to examine the potential for continued turf-cutting there in accordance with the provisions of the Directive.  A separate Raised Bog Monitoring and Assessment Survey report was prepared to outline the current ecological condition and location of active raised bog habitat and other raised bog habitats, listed in Annex 1 of the Directive, on the site. </p>  <p>  The results of these studies, amongst those for other sites, are being considered by my Department within the framework of the National Plan.</p></reply>

This lists all the events and activities taking place in Ireland under the EYCH 2018 banner and will be updated with new events throughout the year.</p>  <p>  The best way for local groups to get involved with the year is to submit their planned events that fit the theme 'Make a Connection' to the Heritage Council through the dedicated website EYCH2018.ie. Successful submissions will be granted the EYCH label, added to the online events calendar and promoted on social media.</p>  <p>  Regarding available funding, the Heritage Council's Community Grant Scheme for this year has focused on the European Year of Cultural Heritage theme 'Make a Connection', with up to &euro;750,000 to be allocated to voluntary and community groups to build heritage connections that will last beyond 2018.  Applications for this Scheme closed earlier this month, and I look forward to announcing the successful projects with the Heritage Council in due course.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Heritage Council is planning a special initiative, &lsquo;Le Ch&eacute;ile san Eoraip&rsquo;, to be coordinated with local authority heritage officers and community groups to research heritage links &ndash; literary, historical, craft, architectural, linguistic, etc. &ndash; between their community and a community in another European country.</p></reply>

The EU Commission's award is &euro;1.5m.</p>  <p>  My Department officials continue to work and support the newly formed Galway 2020 Company with the preparations for delivery of the programme, "Making Waves".  The Board of Galway 2020 Company is now finalised following a skills set analysis and  Dr. Aideen Mc Ginley has been appointed as Chairperson, with Declan McGonagle serving as my Department's representative. </p>  <p>  The Board comprises a  very broad range of experts striking a balance between artistic and governance expertise.  On 17th January, this year, I met with the CEO Ms. Hannah Kiely, and I have accepted an invitation to meet with the wider team of Galway2020 in the not too distant future. </p>  <p>  I also note that the new P&aacute;l&aacute;s art house cinema, largely funded by my Department, will also add significantly to the cultural infrastructure of Galway in advance of the Capital of Culture and that it will be a major asset for hosting events during Galway 2020 and beyond.</p></reply>

This is the most significant investment in cultural infrastructure in a decade with funding provided to a range of facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.

The objective of this process is to give interested parties the opportunity to submit their views and ideas around how the events between 1918 and 1923 might be appropriately and respectfully remembered, in line with the principles expressed in the Second Statement of the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations.  The public consultation process was originally due to close on 31st January 2018 and the closing date was extended until today (28th February) to give all interested parties who would like to make submissions the opportunity to do so.  Over 50 submissions have been received to date and the Expert Advisory Group will consider these submissions in providing their advice and guidance to Government. </p>  <p>  The number of staff involved in planning, preparing and delivering State commemorations up to 2021 will vary depending on the volume and intensity of the work on hand but currently stands at a core team of seven staff.  This team also liaises with relevant colleagues in a number of other Government Departments including the Departments of the Taoiseach, Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Education &amp;amp; Skills, along with the Office of Public Works as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Commemoration Programme comprises four thematic strands commemorating the significant historical event which took place in 1918:</p>  <p>  - the death of John Redmond and the decline of the Irish Parliamentary Party</p>  <p>  - the end of World War 1</p>  <p>  - the introduction of voting rights for women and their right to stand in Parliamentary elections</p>  <p>  - the emergence and divergence of Irish identity in 1918.</p></reply>

At contract renewal stage personnel must fulfil certain criteria. These criteria relate to service, conduct, training and also minimum standards of medical and physical fitness.  Personnel who do not meet these standards are ineligible for contract renewal. </p>  <p>  In relation to renewal of contracts, I am advised that it would also be necessary to examine the individual medical files of each individual who left the Air Corps to determine if any person was refused a contract renewal as a result of incompatible medical fitness.

We have participated in all aspects of the CSDP since it was established and are one of the leading contributors to CSDP Operations, both military and civil. </p>  <p>  Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) is a further initiative in strengthening the Union&rsquo;s capacity in this regard and developments in CSDP have been supported by the UN Secretary General as potentially providing additional capabilities for UN mandated operations. </p>  <p>  While not changing Ireland&rsquo;s existing security and defence arrangements, participation in PESCO will enhance our military capabilities for participation in UN mandated peace support operations; enhance interoperability and, working with our EU partners thereby ensure that our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training.  PESCO will also facilitate burden-sharing of the costs of capability development across a number of like-minded Member States by enabling participating countries to come together voluntarily and - on a project by project basis &ndash; to jointly develop military crisis management capabilities for use in CSDP operations and missions.   It was for these reasons that I sought Government approval last November to participate in PESCO, followed by D&aacute;il approval in December. </p>  <p>  Our participation in PESCO involves no commitment to participate in any CSDP operation or to the development of any form of common military force.  It goes without saying that any future potential Irish participation in EU missions or operations will be considered within the framework of the Irish Constitution and Irish law and that there is no change to the current triple lock arrangements in regard to the deployment of Irish military personnel overseas. </p>  <p>  In considering potential future operations regard will also be had to the prevailing demands on the Defence Forces, our overseas commitments and available resources and the nature and mandate of the operation foreseen.</p></reply>

The legislation is being brought forward by my colleague the Minister for Health.  Persons who do not meet the medical criteria for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme may qualify for the proposed Transport Support Scheme.</p></reply>

However, a portion of any such refund due, may be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta's assets on completion of the liquidation process. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my decision in principle that the State will ensure that Setanta third party claimants are compensated in full, which was announced on 30 January.  The Department of Finance is now working through the detailed arrangements to implement this decision, which is likely to require legislative change.  In this regard, the next step is to give consideration as to whether there is any state aid or other legal issue associated with the proposed approach.  The Department is currently working with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on this issue and once the position is clarified I can give an indication of the likely timeline for payment, including the payment of the additional 35% to those who have settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim subject to the limit outlined above.</p>  <p>  The liquidator for Setanta Insurance has informed me that as of 31 December 2017, there are 1,577 active claims, of these 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limit.</p>  <p>  No date has been fixed for the next payment from the ICF, but the Liquidator has informed me that preparatory work is underway in respect of some 275 claims to the value of c &euro;5.8m, with a view to the Accountant to the High Court making an application before the end of March.  These payments will be paid subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limit. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that only claims which have been settled can be included in applications to the High Court for payment from the ICF.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.  It is hoped that by the State taking steps to ensure that third party claimants are compensated in full, this will encourage the settlement of all outstanding claims as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

In addition, it is not known to whom the loans will be sold.  However, I want and expect PTSB to be transparent with their customers when it comes to this sale process as it evolves.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that there are no changes to the rights or obligations of a customer whose loan is sold by a bank.  All terms and conditions attached to their mortgage contract remain in place.  In addition, as credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated entities are required to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), all protections under the CCMA are unchanged.  The customer is in the exact same position as they were before their loan was sold.  In relation specifically to restructured loans, including splits, any purchaser will be obliged to honour the terms of the restructure agreement, should such loans be included in the final sale. </p>  <p>  It is also clear that these restructured loans, where customers are meeting the terms of the revised contract, fall into a very different category than the others. These customers are in a much stronger position in every sense and hence the interested buyer of these restructured loans could be very different as a result.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would reiterate that I am prepared to engage with Deputies from other parties in an effort to see if we can strengthen and enhance the protections that are already in place for mortgage holders in a sensible manner.</p></reply>

During the height of the financial crisis a key focus of the authorities was on stabilising and ultimately reducing mortgage arrears through the implementation of sustainable mortgage solutions that were agreed with borrowers. </p><p>This led to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) introducing public mortgage arrears resolution targets (MART) for the banks in H1 2013.  As the MART process was rolled out a split mortgage solution or a part capital and interest solution that met certain criteria were accepted by the CBI as being sustainable for the purposes of these targets.  </p><p>Following the successful achievement of these targets by each of the banks, and since the implementation of the SSM in November 2014, the focus has shifted from the question of mortgage arrears levels and banks' progress in restructuring loans. In fact regulatory attitudes have not only hardened but have changed.  This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict definition of what constitutes an NPL.  </p><p>Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016 and discussed NPLs.  In the course of their discussions they outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and questioned the logic of now classifying some types of restructured loans as NPL, and not just for a short probationary period but indefinitely. </p><p>While my Department has been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.  </p><p>Aside from direct interaction with the SSM, Department officials have also been actively involved in the discussions on NPLs through its involvement in the European Council&rsquo;s Financial Services Committee subgroup on NPLs, and the more recent European Commission Expert Group on NPLs.  While this has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s views are voiced and considered on the matter, ultimately the final arbiter on the resolution of problem loans is the SSM.</p><p>The CBI has provided me with the following comment in relation to the Deputy's question:</p><p>&quot;In 2014, the European Banking Authority (EBA) introduced harmonized definitions of forbearance and non-performing exposures for supervisory reporting purposes (referred to as the ).  The definitions provide supervisors of European banks with comparable measures of asset quality and forbearance activities.  Banks are required to submit reporting templates (via FINREP) detailing their level of non-performing and forborne exposures in line with the EBA&rsquo;s definitions. </p><p>Paragraph 145 of the EBA&rsquo;s ITS on forbearance and non-performing exposures provides the definition of non-performing while paragraph 163 defines forbearance.  Exposures should be classified as non-performing and/or forborne if they meet the relevant criteria outlined in the ITS.  In relation to curing, paragraph 157 outlines the criteria required for a non-performing forborne exposure to move back to performing status.</p><p>Furthermore, in March 2017 the SSM published &ldquo;&rdquo; which sets out supervisory expectation regarding NPL identification, management, measurement and write-offs.  Information on the requirements to cure/exit from non-performing status is also provided, which utilises the ITS noted above. </p><p>Therefore, restructured NPLs can migrate back to performing when the criteria outlined in the EBA ITS has been satisfied, and it is the bank&rsquo;s responsibility to conduct that assessment.  Depending on the specificities of the restructure, it can take at least a year for a restructured NPL to move back to performing status.  Restructured NPLs successfully moving back to performing status is one of the important factors in improvements in mortgage NPL levels in recent years.&quot;</p></reply>

Therefore, the rental income received in respect of residential accommodation is not subject to VAT.</p>  <p>  However, prior to April 2007 a landlord could waive the exemption from VAT on rental income from residential property.  In those circumstances VAT was charged on the rental income from the property and the landlord was entitled to reclaim VAT on costs incurred in developing, acquiring or renovating that property.  Where such a waiver was exercised the rental income received continues to be liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%, and the landlord is obliged to account for that VAT in his or her VAT returns. </p>  <p>  The landlord may also avail of the waiver of exemption cancellation provisions set out in the VAT Consolidation Act, 2010 which results in the rental income being no longer subject to VAT.  However, cancelling the waiver may also result in a tax liability for the landlord where the input VAT recovered on acquisition or development of the residential property is greater than the output VAT on the rental income.</p></reply>

The methodology adopted to assess levels of disadvantage in schools is based on centrally held data with a uniform application across the entire school system to assess levels of disadvantage in Primary and Post-Primary schools.  A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at </p><p>The initial application of the model assessed all schools and found that most schools had pupils from disadvantaged areas but that the concentration of disadvantage varied significantly.  It is important to note that the Department's assessment is not based on the location of the school but on the CSO small areas statistics from which a school derives its pupil cohort.  Accordingly, the demographics of neighboring schools can differ in terms of assessed levels of need which are based on the pupil cohort within each school.</p><p>An update of the identification model is currently underway.  This will take account of updated school data as provided by schools for the current school year combined with the Pobal HP Index of Deprivation, based on CSO Small Area Population statistics derived from the 2016 National Census.  It is envisaged that this process will be completed by the end of Quarter 1 this year.</p><p>Should this exercise reveal that any school, including the school referred to by the Deputy, which did not qualify for DEIS in 2017 meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the updated information then additional schools may be included subject to available resources.</p></reply>

Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school, whereas for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required and for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  </p><p>The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision and they must be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.  SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.</p><p>The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents are encouraged to liaise with the local SENO to discuss placement options for their child.</p><p>Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of Special Educational Needs, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting, but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio and access to Special Needs Assistant support.</p><p>The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.  In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. </p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.  The NCSE has confirmed to my Department that the child to which the Deputy refers has never had access to SNA support allocated by the NCSE.</p><p>Details on the numbers of special classes and SNA allocations in each school per county for the 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18 school years are available on the NCSE's website at and respectively.</p><p>The number of special classes in Co Cork increased from 73 in 2011/12 to 221 in 2017/18 while the number of SNA posts increased from 1,454 in 2011/12 to 1807 in 2017/18.</p><p>The 2011/12 figures for special class numbers and SNA allocations are unavailable at the links above, therefore, I will arrange for the NCSE to reply directly to the Deputy with this information.</p></reply>

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.</p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within 3 months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-02-28a.273.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018022800032#WRG02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 to 122, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the High Court has jurisdiction in wards of court matters and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.  Furthermore, the Office of the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court is an Office of the High Court.</p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has assured me that it has received the report published on 22 February 2018 by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  The Courts Service has advised that it is currently considering the report and its recommendations insofar as they relate to the Courts Service, including the recommendation that an independent review be carried out of the Courts Service&rsquo;s disposition towards and interaction with wards and their families or guardians.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that it is committed to providing a high quality and professional service to all users of the courts and that their Customer Service Charter can be accessed on the Courts Service website, which sets out the standard of service that all of their customers can expect.   </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has informed me that, under current legislative provisions, when a person is taken into Wardship the President of the High Court appoints a Committee (usually one person) to deal with the Ward&rsquo;s property and, in certain cases, to make recommendations to the Registrar of the Wards of Court for the Ward&rsquo;s personal welfare or on items of expenditure.  These recommendations are taken into account when decisions are being taken on such issues. </p>  <p>  In approximately 75% of cases the Ward&rsquo;s Committee is a family member or trusted friend.  In cases where there is no suitable relative who is prepared to act, or where there is disagreement among the Ward&rsquo;s relatives which cannot be resolved, or where a conflict of interest arises, the Court may appoint the &ldquo;General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court&rdquo; to act as Committee.  In such cases, the General Solicitor is appointed as an independent committee to a Ward by the President of the High Court or other High Court judge. </p>  <p>  The Committee acts under the directions of the Court either personally or through their Solicitor.  In dealing with the affairs of a Ward of Court the General Solicitor is generally under a duty to ensure that confidentiality be afforded to a Ward.  There is also a relationship of solicitor/client confidentiality for General Solicitor cases which limits the type of communication she may have with others, even at times family members. </p>  <p>  The General Solicitor does, from time to time, seek information from family members and third parties when dealing with Ward's affairs.  In the majority of cases a family member or a trusted friend is appointed as the Ward's Committee.  In all cases the Wards of Court Office appoints a case officer to deal with the affairs of a ward of court and the case officer liaises and consults with the Committee in relation to the management of the Ward's affairs.</p></reply>

The ISI&rsquo;s mission is, by operating the statutory framework for personal insolvency solutions, to return insolvent people to solvency and full participation in social and economic activity.</p><p>The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) does not record information in relation to each individual financial institution.  However, the ISI issues quarterly statistics setting out the number of personal insolvency arrangements and the acceptance level by creditors in aggregate.  These statistics are published on the ISI website .  The specific data requested by the Deputy is not available in tabular form</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that, to date, the ISI has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) which deal with mortgage debt.  In over 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their homes.</p><p>The solutions introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 have also had an indirect impact on the number and quality of over 120,000 informal agreements between debtors and creditors, as reported by the Central Bank of Ireland. Because arrangements agreed under the Act are public and court approved, they set precedents for the terms of agreements that will be acceptable to a court.  Debtors now have realistic alternative options available to them through the ISI if negotiations break down.</p><p>The Section 115A court review process, introduced with effect from November 2015, permits a debtor to ask the court to review and assess the reasonableness of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement proposal which has been refused by creditors, and which includes mortgage arrears on the debtor's home.</p><p>Currently, there are over 500 such cases before the courts.  I am advised that a significant High Court judgment in early February addressed two key issues that had become a logjam in the process.  Namely, technical issues around the application for a court review and a fear from personal insolvency practitioners that creditors might pursue them for costs in a personal capacity.  I understand that these issues have now been adequately addressed.  The judgment has been positively received by both the Insolvency Service of Ireland and Personal Insolvency Practitioners.  Subject to any possible appeal, it is expected the judgment will lead to increased activity in Personal Insolvency Arrangements.</p><p>I can also advise the Deputy that Abhaile, the Government's national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, ensures that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner.  As of 23 February 2018, 8354 vouchers for professional financial advice and help on home mortgage arrears from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner have been issued through Abhaile.  Additionally, a borrower may apply for legal aid to the Legal Aid Board to seek a court review under section 115A where their proposed Personal Insolvency Arrangement had been rejected by the creditors.  Up to 23 February, legal aid had been approved under the Abhaile scheme for 607 such reviews brought under the personal insolvency legislation.</p></reply>

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage. The proposals seek to ensure that: &bullet;There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;&bullet;There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;&bullet;Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and&bullet;The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable. It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

When using GNI* as a complementary indicator, the R&amp;D intensity rate is estimated at 1.72% for 2016.</p>  <p>  The NDP indicative allocation of &euro;9.4 billion for the National Strategic Outcome &ldquo;A Strong Economy, supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills&rdquo; to be invested by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills, is very welcome.  It will support the delivery of key strategic investment priorities, including a Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, expansion of advanced manufacturing supports, new cycles for the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, expanding Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s budget for R&amp;D and strengthening SFI Research Centres and Enterprise Ireland / IDA Technology Centres in higher education in all regions.  While the precise timing of the rollout of the above initiatives has yet to be finalised, in time, this investment will play a key role in facilitating Ireland reaching its R&amp;D intensity target.</p></reply>

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage. The proposals seek to ensure that: &bullet;There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;&bullet;There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;&bullet;Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and&bullet;The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable. It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

I am very much committed to exploring mechanisms to encourage more individuals to switch to electric vehicles (EVs).  In fact, in the National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017-2030 published last year by my Department, we set a clear ambition that all new cars and vans sold in Ireland from 2030 onwards will be zero emission (or zero emission-capable).  (Available at<i></i>.  This ambition was reiterated in both the Government's National Mitigation Plan () and the recent National Development Plan 2018-2027 ().</p><p>In this regard, it may interest the Deputy to know that my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, jointly convened an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Task Force to consider a wide range of measures and options available to Government for the purpose of accelerating the deployment of low carbon technologies &ndash; specifically that of EVs.  The work of the Taskforce has been divided into three work streams focusing on: Market Growth Stimuli and Visibility (Working Group 1); Infrastructure, Energy Regulation and Pricing (Working Group 2); and Planning Legislation, Building Regulations and Public Leadership (Working Group 3).  Preliminary recommendations from the Taskforce were considered in the 2018 budgetary process and a suite of continued and new EV supports were subsequently announced.  A list of current incentives to promote EVs is presented in the table below and is promoted on the SEAI website ().  As you will see there is a particular focus on raising public awareness and promoting citizen engagement with EVs. </p><p>In terms of the number and location of publicly accessible charging stations, I understand that there are currently c. 1,200 charge points (79 fast chargers) available across the island of Ireland which is among the more comprehensive networks currently in place across Europe.  At present the fast charge points are primarily located on corridors that facilitate intercity travel.  However, during 2018 Working Groups 2 and 3 of the Taskforce will comprehensively consider the future development of the EV charging network as a key element to support greater EV use.  In relation to dedicated parking for EVs, under the Road Traffic Act 1994 it is a matter for each individual local authority to make bye-laws governing the type of paid parking controls in their jurisdictions.  However, the role of parking as an incentive is currently under consideration by Working Group 1 of the Taskforce and a series of stakeholder engagements with local authorities have already taken place.  The LEV Taskforce expects toreport its findings to Government in Q2 2018.</p><p>Finally, I was delighted to secure funding as part of Budget 2018 to help encourage the transition of our Taxi/Hackney/Limousine sector towards EVs.  This sector can play a vital role in championing the use of EVs to members of the public and in reducing harmful tailpipe emissions, particularly across our urban areas.  The grant scheme was launched on February 1st and is administered on behalf of my Department by the National Transport Authority (NTA). This scheme is available nationwide and supports both new and second-hand EVs. </p><p>Current Electric Vehicle Incentives<table><tr><th>Current Incentives</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>VRT Relief</td><td>Continuation of VRT relief in Budget 2018 -<br /><br />Up to &euro;5,000 for new EVs until end 2021   <br /><br />Up to &euro;2,500 for new PHEVs until end 2018</td></tr><tr><td>SEAI Grant Scheme</td><td>Continuation of SEAI Purchase Grant -  <br /><br />Up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new EV or PHEV</td></tr><tr><td>Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA)</td><td>EVs and charging infrastructure are qualifying equipment under the ACA scheme</td></tr><tr><td>Charging Supports</td><td>A new grant to support installation of home charger points for buyers of new and second-hand EVs from January 1st</td></tr><tr><td>SPSV Grant Scheme</td><td>A new grant and supporting measures to stimulate take-up of EVs in the taxi /hackney/limousine sector</td></tr><tr><td>0% Benefit-in-Kind (BIK)</td><td>A new BIK 0% rate to incentivise EVs without mileage conditions for at least three years</td></tr><tr><td>Public Body Procurement</td><td>National Procurement Service to introduce a new public procurement framework contract for EVs in 2018 to allow public bodies to buy EVs with reduced administrative burden</td></tr><tr><td>Public Engagement Programme</td><td>National awareness campaign  <br /><br />Driver experience roadshow  <br /><br />Public sector and commercial fleet trials  <br /><br />Support for EV use in car sharing trials</td></tr><tr><td>Toll Incentive Regime</td><td>A reduced tolling regime for EVs is expected to be introduced in 2018. </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The results of the public consultation will inform the final decisions to be made on the network redesign, Core Bus Corridors routes and park and ride facilities. The costs of the various elements of the overall BusConnects programme will be confirmed as part of the appropriate appraisal and procurement processes required under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

As outlined in the recently published 'National Development Plan 2018-2027, Project Ireland 2040' (NDP), the DART Expansion Programme is a series of projects that will create a full metropolitan area DART Network? for Dublin with all of the lines linked and connected over the period of the plan.  </p>  <p>  The initial sequencing of investment under the NDP will focus on delivery of non-underground tunnel elements of the Programme using the recently opened rail link and existing connector tunnel under the Phoenix Park (which has provided the option for Kildare commuters to access the city centre stations of Connolly, Tara Street and Pearse).  This sequencing and focus includes buying additional fleet for the DART network and measures such as re-signalling, junction and station changes to provide expanded services.  The next step will be to provide fast, high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda on the Northern Line, Celbridge/Hazelhatch on the Kildare Line, Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth/Sligo Line, while continuing to provide DART services on the South-Eastern Line as far south as Greystones.  It will also include new stations to provide interchange with bus, LUAS and Metro networks.</p>  <p>  The significant benefit to using the recently opened rail link and existing connector tunnel under the Phoenix Park and the proposed sequence of investment, is that it will enable additional passenger services to be put in place much earlier using existing infrastructure with some enhancements.  This integrated rail network will provide a core, high-capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Maynooth and Celbridge/Hazelhatch as well as Drogheda and Greystones.  The route for the remaining element of the overall DART Expansion Programme, the DART Underground Tunnel, will be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputies' questions to the Authority for further information on the issues raised.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

I secured funds in Budget 2018 which will allow Tusla to carry out the third year of a 3 year plan to provide for the allocation of a dedicated social worker to all children who need one.  Tusla are also funded to recruit family support workers, social care staff and administrative staff to work alongside social workers in supporting vulnerable children and families. </p><p>An unallocated case relates to a case about a child who is deemed to need a social work assessment, but has not yet been allocated to a social worker.  All urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team. The majority of  unallocated cases are new referrals, however they may also include children living with their families who had an allocated social worker, or to a child in care, where there is now a social work vacancy. </p><p>I am informed by Tusla that a case awaiting allocation may be listed as 'active on duty'. Tusla indicate that this may includes checking with professionals who see the child regularly, or visiting the child and family at home<b>,</b>getting additional information about the child's situation and, in some instances where a child is in care, organising a Care Plan Review and visiting the child. </p><p>Information about unallocated cases is published monthly on the Tusla website. The most up to date data available is for November 2017.  I can inform the Deputy that there were 24,445 open cases nationally at the end of November. Of these, 4,760 were awaiting allocation of a social worker. This information is provided in the table below, in the format requested by the Deputy. Tusla have experienced an increase of referrals to child protection and welfare services. There were 4,651 referrals received in November 2017, an increase of 749 (19%) on the same period in 2016.  </p><p>I, and my officials, will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and Senior Management Team to monitor and  review progress.</p><p>Cases open to Tusla social work awaiting allocation to a social worker, by Tusla Area</p><p><table><tr><th>Tusla Area </th><th>Number of cases awaiting allocation to a social worker </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin South East/Wicklow </td><td>105 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South West/Kildare/West Wicklow </td><td>805 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South Central </td><td>233 </td></tr><tr><td>Midlands </td><td>241 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North City </td><td>369 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North </td><td>462 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth/Meath </td><td>240 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan </td><td>234 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>107 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>605 </td></tr><tr><td>Carlow/Kilkenny/South Tipperary </td><td>255 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford/Wexford </td><td>232 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>467 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan </td><td>64 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway/Roscommon </td><td>185 </td></tr><tr><td>Midwest </td><td>156 </td></tr><tr><td>Total Cases</td><td>4,760</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am also advised that all other youth services operating in Dublin and in the rest of the country are not impacted by the Haddington Road agreement. </p>  <p>  Based on the information provided to my Department, the cost of implementing the Haddington Road agreement in these Dublin City services is more than offset by the increases provided to all youth services over the past two years. In 2016, all staff-led youth services were provided with a 2.5% increase in allocation. In 2017, services were provided with a 5% increase in their allocation. </p>  <p>  My Department has commenced a process with national organisations and local services, including Ballymun Regional Youth Service, to identify service development needs for 2018 and to finalise the 2018 allocations. The primary purpose of this process to ensure that youth services are sufficiently resourced to meet the needs of young people and particularly those who are at risk of drugs or alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities. Every effort will be made to complete this process as soon as possible and notify all youth services of their allocation for the year.</p>  <p>  In this regard, officials within my Department have recently met with and are continuing to work with officials from the City of Dublin Youth Service Board to identify service needs and emerging trends in Dublin City.</p></reply>

The carer may work or engage in training for a maximum of 15 hours per week and still be regarded as providing full-time care and attention.</p>  <p>  Only one carer's allowance is payable in respect of any one caring situation, however two carers who are sharing care in an established pattern can be accommodated on the carer's allowance scheme. All the usual qualifying conditions for carer's allowance apply to carers availing of these arrangements.  Each carer may share the carer's allowance income support payment and the annual carer&rsquo;s support grant. A carer providing full time care on a part time basis is required under legislation to provide care for a complete week i.e. Monday to Sunday. </p>  <p>  Other financial assistance may be available to the family.  Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is not means tested.  The family may also claim a Carer's Support Grant, which is paid each year during the month of June.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the current care sharing arrangements which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department. In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  </p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.  From October 2013 onwards, the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance. If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance then they will have to undergo a means test for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving fuel allowance to include carer&rsquo;s allowance would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating costs.  </p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to help identify people in energy poverty who are living with chronic respiratory conditions so they can avail of the Warmth and Well-being Scheme which aims to make homes warmer and healthier to live in.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 904,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;90 million.  </p><p>The scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State.  To qualify for the scheme, applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment.  These are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.  </p><p>A companion free travel pass entitles the pass holder to have any one person, aged 16 years or over, to accompany him/her free of charge when travelling.  In addition to this, people in receipt of carers allowance or benefit from my Department are also entitled to a free travel pass in their own right.  Therefore if the person being cared for has a companion travel pass they can nominate a person other than the carer to travel with them and the carer may travel on the single free travel pass they have received.</p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p><p>There are no plans at this time to increase the number of free travel companions that may travel without charge under the scheme.  Any such expansion would have significant budgetary implications, particularly if it was a general, rather than a targeted provision, such as that already provided for under the SWA travel supplement.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The companies are paid an initial registration fee and thereafter job sustainment fees only.  Job sustainment fees are only payable for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).  The Department was careful in designing the service to ensure that payments to contractors are conditional on people not just finding a job, but finding sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  The Agreements entered into between my Department and the JobPath companies include a provision for the engagement of sub-contractors in the delivery of the service.  The Agreements further provide that overall responsibility for the performance of the service contract, irrespective of whether the tasks are performed by the Contractor or through sub-contractors, rests with the Prime Contractors that is Seetec and Turas Nua.  </p>  <p>Turas Nua delivers the service directly to JobPath clients and has not engaged sub-contractors for the end to end delivery of the service.  Seetec provides the JobPath service directly and also through the following sub-contractors: Col&aacute;iste De Danann trading as Cenit College; Network Personnel; People 1st   Employment and Skills; CMD Group and Skills Team Employment Services. Any expenditure attaching to the provision of the service by these sub-contractors is a matter between Seetec and its sub-contractors.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, it is important to note that both companies engage a range of providers to deliver training and others supports to Jobseekers.</p></reply>

While there are nine points of review within the CWMF, my Department has combined these to just four for capital-funded social housing construction projects.</p><p>My Department now publishes Social Housing Construction Status Reports on a quarterly basis. These reports provide information on the social housing construction programme underway for each local authority area and contain details such as the stage each project is at, the names and locations of each project and the number of new social homes each project is delivering. </p><p>The last published report sets out the position at the end of quarter 3 of 2017. It has information on the delivery of over 12,000 new social housing homes, including those on site and under construction, those progressing through planning and design and those delivered in 2016 and to the end of quarter 3 of 2017. The majority of the schemes listed in the Status Report progress through the four stage process under the CWMF.  That report is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: </p><p><i></i></p><p>The construction schemes progressing through the 4 stage approval process are reviewed at each stage by my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Delivery team, including architectural and quantity surveyor (QS) advisors. The assessment of costs takes into account the wide range of factors that will influence projects, such as house or apartment type, location, land costs and conditions, scale of the development and the terms of the planning approval.  The professional QS staff assess costs in relation to all projects realistically, based on the range of the above factors that might apply and funding is released to local authorities based on the costs they have incurred in the delivery of the constructions projects. Local authorities are encouraged to drawdown funding on a timely basis.</p></reply>

A range of key design priorities are emphasised in the guidelines including the need to ensure designs are socially, environmentally and architecturally appropriate, safe, secure and healthy; affordable; durable; and accessible and adaptable. Such themes are amplified in the later Design Manual for Urban Spaces (DMURS).</p>  <p>  These design guidelines for local authorities seek to promote quality and value for money in publicly funded housing and seek to maintain this level of quality, including where other funding streams are fully or partially involved.</p>  <p>  In relation to the guidelines, my Department is in regular contact with Local Authorities where design proposals for social housing developments are considered for consistency with the Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities guidelines and I am satisfied that the appropriate arrangements are in place.</p>  <p>  In regard to the DMURS, this was jointly published by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2013 and was followed by a series of nationwide information seminars in early 2014 and 2015.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this Manual is to ensure that the welfare and needs of pedestrians are prioritised in the design of streets in urban areas, so that roadways for cars don&rsquo;t dominate our towns and cities. It also promotes short actively fronted movement systems to better facilitate and encourage pedestrian movement, and is fully consistent with our planning intentions to create more compact settlements.</p></reply>

This includes the achievement of energy efficiency, the implementation of planned maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs and pre-letting repairs.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are currently undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of my Department, on the least energy efficient social homes. Funding of some &euro;115.7 million has been provided from 2013 to the end of 2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000  local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020. </p>  <p>  The Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme is being implemented in a number of phases: Phase 1 commenced in 2013 and is focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties while Phase 2 of the Programme, which has been piloted in both Fingal and Westmeath County Councils, will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction. Funding may also be provided under Phase 2 to upgrade poorly performing windows and doors in specific circumstances.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the main focus of the available funding for the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme will be on the completion of the remaining Phase 1 works and formally rolling out Phase 2. My Department will, shortly, be asking local authorities including Longford County Council to submit details of their work proposals and related funding requirements for this programme in 2018. In relation to the project referred to by the Deputy, my Department will, of course, consider that project for funding once an application has been submitted to the Department. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, if a local authority identifies a tenanted dwelling  which requires a specific and urgent energy efficiency upgrade, especially in those dwellings which accommodate elderly people and people with disabilities, then a special case should be made to my Department to have these works funded.</p></reply>

The scheme supports heritage projects across the country and creates employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas, and is co-ordinated by each local authority.   My Department has allocated &euro;2m under the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2018, of which &euro;50,000 is the indicative amount for County Kildare. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  Local authorities have submitted applications to my Department and they will shortly be assessed by an expert panel. Successful applicants will be notified by their local authority shortly thereafter. My Department has allocated &euro;1,324,000 under the Structures at Risk Fund 2018. While there is no specific allocation for each local authority, I can confirm that applications have been received in respect of County Kildare. </p>  <p>  Receipt of applications for both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and Structures at Risk Fund are now closed, however on-going queries can be addressed to all respective local authorities who are implementing both schemes throughout 2018.</p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a state initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 built heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid to its protection and conservation. The NIAH building surveys provide the basis for my recommendations, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, to the planning authorities for the inclusion of particular structures in their Record of Protected Structures. The published surveys are a source of information on the selected structures for relevant planning authorities.  They are also a research and educational resource. </p>  <p>  Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), my Department manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. While the existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, it is also recognised that they are &lsquo;core assets&rsquo; which play a very important role in Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. </p>  <p>  My Department has entered into a Strategic Partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and is finalising a Tourism Interpretation Masterplan; &ldquo;Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland&rdquo;. This plan sets out projects that could be developed in the National Parks to enhance their tourism offering in a managed and sustainable way. </p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar T.D., recently launched the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan &ndash; Ireland 2040.  The Framework and Plan recognise the value and importance of our culture, language and heritage as an integral part of Irish life and have built in significant support for these areas into both the plan and framework.  Further details on my Department&rsquo;s investment programme will be provided in the Department&rsquo;s sectorial plan &ndash; Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage &ndash; which will be launched on 1 March 2018.</p></reply>

The Programme encourages and supports active participation in creative activity, particularly but not exclusively through the arts and culture based on the belief that nurturing the creative imagination is crucially important for individual well-being, social cohesion and economic success.  The Programme is delivered primarily through existing structures &ndash; the Arts Council, the 31 local authorities, the Film Board, and relevant Government Departments, including my own Department.</p><p>This Government recently launched <i>Project Ireland 2040;</i>a comprehensive national planning framework and associated 10-year National Development Plan.  <i>Project Ireland 2040 </i>explicitly recognises that our culture, language and heritage are an essential part of the sustainable development of the country.  </p><p>This acknowledgement of the centrality of culture and creativity to our national development is unprecedented in this type of statutory planning framework, as is the commitment to investment in excess of &euro;1 billion in our culture and heritage over the next 10 years.  Of this investment some &euro;725 million will be invested directly in our cultural infrastructure, in our creative industries and in enhancing cultural experience for our citizens.  </p><p>All of this represents real and substantial funding increases across the cultural areas of my Department, which will lead to greater employment in these areas.</p></reply>

Implementation of the Programme is underpinned by three essential operating principles - collaboration and communication, community empowerment and internationalisation.</p>  <p>  The programme is based on five pillars which are: enabling the creative potential of every child, enabling creativity in every community, investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure, establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production and unifying our global reputation. Implementation of the Programme, while under the aegis of my Department, will, where the opportunity arises, primarily be through, and in collaboration with existing agencies, local authorities, cultural institutions, State bodies and other cultural partners.  Pillars 2, 3 and 4 of the Programme are of particular relevance to the economic development of communities. </p>  <p>  My Department, together with its other partners, is now in the process of finalising plans to further the implementation of the Creative Ireland Programme for the coming years in respect of the five pillars of the programme, working collaboratively with colleagues across Government and in the sector.</p></reply>

As does Waterways Ireland.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland continues to work closely with boat owners using the canals, adjacent land owners, representative groups and committees.  Meetings are held with the key stakeholder interest groups, the Royal Canal Amenity Group, Inland Waterways Association of Ireland (IWAI) and the Heritage Boat Association (HBA).  </p>  <p>  In addition, Waterways Ireland works alongside the Friends of the Grand Canal and Royal Canal Clean-Up Group in Dublin and the newly established Grand Canal Dock Group, which, like many of the communities throughout the waterways, support the maintenance and operation of the canals. </p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland staff meet canal users on a daily basis and provide a wide range of services as well as managing boat use on the canals in accordance with the 1988 Canal Bye-laws.  In this regard, Waterways Ireland continues to concentrate on boats which consistently remain in breach of the Bye-laws.  Where a boat owner fails to respond to requests to comply, after notification by letters, telephone calls and formal notice, a programme of boat removal continues. </p>  <p>  In Grand Canal Dock, where boat owners have refused to move and are seeking to permanently reside on their vessels in breach of the Bye-laws, regulation of use of these prime location berths is being taken forward under the 1988 Canal Bye-laws to protect these public amenities.  A group of Heritage Boat Association vessels are using the newly secured and serviced moorings in Grand Canal Outer Dock over the winter of 2017/18, before moving to Athlone in September 2018 for the World Canal Conference, which is once again to be held in Ireland (last hosted here  in 2002).</p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.</p>  <p>  Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme, including relocation where feasible, for affected turf cutters. </p>  <p>  13,446 annual payments and 994 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of applications received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation. 737 annual payments and a delivery of turf have been made to applicants from raised bog natural heritage areas under the scheme. In addition, 1,824 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made, of which 42 relate to natural heritage areas.</p>  <p>  Relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs is a complex process. Notwithstanding this, progress in relocation has been achieved in a number of cases. In addition, my</p>  <p>  Department is moving forward in the relocation process for 8 relocation sites. </p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, published in December 2017, sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed, including exploring the options in terms of certain provisions of article 6 of the Habitats Directive. </p>  <p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>
