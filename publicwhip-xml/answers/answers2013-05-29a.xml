There were almost 102,400 recipients of disability allowance at the end of March.  However, the Government was able to reduce the net savings required in Budget 2013 to &euro;390 million, &euro;150 million less than originally indicated.  This enabled the Government to ensure, for the second year in a row, that there was no reduction in primary weekly rates of payment, including the rate of disability allowance.  In addition, there were no changes to the weekly fuel allowance which may be payable with disability allowance or to free travel, which DA recipients also receive.</p><p>  In relation to the forthcoming Budget, the Deputy will be aware that the Expenditure Report 2013 published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;440 million to be achieved in 2014 in the Department of Social Protection budget.  The Government have not made any decisions in relation to measures to be introduced in Budget 2014.  The Government will finalise its consideration of the Budget in the coming months having regard to all of its commitments, including the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain welfare rates.  The outcome of this process will be announced on Budget Day.</p></reply>

The additional placements on community employment, T&uacute;s and JobBridge have already been rolled-out and are in the process of being filled by the sponsoring organisations and implementing bodies. The Budget package introduced a new initiative with local authorities to provide 3,000 part-time work opportunities in 2013.  This is in line with the commitments set out in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> and <i>Pathways to Work</i>.</p><p>  The design of this initiative has been largely completed and local authorities have been engaged in a process of identifying the nature of work and range of opportunities that can be made available across their administrative and operational areas.  Local authorities have been asked to complete consultations with staff representative bodies and other key stakeholders to enable the scheme to commence on a staged basis over the coming months.  Currently, 13 local authorities have agreed to lead out the first wave of the initiative and selection of participants will commence by the Department of Social Protection in the coming weeks.  Following referral of interested customers by the Department, each local authority will conduct their own recruitment process, involving skill profiling, job matching and vetting by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before a person is assigned to a position.  My understanding is that the local authorities in this first wave have identified some 700 positions to be filled before the end of September.  The remaining placements are in the process of being identified with a view to having commenced recruitment by the end of 2013. </p></reply>

There are currently approximately 86,000 recipients of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013 and &euro;423 million in 2012.  Expenditure on the scheme up to end April 2013 is approximately &euro;127 million.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  As the Department currently funds almost 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are continually kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others such as low-income workers and students.</p><p>  Analysis of recent reports has shown that rents have increased in some urban areas, including Dublin, with rental asking rates falling in other cities and rural areas.  Revised rent limits were due to be in place from July of this year.  However, I am pleased to say the review is almost finalised, with new rent limits expected to be in place in early June.  The emphasis of the review is to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  All major urban population centres are being examined to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities.</p></reply>

The FIS payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he/she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.   I am happy to inform the Deputy that the processing of all FIS applications both new and renewal made to my Department are fully up to date. It should be noted that total FIS claim intake rose from 37,597 in 2007 to 51,214 in 2011 and at present there are just over 40,440 families who are benefiting from the scheme. Expenditure on FIS for 2012 was of &euro;224 million with estimated expenditure for 2013 to be of the order of &euro;229 million</p><p>  The FIS payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he/she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with, or is supported by  him or her. Furthermore, the average family income must be below an income threshold which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>  FIS income thresholds have been maintained at the same level since 2010. Prior to this FIS income thresholds had risen broadly in line with equivalent social welfare rates so as to maintain their value relative to unemployment payments. A reduction in income thresholds would have financial implications which would have to be considered in the context of the budget.  There are no plans to do so currently.</p><p>  More generally, I recognise that creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that we face. It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensure that work is worthwhile. To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience in order to address a number of specific issues. These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. In this regard the Group is currently examining the issue of working age supports, which includes consideration of in-work supports such as FIS.</p><p>  The availability of FIS is currently advertised and promoted by means of a number of appropriate and cost-effective methods. The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s website provides a description of the qualifying conditions and contact details along with examples of the families that can qualify. A visitor to the website can access comprehensive and easily understandable information about the payment and download an application form and information booklet.  From 16 January 2013, the date on which the new Departmental website was launched, to date, the FIS pages have received almost 40,000 page views. Further prominence will be given to FIS on the Department&rsquo;s website shortly as it is planned to advertise the scheme on the revolving banner on the Department&rsquo;s home page. Information is also available through the Citizen&rsquo;s Information Service and on their website.</p><p>  The Department recently undertook a series of road shows around the country designed to inform employers of Intreo, the new integrated one-stop shop service in the Department, and to let employers know about all the incentives that are available to encourage them to employ people from the live register. These events provided an opportunity for employers to learn about the wide range of support services provided by the Department, including FIS.  Information on FIS forms part of the Department&rsquo;s employer information pack which is available via the website and the Department&rsquo;s employment support service staff throughout the country are fully briefed on FIS.</p><p>  My Department is shortly to embark on a poster campaign in all the Department&rsquo;s local offices and the Department&rsquo;s information officers and employer liaison officers have recently been briefed on the qualifying criteria and supports that FIS provides for employees with families on low incomes.</p></reply>

These reforms will create a transitional arrangement specifically for former OFP recipients with children under 14 years of age who are awarded a JA payment. This arrangement will operate for a transitional period and give these individuals an exemption from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work. This transitional period is required as lone parents with young children have caring responsibilities which may have prevented them from being available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.</p><p>  This arrangement will enable lone parents to work part time, provided they satisfy the JA means test, and will therefore offer them the continued security of income support from my Department. Lone parents on JA under this arrangement will also be able to access the new afterschool child care scheme, which provides subsidised afterschool childcare if they secure employment or engage on a CE scheme.</p><p>  The aim of introducing these OFP reforms and creating this arrangement is to improve outcomes for lone parents. As a result of these measures lone parents will now be able to access the Department&rsquo;s activation supports and services. As part of this process, all lone parents on JA will be profiled, have a group engagement, and be encouraged to develop a personal development plan in conjunction with their case officer.  This personal development plan will identify suitable education, training, and employment programmes that will enable them to improve their skills set and increase their prospects of securing employment. </p><p>  The exemptions from the full JA conditionality will remain in place until the lone parent&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  At this point, should the customer continue to claim the JA payment, he or she will be subjected to the full JA conditionality.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-29a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900069#WRB00600"><p>Where a person states that they have found work, it is normal practice for a jobseeker claim to be closed.  However, in cases where the customer is taking up a short period of temporary work or training (up to 8 weeks), arrangements are now in place to simplify the process of returning to the live register at the end of this period.  In these cases, instead of closing the claim, payment is suspended temporarily for the duration of the work or training course.  When the person signs on again after the period of work or training, the claim can be reactivated without delay and payment restored.  Where a person accepts an offer of short term temporary work or training it is important to advise the local office in advance of the expected duration so that the process I describe is put in place.</p></reply>

Likewise, the disability allowance (DA) represents an important income support to people who are unfit for work.</p><p>  DCA is now in payment in respect of over 26,500 children, an increase of over 3,500 since the Department took over responsibility for the scheme from the HSE in April 2009.  Spending on the scheme and the respite care grant, which is automatically paid to all recipients, has increased from &euro;138 million to &euro;145 million between 2010 and 2012.  In 2012, DA was in payment in respect of 102,000 customers at a cost of &euro;1.09 billion.</p><p>  The second report of the Advisory group on Tax and Social Welfare on the issue of the Budget 2012 proposals regarding DA and DCA was published on 10 April 2013.  At the same time, the report of the Review Group on the operation of the DCA scheme was also published.  These reports make a number of policy recommendations, which make a valuable contribution to the policy debate in relation to young people with disabilities.  My colleagues in Government and I will consider these  findings, taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation as well as other work underway.</p><p>  The administrative recommendations made in the report of the Review Group on the operation of the DCA scheme will result in an improvement in the level of service provided to our customers and will assist in ensuring that those people who meet the qualifying conditions for the payment receive it in a timely manner. Some of these recommendations are already implemented and it is my intention that the remaining recommendations will be implemented quickly, to this end an implementation group, representing those groups and Departments who contributed to the review, is in the process of being established.</p></reply>

The Recommendation is that Member States should</font><font color="#2F2F2F"> ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  While it is recommended that the guarantee should be implemented as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will be more gradual in the Member States experiencing the most severe budgetary difficulties and higher rates of youth unemployment.  The Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee.  This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.  In this context, the Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland.  We have sought funding from the European Commission for a the proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area of north Dublin, and numerous organisations (e.g. IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland) have agreed to participate in this pilot.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided. </font> Other relevant provision is made through the training and education programmes delivered through F&Aacute;S and the further education sector.<font color="#2F2F2F">  The size and the timescale for any additional provision that is both desirable and feasible, over and above that outlined above, will be established over the coming months.</font></p></reply>

Public servants (including civil servants) who are due to retire aged 65 in January 2014 will be able to draw their occupational public service pension at age 65.  However, for those public servants (including civil servants) who are fully insured, their public service pensions (and contributions) are, like many occupational pension schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension (transition or contributory).  Where this does not happen, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme to bridge the gap.</p><p>  In this instance, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is, therefore, necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension.  This situation is not new and already applies to public sector workers who have a retirement age below 65.  For other workers, the main social welfare payments available to those who leave employment before pension age are jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance.  Persons aged between 65 and 66 years who qualify for a jobseeker's payment are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).</p><p><b></b>It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  Increasing longevity and significant improvements in health status mean that people can work longer to support themselves in retirement.  Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund and the difficult fiscal situation.</p></reply>

It provides some services directly to the public.  It directly funds and supports an extensive range of services through its delivery partners, including the 42 Citizens Information Centres, CIS, and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which is made up of a network of 53 companies, including 51 local companies, MABS National Development and National Traveller MABS.  Some 277 money advice staff are employed across the MABS network.  The Citizens Information Board is allocated an annual budget from which it funds all of its services.  It is responsible for ensuring appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.  Responsibility for MABS transferred to the CIB in July 2009.  Funding for MABS now forms part of the overall CIB allocation.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-29a.66.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900070#WRC01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 29 and 52 together.</p><p>  The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 611,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children.  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment.  Since becoming Minister for Social Protection, I have strongly defended the universality of child benefit because the State must value every child and support families.  The fact that every family receives child benefit, regardless of their employment status, also ensures there is not a disincentive to work.  It is envisaged that any proposed changes to the child benefit payment would be considered in the context of the annual budget and estimates process and announced on Budget day.</p><p>  In addition to child benefit, the social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment.  Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports raises complex issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children.  In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.</p><p>  This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most.  Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate on the matter.  In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, such as child care, I expect the Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation. </p><p>  Government policy on the provision of child care services, such as those supported by the Early Childhood Care and Education scheme, is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Any proposal to fund additional child care services from reductions in the child benefit scheme would require a Government decision within an overall budgetary context on which no indications can be given at the present time.  It should also be noted that as the Government meets and acts collectively, Ministers regularly consult with their colleagues in Government on policy proposals and any implications that such proposals might have.</p></reply>

The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Details of cases in payment over 18 months are notified on a quarterly basis to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG). I attach a tabular statement outlining details of the numbers of customers in receipt of the supplement for one to five years.</p><p>The Government has approved, in principle, the transfer of responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from this Department to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Officials in the Department are working closely with those in DECLG to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  DECLG has advised that piloting of HAP is subject to the necessary legislative requirements being in place.</p><p>Under the proposed arrangements for HAP, landlords will receive the rent for the property directly from the housing authority. Unlike the rent supplement scheme, where the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. The official dealing with the request will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the particular case and the tenant&rsquo;s preference will be accommodated where possible.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p><b>Rent Supplement by Claim Duration, End March 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Claim Duration (Years)</th><th><div>Recipients</div></th></tr><tr><td> Up to 1</td><td><div>31,729</div></td></tr><tr><td> 1 to 2</td><td><div>21,724</div></td></tr><tr><td> 2 to 3</td><td><div>13,609</div></td></tr><tr><td> 3 to 4</td><td><div>9,032</div></td></tr><tr><td> 4 to 5</td><td><div>4,878</div></td></tr><tr><td>5+</td><td><div>5,403</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>86,375</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Note:</b></p><p>(1)   Claims with duration of precisely 1 year are recorded under the 1-2 years heading, claims with duration of precisely 2 years are recorded under the 2-3 years heading and so on.</p><p>(2)   This represents unbroken continuous claims only.</p></reply>

I understand that but I also have to have regard to the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the recommendations of the Gender Recognition Advisory Group (GRAG) relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals.  The Department has been taking advice on this matter including talking to the various stakeholders involved.  I feel that the Committee can make a very positive contribution to the preparation of the legislation and I believe that this approach should greatly assist the drafting of the legislation and its progress through the Oireachtas. When the Oireachtas Committee has discussed the provisional draft Heads of Bill, I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation.</p></reply>

It was introduced in 1999 to replace 'Smallholders Unemployment Assistance' for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  In Budget 2013 two measures were announced, which were implemented in April 2013, which bring the farm assist scheme into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme's treatment of self-employed persons by:</p><p>  a. Increasing the amount of means from self-employment, which is assessed against the claimant from 85% to 100%; and</p><p>  b. Discontinuing the means testing disregards for child dependents of claimants.</p><p>  Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues, due for example to bad weather, can ask his/her local social welfare/Intreo office to review the level of means applying to his/her claim.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is not based on accounts from a particular year but is designed to reflect the actual net income and looks at gross income, less any expenses necessarily incurred, from farming. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  I recently met with a delegation from the Irish Farmers Association on 15th May 2013 to discuss a range of issues, including difficulties arising as a result of fodder shortages and the operation of the farm assist scheme generally.</p></reply>

The Table below provides details of processing times for each of the Department&rsquo;s schemes in March 2013.  All claims are registered promptly, in some schemes this is done through the scanning of claim documents onto the system while in other schemes this involves an officer inputting data.  The time taken to perform means tests and/or medical examinations where these are required is not measured separately, while a determination on habitual residence where required is an integral part of the decision making process.</p><p>Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  As can be seen from the data in the table below, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  Work on clearing backlogs in some scheme areas, such as carers allowance and invalidity pension has temporarily distorted the time taken to clear claims due to the high level of reviews and appeals following backlog clearances, but the progress made will be reflected in processing times in the coming months.  Both schemes are up to date with the processing of new applications, as is family income supplement for both new and renewal applications.</p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.</p><p>The new Intreo service is currently being rolled-out and implemented on a phased basis.  This new service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalized service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo Centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into the Department.  The benefits of the integrated decisions process are already visible in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.</p><p><b>  Table: Claim processing times - March 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Average weeks to award</th></tr><tr><td>State Pension (contributory)</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (transition)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>State pension (non-contributory) </td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)'s Pension (contributory)  </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)'s Pension (non-con) pension &amp;amp; one parent family payment (widow)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family </td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension </td><td>60 (claims received in the last 6 months are decided within 8 weeks.

The Scheme has made very significant progress.  As at 24th May 2013, 17,609 internships have commenced to-date.  There are currently 6,104 jobseekers undertaking internship opportunities.  In addition, there are 2,218 internship opportunities available across a wide number of occupational sectors and geographic areas being hosted on the website.  All these opportunities are advertised on the JobBridge website www.jobbridge.ie </p><p>  The Department takes breaches of the Scheme very seriously and 17 companies have been disqualified from participating in JobBridge due to breaches of the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  This action was taken by the Department following detailed investigations.  The following were the key breaches of the Scheme and reasons for disqualification: </p><p>- Standard Agreement not completed</p><p>- Appropriate Mentoring/Development not being provided</p><p>- Not adhering to Compliance Requirements</p><p>- Displacement Issues</p><p>- Failure to provide reference to intern</p><p> However, it is important to highlight that the overwhelming majority of companies are abiding by the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  In fact, over 7,500 host organisations have commenced interns and only 17 companies have been disqualified due to breaches of the Scheme.  The Department have strong and robust monitoring controls in place and over 2,000 monitoring visits have been conducted to-date.  Encouragingly, 98% of these visits were of a satisfactory nature.  Remedial action is taken in cases of non-compliance up to and including disqualification from participating in the Scheme.</p><p>  It is worth highlighting that unemployed people at all skill levels have an equal right to an activation measure and there are internship opportunities available at all levels and in all sectors to address this.  In the case of all internships, the Standard Agreement must be completed by both the Intern and the Host Organisation and must specify the learning outcomes that the intern will attain.  A recent independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns progress to paid employment after completing their internship. This outcome is among the best in Europe, where progression rates for similar internship schemes average just 34%.  The evaluation report also found that:</p><p>- 89% of interns stated that JobBridge had given them new skills</p><p>- Interns found that they also benefited from: an increase in their self-confidence; the opportunity to gain quality work experience; the opportunity to establish a network of contacts.</p><p>  The Indecon evaluation clearly demonstrates that JobBridge is delivering for thousands of jobseekers by providing them with valuable opportunities to gain relevant work experience, knowledge and skills in a workplace environment. </p></reply>

These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, reviewing and  improving business processes and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  It is also worth noting that, despite the increase in the volume of appeals being received, the number of appeals on hand has reduced from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 17,060 at 24 May 2013.  Processing times for all appeal types reduced by 10.3 weeks overall in 2012  when compared to 2011, with the time taken to finalise an appeal requiring an oral hearing down by 13 weeks  and the time for an appeal decided by way of a summary decision up by 2.7 weeks.</p><p>By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p><p><b>Appeals pending and current average processing times by scheme type</b></p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th></th><th></th><th><div>Current

The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement (MIS) scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.

Statistics are not available on the number of applications for MIS for this period.</p><p>Following the Department's review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the MIS scheme and the review of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group the eligibility criteria for MIS was changed to ensure that the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) operated by the lenders functions alongside other State supports, including MIS.  To ensure that those who are in mortgage difficulty engage with their lender under the MARP and avail of its forbearance arrangements, from June 2012 the mortgage interest supplement is not payable until applicants have agreed with their lender and complied with an alternative payment arrangement for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-29a.114.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900072#WRE02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 140 and 141 together. </p><p>  In the first instance, the Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.  The Government is implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market.  There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:- </p><p>- The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;</p><p>- The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;</p><p>- The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education.  Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year;</p><p>- Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012.  This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses;</p><p>- This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.  Over 1,250 of these places are assigned specifically for under 25s;</p><p>- The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700;</p><p>- Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register;</p><p>- In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment.  About a quarter of these places are expected to be taken up by unemployed young people. </p><p>  With regard to targets, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. In this context, the Department of Finance anticipates that the overall unemployment rate will fall from 14.7% in 2012 to 12.3% in 2016.  This could be expected to see youth unemployment fall from over 30% in 2012 to 24% or less in 2016. </p><p>  In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative's targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  Specifically, these targets are that:</p><p>  (i) at least 75,000 of long-term unemployed people will move into employment by 2015 (starting 2012). </p><p>  (ii) Increase the exit rate of people on the  live register  for two years or more by 50%  (to 40%)  by the end of 2015 </p><p>  (iii) Reduce the persistence rate (the rate at which short term unemployed people become long term unemployed)  to 25% by the end of 2015. </p><p> As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people. </p><p>  A new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.</p><p>  Following from the formal adoption of the EU Recommendation on Implementing a Youth Guarantee, the Government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee.  This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012 was at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  </p><p>  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.  It is to be hoped that any measures taken by government in relation to the implementation of the youth guarantee will see youth unemployment fall even further than is already anticipated on the basis of existing policies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-29a.117.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900072#WRE02200"><p>Consistent poverty which is defined as a combination of at-risk-of-poverty (where household income is below the 60% equivalised national median income threshold) and basic deprivation (an enforced lack of 2 or more items of an 11 item list of basic goods and services) is the official Irish measure used to quantify the proportion of the population living in poverty.  As measured by the CSO in its annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), the consistent poverty rate in 2011 for children (0-17 years) was 9.3 per cent, compared with 6.8 per cent for the adult population (18-64 years).  In relative terms, children are therefore over one and half times more likely to be in consistent poverty than adults. </p><p>  Government policy in relation to both income supports, improving employment prospects for parents and improved delivery of public service are important factors in improving child poverty outcomes.  For instance, the poverty reduction effect of social transfers demonstrates that the social protection system is relatively effective at reducing the number of children in poverty.  From 2004 to 2010, the poverty reduction effect of social transfers for children&rsquo;s at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 43 per cent to 62 per cent.  This reflects the impact of improved transfers and parental employment during the earlier part of this period. </p><p>  Reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty is a fundamental aspiration of Irish society.  In this context, the national social target for poverty reduction provides a key reference point for Government policies and offers a tangible benchmark against which to measure social and economic progress.  Following a review of the target which was published in 2012, the Government agreed to set a new sub-target for the reduction of child poverty following consultation with relevant stakeholders.  This is in recognition of the life-long consequences of child poverty and the damaging effects of inter-generational poverty.  </p><p>  A sub-target for child poverty reduction will recognise that a multi-dimensional approach is needed to meet existing commitments and to take into account the importance of income supports, services and parental access to employment.  For instance, children in jobless households are far more likely to experience consistent poverty than children generally.  The overriding objective for the Government is to increase employment, promote activation, skills training and education.  This will ultimately help to build real and sustainable economic growth and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society. </p><p>  The Department is working closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to these issues.  As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague Minister Frances Fitzgerald T.D. is overseeing the new Children and Young People's Policy Framework through which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.  She is also overseeing on-going work on implementing a new area-based approach to child poverty, building on evidence and experiences in prevention and early intervention programmes. </p></reply>

In the two years in question, amounts of &euro;645m and &euro;669m in control savings were recorded as achieved by year end.  The savings target for 2013 is &euro;710 million which is an increase of &euro;40m on the savings achieved in 2012.</p><p>Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  Control savings refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work the social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.  Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error.  Control savings do not include any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.  The Department does not classify control savings as a result of fraudulent activity.</p><p>The table below gives a breakdown of the control savings recorded for Q1 2011, 2012 and 2013.  Savings on a monthly or quarterly basis can vary as some control activity is recorded on an on-going basis while other project activity is only recorded when the project is completed and these projects can vary in scope and timeframe from year to year.</p><p><table><tr><th>Q1 Figures</th><th>Savings recorded &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Q1 2011</td><td>136.18</td></tr><tr><td>Q1 2012</td><td>202.22</td></tr><tr><td>Q1 2013</td><td>132.47</td></tr></table></p><p>Actual money recovered arises where the Department raises overpayments in individual cases.  Overpayments raised by the Department are categorised as &lsquo;fraud&rsquo;, &lsquo;non-fraud&rsquo; or &lsquo;estate&rsquo; cases.  Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income and family status.  Non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer or third party error, with some due to Departmental error.  Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers come to light after their deaths.</p><p>In 2011 a total of &euro;92.4m was raised in overpayments and of this amount, &euro;34.9m was recorded as attributable to fraud or suspected fraud.  The Department is not in a position to publicly report on overpayments recorded in 2012 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></reply>

It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States, without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member States.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland. </p><p>  Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to all aspects of claims are made by statutorily appointed Deciding Officers (DOs) and decisions in relation to Supplementary Welfare Allowance are made by Designated Persons (DPs).  Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on the application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of the case.  Before a decision can be made regarding a person's habitual residence, it must first be established whether the person has a legal right to reside in the State.  For example, nationals from outside the EU who have been granted special permission to remain in Ireland will need to provide an official letter from the Department of Justice and Equality to confirm their status and /or a copy of their residency permit (Garda National Immigration Bureau card).</p><p>  The right to reside test is a<b></b>question of law, which seeks to ascertain whether the claimant has a lawful right to reside in Ireland.  Once the legal right to reside is satisfied the five criteria used to determine whether a person satisfies the HRC includes a) the length and continuity of living in Ireland, b) length and reasons for any absence, c) nature and pattern of the person's employment, d) person's main centre of interest and e) future intentions of the person applying for the social welfare scheme. </p><p>Examples of information required include:</p><p> - identification documents such as a passport,</p><p> - bank statements from outside and within Ireland, as applicable, </p><p> - utility bills such as electricity, gas, telephone,</p><p> - rent/ mortgage agreements or  receipts for local authority charges,</p><p> - travel documents or evidence to move or store personal possessions.</p><p>  The HRC is a question of fact, which seeks to ascertain whether the claimant has established his/ her 'centre of interest' in Ireland by examining family connections, length of stay, employment history etc.  HRC guidelines are available on the DSP website which outline in detail the legislative basis for making decisions and also provide detailed guidance for customers. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision internally within DSP and/or appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. </p><p>  The person concerned was previously in receipt of rent supplement from 24th August 2009 to 26th January 2013 when payment ceased as she was no longer occupying rented accommodation.

Recent changes to State pension supports the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  Aligning the rate of pension with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement.  It also ensures greater sustainability of the State pensions system which is essential in the light of demographic changes.  This is clear from the figures which indicate the current ratio of workers to pensioners will change from 6:1 at present to 1:2 by 2060.</p><p>   The homemaker scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This can be beneficial for women who have taken time out of the workforce for caring purposes.  The homemaker disregard will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions must also be satisfied. </p><p>  Female employment rates have increased significantly since 1994, from c. 40% in 1994 to 60% in 2008.  It has fallen back since to 55% but many of the unemployed will be getting credits.  Ultimately, while difficult to quantify, this will ensure that additional women will qualify for a pension in their own right.  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in September 2012 confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  The Review shows that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the redistributive nature of the Fund. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that a review was undertaken in the Department in order to establish the prior position of those reaching State pension age and the review showed that only 0.05% of people come directly from homemaking on to State pension transition.  It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a full rate pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-29a.142.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900074#WRG00500"><p> There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The &ldquo;top up&rdquo; payments referred to fall into two specific categories.  Where a person has an additional income above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance they are, in certain circumstances, allowed to top up their rent as they will still have sufficient income to meet their basic needs after paying their rent.</p><p>  The second type of top-up payment can occur where the application to the Department declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord.  There has been no evidence presented to the Department showing widespread or systemic &lsquo;false declarations&rsquo; of rent supplement through the use of illegal top-ups.  The tenant, landlord or landlord&rsquo;s agent must complete the rent supplement application form, which includes the amount of rent, and declare that the information provided is correct and accurate.  The Department&rsquo;s form clearly states that making a false statement or withholding information may lead to prosecution.  I currently have no plans to run a public information campaign to highlight to landlords that it is illegal to demand an undeclared top-up payment but I have asked the Department to keep the matter under review.</p><p>  The Department, in June 2012, introduced powers of inquiry (Section 14 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012) for staff to formally request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy.  This measure improves both the governance and oversight arrangements in place.  Any instance of false declarations should be reported to the relevant Department representatives who have specific legislative powers to deal with such offences.</p></reply>

In a number of instances nationally, the Department of Social Protection, through the Community Services Programme (CSP), has been able to support the provision of services by community companies.  Contracts under the CSP are provided in the form of wage subsidy for the employment of a manager and a number of full-time equivalent positions.  The nature and type of services provided by contractors vary across a broad range of activities.  To be eligible, the service must be provided by a non-profit sharing company or co-operative; the service must be capable of being traded and revenue generating and must meet locally identified service gaps or where there is a deficit in demand that cannot be met by the public or private sectors.  The level of non-public resources required to be generated by contractors relate to the nature of the service provision, the local opportunities to trade and a range of other social and commercial factors.  Pobal has been engaged by the Department to provide contract management, financial control and day-to-day operational services.  The funding available to the programme in 2013 is just over &euro;46m with 420 contracts in place at the end of May 2013 supporting 2,084 full-time positions.

The European Court of Human Rights issues judgments and decisions relating to the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Court and Convention operate within the framework of the Council of Europe rather than the European Union, but it is hoped that the EU will shortly accede to the Convention.

I understand that this decision was taken due to the very significant reduction in funds available to the IFI. </p><p>  I would like to reiterate my belief that the IFI continues to have an important role to play and I agree with the focus of its new strategy which is targeted at those communities that have not previously, or only partially engaged in peace building and reconciliation activities.  I have discussed that IFI role with the Northern Ireland Executive, the British Government as well as raising it with our friends in the US Congress and Capitol Hill during my visit to Washington D.C. last March.  In a similar way, the Government has worked with EU partners to secure further funding under the EU Peace Programme.  The Government supports the inclusion of cross border and cross community youth training as part of that programme.  </p><p>  It is regrettable that a programme such as this which has had such a positive impact on the lives of those trainees who participated in it has to come to an end.  I understand that the Wider Horizons Programme was in receipt of approximately &pound;4 million sterling per annum and the IFI no longer has the financial resources to maintain this support.  However this is not a government programme and to respect the independence of the IFI, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to comment or to intervene further on the matter. </p><p> </p></reply>

These figures are published annually in the National Income and Expenditure accounts, with the latest available final figures to 2011. The re-domiciled public limited companies (PLCs) are resident in Ireland and must be incorporated into our National statistics. In accordance with the European and International Statistical Standards, the CSO is not required to produce a separate series which excludes the impact of these entities on GNI.  However,  to  assist analysis of the macroeconomic accounts for Ireland, the ESRI recently published an estimate of the retained profits relating to these re-domiciled PLCs. From this, it can be estimated that by 2011 the impact represented about 4.5% of GNI.  Taking account of this analysis and the significance of the GNI key in the calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s overall contribution, indicative estimates for the 2009-2011 period would suggest that the impact of these redomiciled PLCs upon our budget contributions was to increase the amount paid in by Ireland. The following table sets out an estimate for the years 2009 &ndash; 2011 of what the annual impact might have been, if the effect arising from the redomiciled PLCs was excluded.</p><p><b>Estimated Annual Impact from Adjusted GNI</b></p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th></tr><tr><td>Estimated additional EU Budget contribution  was of the order of &amp;#8230; </td><td><div>&euro;15m</div></td><td><div>&euro;40m</div></td><td><div> &euro;45m</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the use of GNI as a contribution key favours Ireland, as unlike other countries this is significantly lower than our GDP. It accounts for about two thirds of our EU Budget contribution. It should be noted that in overall terms, under the current MFF 2007-2013, Ireland remains a net beneficiary from the EU Budget.</p></reply>

This decision was taken on the basis that the vast majority of taxpayers conduct business with Revenue via its online service, or via their employer, if they pay income tax under PAYE.  These services facilitate direct access to payment information and therefore customers have no need for a paper receipt.  The change has resulted in significant cost savings in terms of postage, stationery and staff resources.</p><p>  This arrangement now applies to Local Property Tax (LPT).  Customers who file online receive an online acknowledgement and have ongoing access to their return and payment details.  I am also advised that, where customers opt to pay LPT using one of the Revenue appointed third party payment service providers, receipts will issue for each payment made.  The appointed payment service providers are An Post Taxpay, Payzone and Omnivend.  Similarly, customers who file online over the telephone via the LPT helpline receive a paper acknowledgement of their payment from Revenue within two weeks.  Customers who file and pay using the paper LPT return do not receive a paper receipt. They will have evidence of LPT payments through their own financial institution records.  However, in circumstances where a payment fails for whatever reason, Revenue will make direct contact with the customer.</p></reply>

These annual Tax Strategy Group (TSG) papers are then published on the Department of Finance website when the Budget and Finance Bill process has concluded.  The paper in question is a Tax Strategy Paper from 1998 which is available on the  Department's website and can be reached at the following link: <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>  This report followed work undertaken by the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and what is now the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office were also consulted.  The issues outlined in the paper were subsequently addressed by a package of measures including amendments to Company Law provisions and the introduction of taxation provisions in Finance Act 1999.  </p><p>  The focus was on companies, engaged in fraud, money laundering, drug-trafficking and other illegal activities, which had no contact or association with the State following their registration.  As these companies were managed and controlled outside the State, they were not resident in Ireland for tax purposes under our long-standing management and control rule. The measures were designed to target as far as possible those companies which have no economic connection with Ireland and to minimise any adverse effects on legitimate business.  The Company Law measures are contained at sections 42-51 of the Companies Amendment)(No. 2) Act, 1999, which was enacted on 15 December, 1999. </p><p>  First, as a precondition of incorporation, every application for registration is required to demonstrate that the proposed company intends to carry on an activity in the State.  Secondly the 1999 Act required that every company registered in the State was required to maintain an Irish resident director or bond to the value of &euro;25,394.76. The Irish resident director requirement was subsequently changed to a requirement for a director resident in the European Economic Area. Additionally the number of directorships which could be held by one person was limited to 25 (subject to certain exemptions). Finally the Act contained enhanced strike-off provisions and enhanced notification to the CRO where directors have resigned.</p><p>  The taxation measures are contained in 23A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which was introduced by section 82 of Finance Act 1999 in order to supplement the management and control rule, which is the primary determinant of company tax residence, by providing that certain companies incorporated in the State are to be regarded as being resident in the State for tax purposes. </p><p>  Consistent with the purpose of the provisions - to address companies that were not managed and controlled in the State and had no real connection with the State apart from having been incorporated here - the 1999 additions to the residence rules provided that only Irish-incorporated companies with no other connection with the State were to be regarded as resident in the State by virtue of their incorporation here.</p><p>  A company incorporated in the State is not regarded as tax-resident here where -</p><p>- either the company or a related company is carrying on a trade in the State and either -</p><p>- the company is ultimately controlled in a tax treaty country or in an EU Member State or </p><p>- the company or a related company is quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the EU or in a tax treaty country, or </p><p>- the company is treated under a tax treaty as not resident in the State.</p></reply>

Two companies are members of a group of companies if one company is a 75% subsidiary of the other or both are 75% subsidiaries of a third company, where the third company is resident in the State or a treaty partner country or is quoted on a recognised stock exchange. A company is a 75% subsidiary of another company where not less than 75% of its ordinary share capital is owned directly or indirectly by that other group company.</p><p>  Under the existing group relief provisions, only current year trading losses may be surrendered by one group company to another group company and any losses surrendered must be used by the claimant company in the same or corresponding accounting period. The relief does not apply in respect of trading losses brought forward by the surrendering company from previous accounting periods. Also, any losses surrendered to a claimant group company cannot be carried forward by that company to future accounting periods.</p><p>  Based on preliminary data derived from corporation returns for the year 2011, the total amount of trading losses for which group relief was claimed in these returns was &euro;2,443 million and the estimated tax cost in respect of these claims was &euro;305 million. This cost does not take account of any behavioural response by companies to ensure continued utilisation of the losses concerned were group relief to be removed.</p><p>  Group relief is a common feature of corporate tax systems and similar relief in one form or another is available in many other countries, although the terms and conditions will vary from country to country. The availability of group relief is an important facility for Irish and multinational enterprises which conduct their business operations within a group of companies.  Imposing a limit on such relief would put these enterprises at a disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis enterprises that operate through branch structures rather than subsidiaries and, in the absence of other countries applying such a limit, could be detrimental to our international competitiveness. </p><p>  The transfer of losses within a group, by claiming group relief as provided for in the legislation in respect of losses that have been incurred by the group, could not be said to constitute aggressive tax planning and I would not see this as an activity to be limited in the context of initiatives at European level to counter aggressive tax planning.  However, I would point out that the Taxes Consolidation Act does contain restrictions to counter the transfer of losses from one company to another for tax avoidance purposes, often referred to as &ldquo;loss buying&rdquo;.  For example, Section 400 of the TCA provides that, where a loss-making trade is transferred from one company to another company in a group situation, the transferred trade is treated as a separate trade distinct from any other trading activities carried on by the successor. Any unused losses forward of the transferred trade are only allowable against profits attributable to that separate trade. This ensures that trading losses are ring-fenced to that trade and may not be offset against other trading income of the successor.</p><p>  In addition, Section 401 of TCA provides that where, within a period of 3 years, there is both a change of ownership of a company and a major change in the nature or conduct of the trade carried on by the company (e.g. major change in products, services, customers or markets), trading losses incurred by the company before the change of ownership are not allowable against trading income of the company after the change of ownership. The effect of these provisions to counter &ldquo;loss buying&rdquo; is to restrict the scope for utilising losses for tax planning purposes by combining loss-making and profitable business activities. These provisions are kept under review and, if any loopholes or weaknesses that pose a tax risk are identified, I will not hesitate to introduce appropriate legislative amendments.</p><p>  I should add, finally, that the Revenue Commissioners monitor and assess claims for group relief as part of their ongoing risk management and audit programme. Revenue has a range of resources at its disposal, both legislative and administrative, to counter tax avoidance and it will not hesitate to challenge claims for relief in respect of losses that are contrived and not genuine commercial losses incurred by an enterprise.</p></reply>

The amount of corporation tax paid in 2012 by the top 10 companies managed in Revenue&rsquo;s Large Cases Division was &euro;1.42 billion.</p></reply>

The reason for this is that such dividends are paid out of profits of the paying company which have already been subject to corporation tax and to apply a corporation tax charge on the company receiving the dividends would, in effect, amount to double taxation.  If an Irish resident company were to be made chargeable to corporation tax on dividends it received from other companies resident in the State, it would be necessary to provide a credit for corporation tax paid by the paying company on profits out of which the dividends are paid. As such a credit would offset the corporation tax payable on dividends received, there would be no net gain to the Exchequer from the removal of this exemption.</p></reply>

The exemption was introduced in 2004, and is contained in S626B TCA 1997. The purpose of its introduction was to encourage the establishment of regional headquarters and holding companies in Ireland. Most other EU Member States have similar provisions and the EU Commission approved the measure from a State aid perspective.  Disposals coming within the scope of the relief are ignored for tax purposes, while losses on disposals are not available for set-off.

The use of enforcement equipment such as mobile X<b>-</b>  ray scanners and other detection technologies is just one element of a multifaceted strategy employed by Revenue to tackle smuggling. This strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of smuggling activity and developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis. It necessitates ongoing review of operational policies and optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and inland to intercept contraband product.</p><p>  Revenue continually monitors ongoing developments in the market place in available X<b>-</b> ray and other technologies.  Revenue also continuously review their requirements and capability together with their selection and deployment of detection equipment. Revenue has made use of the European Union's Hercule II programme to part-fund the acquisition of detection equipment and will apply for further funding, where appropriate, in the future. The actual technology selected and the operational deployment of that technology are matters for the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  Revenue currently has three mobile X<b>-</b>ray systems.  Two of these are mobile X<b>-</b>ray container scanning systems that are based at Dublin Port and Rosslare Ferry Port respectively. Both these scanners are available for deployment at other ports,<font color="#FF0000"> </font> and at other locations such as warehouses, as required, and Revenue utilises them, on a risk assessment basis, at various locations throughout the country.  Revenue's other mobile X-ray system is a scan van, which is available for deployment and is used at airports, ports and warehouses. Revenue also uses smaller static baggage/parcel scanners at all major ports, airports and postal depots and are currently in the process of replacing units in Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport and Rosslare Ferry Port.</p><p>  Revenue, I understand, is generally satisfied with their current scanning capability and consider that the container ports are adequately serviced by their scanners.  Revenue has no plans at present to acquire any additional scanners.  In relation to the hours of operation of the existing X-ray scanners, I am advised that Revenue staff are rostered to be available to operate these scanning systems during port operational hours, which do not normally extend to a 24-hour basis.</p></reply>

All contracts under the Schools Broadband Access Programme were re-tendered last year under a public procurement competition. As a result of this the number of service providers has been expanded from 6 to 13 with the aim of ensuring that where available satisfactory solutions would be awarded to schools. The Department is aware of the difficulty that some schools, such as Culmullen National School have with their broadband service. Through the public procurement process the Department has sought as far as possible to reduce the reliance on satellite services and the number of schools awarded a satellite connection has fallen from approximately 1,800 in 2005 to approximately 200 at present. Satellite connections and some other slower connections were only awarded where no other solution was proposed and contracts for these connections were only awarded for one year. These schools will be re-tendered in a mini-competition this August to see if better solutions are available to be awarded. In addition to this the Department continually liaises with service providers to try and ensure that where possible improved connections will be made available.</p></reply>

Class A rate PRSI payment brings with it an entitlement to a State pension payable by the Department of Social Protection. The State pension becomes payable at age 65. As some public servants (particularly teachers) retire significantly earlier than age 65, their occupational pension may, on application and subject to certain criteria, be augmented by the payment of a supplementary pension by the occupational pension provider. The purpose in paying a supplementary pension is to ensure that such public servants who paid Class A rate PRSI are not disadvantaged in the period between their retirement and their receipt of the State pension. One of the conditions attaching to the award of a supplementary pension is that its payment should cease or be reduced, as appropriate, where the pensioner becomes entitled to a state pension. Cessation of the supplementary pension occurs where the rate of State pension payable is greater than the rate of the supplementary pension which was in payment.</p><p>  The person to whom the Deputy refers applied for and was awarded a supplementary pension following retirement from teaching. It has been established that the person to whom the Deputy refers is currently receiving a State pension. As a result of this, payment of supplementary pension from my Department has been discontinued. Payment of the occupational pension continues in the normal way. While my Department must cease payment of the supplementary pension in accordance with the terms of the statutory pension scheme, the issues raised by the person to whom the Deputy refers will be addressed in a sensitive manner.</p></reply>

All courses approved for funding are selected by an independent panel with industry and educational expertise, having regard to published selection criteria and following a competitive tendering process. A call for proposals for courses to be run under Springboard 2013 was issued by the Higher Education Authority in February 2013 with a deadline for receipt of proposals of 9 April. The call documentation is available on the Higher Education Authority website (www.hea.ie/en/node/1502). Details of the courses selected for funding by the independent panel will be available in the coming weeks.  </p><p>  Both public and private providers were also eligible to apply for funding from the Momentum fund, subject to a tender process. There were two stages in this process: (i) pre-qualification and (ii) project proposals assessment. Notification of the pre-qualification for the current round of funds was published on the e-tenders website last summer.  Pre-qualified providers had the opportunity to submit proposals which were considered in line with the tender specification.  No subsequent notification has been published. </p></reply>

My Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.  Some children may be fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. In respect of children who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided. </p><p>  The extent of supports required for any child in a particular class setting or school will depend on their disability categorisation and the extent of care needs that they may have.  Additional costs relating to school buildings, transport, the July Programme, the National Educational Psychological Service (Neps) the Special Education Support Service (SESS) and assistive technology support may also arise depending on individual needs.  Given the different supports provided in special and mainstream schools, depending on the disability categorisations of the pupils attending those schools, the care or attendant additional needs required, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the cost differentials between a child attending one school versus another.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education can assist parents to identify school placements which can then be resourced to support children with special educational needs.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie. </p></reply>

Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may therefore be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. There is not presently a distinct disability category of Down syndrome for resource allocation purposes. As such, it is not possible to advise of the number of children with Down syndrome who will be attending school for the 2013/14 school year. </p></reply>

To ensure that this is achieved, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The Five Year school building programme that I announced in March 2012 is focused on meeting those demographic needs. The 5 Year Construction Plan, together with my announcement last December of the 50 school projects which are scheduled for construction in the current year as part of a &euro;2 billion capital investment programme, outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Plan (2012-2016). </p><p>  It is not possible to progress all projects within the Department's building programme concurrently due to competing demands on the Department's capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of essential additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements.  I wish to advise the Deputy that where an immediate enrolment need in an area has been identified e.g. the appointment of an additional teacher and where a school's existing accommodation cannot provide for this growth, my Department will be prepared to consider applications by schools for capital funding for additional classrooms mainly on a devolved basis.  My Department has no plans to adjust the current criteria for schools accessing capital funding.</p></reply>

The remainder are appointments made in accordance with a framework agreed between the Irish Universities Association and the Higher Education Authority which allows for a departure from approved levels of remuneration.</p><p>  Framework Appointments are made by universities under the terms of a Departures Framework provided for under Section 25(5) of the Universities Act 1997.  This allows universities in very limited and exceptional circumstances, for academic and research posts, to depart from approved levels of remuneration where the governing authority is satisfied that it is necessary to meet the objects of the university.  The purpose of the Framework is to enable a university to attract a person to its staff, who would, because of exceptional or scarce expertise and/or qualifications, command remuneration higher than the norm and who would not be prepared to work for the university unless so rewarded.  Appointments made under the framework do not require the sanction of the Minister or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government introduced a salary ceiling of &euro;200,000 and this has applied to all new appointments to senior positions across the Public Service. Since becoming Minister I have written to the Chairpersons of University Governing Bodies requesting them to ask all relevant individuals, including Presidents, who earn in excess of &euro;200,000, to make voluntary waivers of salary. While two individuals, one of whom is a university Head, have agreed to make personal arrangements with their employer regarding a deduction of the amount of salary over &euro;200,000, there have been no voluntary waivers made for the benefit of the State. I cannot enforce a voluntary waiver nor can I insist that a waiver, if made, follows any particular format. For example, if an employee chooses to waive a portion of his/her salary in favour of a charity or their employer they are free to do so.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-29a.302.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052900080#WRN01100"><p>Under EU law, public contracts above a certain values must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process. The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include:  cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise;  improved consistency; and, enhanced service levels. </p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year my Department issued Circular 06/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS.   </p><p>  Where a mandatory framework arrangement exists, any public service body intending to make a purchase other than through the framework arrangement will need to ensure that it can explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs including those incurred in managing its own procurement process. </p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.  </p><p>  In relation plans for further reform of public procurement, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published late last year, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the report the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) to lead a key element of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform agenda. The new approach to public procurement will involve integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office; strengthening spend analytics and data management; much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money; examining the specifications set out for goods and services; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and strengthening supplier and category management.</p><p>  Since the appointment of Paul Quinn, CPO, on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops / meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.</p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work. To ensure the reform process take account of the needs of stakeholders further consultations will be undertaken with employees and workers&rsquo; representatives as the new Office for Government Procurement is established.  We are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p><p>  A response to the correspondence that the Deputy has referred to and provided details on in his question will issue shortly.</p></reply>

The application was then sent to a social welfare investigative officer for assessment of the level of care being provided as the person concerned did not reside with the two care recipients. The report from the social welfare investigative officer was finalised on the 9th of May 2013. The deciding officer disallowed the application on the 14th of May 2013 on the grounds that full time care and attention were not being provided.

The issues involved are complex and have implications for other areas of Government. I realise also that this is a very sensitive area for those involved and people are naturally keen that the legislation be brought forward quickly. I understand that but I also have to have regard to the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the recommendations of the Gender Recognition Advisory Group (GRAG) relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals. The Department has been taking advice on this matter including talking to the various stakeholders involved. </p><p>  I have requested the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the provisional draft Heads of Bill and, in that regard, officials from the Department will appear before the Committee in the near future.

You will be aware of the range of both administrative and legislative measures that have been put in place in the last few years to assist trustees and employer respond to the impact the financial downturn has had on the funding levels of pension scheme.

The homemaker scheme comprises a period of disregard when calculating eligibility for a State pension so time taken out of the workforce for caring duties for those who qualify for the scheme, can be disregarded when assessment is being made for State pension.  </p><p>  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994, and allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  It impacts on women in particular as it assists them to qualify for a State pension (contributory) by recognising periods spent caring for children or incapacitated persons.  The homemaker disregard will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension.   </p><p>  You may wish to note that for those who give up work to care, and the evidence suggests that it is mostly women, the recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to women. The Review shows that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.   For those who do not qualify for the State pension, the means non-contributory pension will continue to be available to those with an income need and details of same are available at www.welfare.ie </p></reply>

It outlines that every effort must be made to prevent overpayments, but, if they occur, they should be regarded as a debt to the Exchequer, and every effort will be made to recover the amounts through all available means.  Overpayments are generally defined as money obtained contrary to - or in excess of - a valid decision.  Most overpayments arise as a result of a revised decision regarding entitlement.  Deciding officers decide the effective date of a revised decision having regard to the new facts or new evidence and the circumstances of the case.  An overpayment is assessed for the period that a person was not entitled to a payment and the recovery of the overpayment is followed up by the relevant section of the Department.</p><p>The Department categorises overpayments as fraud, non-fraud and estate cases.  Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income or family status while non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer, third party or departmental error.  Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers (usually pensioners) come to light after their deaths.  The total number of cases of overpayment in each of the past five years, and the number caused by departmental error, is outlined in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total number of cases</th><th>Departmental error cases</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>46,400</td><td>3,483</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>49,100</td><td>3,768</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>42,500</td><td>4,375</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>52,600</td><td>7,204</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>63,330</td><td>6,062</td></tr></table></p><p>The Department is not in a position to publicly report overpayments recorded in 2012 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>The Department endeavours to seek the maximum level of repayments from customers in order to encourage full and prompt repayment of all debts.  We are fully committed to recovering 100% of all overpayments and an overpayment will remain on a customer's record until fully recovered.  This will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension and potentially a claim on any estate after death.</p></reply>

There are approximately 13,000 mortgage interest supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;42 million for in 2013.  The Department's review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was published in July 2010 in conjunction with the interim report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group.  The final report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group was published in November 2010.  The overarching theme was that mortgage interest supplement is not an appropriate long term support and should become a time-bound payment.  The Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group) recommended that an appropriate exit strategy should be formulated for the mortgage interest supplement recipient. </p><p>  In terms of exit strategy, the Group recommended the establishment of two &quot;mortgage to rent&quot; schemes for eligible households to access social housing supports.  Both of these schemes are to be established using the two principal sources of housing finance streams in operation within the State, approved housing bodies (voluntary housing associations) and mortgage service providers.  The Department is engaging with officials in the Housing Agency regarding the mortgage-to-rent scheme, introduced in 2012, in regards to suitable exit strategies for customers experiencing mortgage difficulties who are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  Any decision to time-bound the mortgage interest supplement must be taken within a budgetary context and within the wider context of mortgage resolution policy.</p></reply>

Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed unemployed claimant of jobseeker's allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>  Recipients of jobseeker's allowance can, subject to satisfying the requisite qualifying conditions, access a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  Supports available include the back to education programmes and back to work schemes.

These differences include both medical and non-medical criteria.  Illness benefit is a payment for insured people who cannot work due to illness.  A person may qualify if they are unable to work due to illness, satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) conditions, and are under age 66.  Illness benefit claims are medically certified initially by the customer's own general practitioner.  Departmental Medical Assessors are used to as part of subsequent review processes for ongoing illness benefit claims.</p><p>  Invalidity pension is intended for customers with more severe and longer term incapacities/illnesses with less likelihood of returning to any form of work in the immediate future.  To qualify medically for invalidity pension the person must have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and be likely to be incapable of work for at least another 12 months <b>or</b> be permanently incapable of work.  When an application for invalidity pension is made, an assessment is carried out to establish medical suitability, based upon the medical and other evidence supplied in support of the claim by the applicant and his/her treating physician.  In addition the non-medical criteria include a social insurance contributions requirement. </p><p>  Disability allowance is a means-tested allowance paid to people with a disability who meet the medical and other qualification criteria which include a means test and a habitual residence condition.  To qualify medically for disability allowance, the person must be suffering from a specified disability, illness or injury which is expected to last for at least 12 months <b>and </b>be substantially restricted in obtaining employment suitable to a person of the same age, experience and qualifications.  When an application for disability allowance is made, an assessment is carried out to establish medical suitability, based upon the medical and other evidence supplied in support of the claim by the applicant and his/her treating physician.   </p><p>  Medical conditions can also change over time and evidence provided in support of a claim made previously for one scheme may not be appropriate at a later date in connection with an application for a different scheme.  It is important therefore for the customer to provide the best and most up to date evidence for consideration by a Medical Assessor at the earliest possible stage during any claim application process.  The Department continuously reviews its processes both within and across scheme and medical areas with a view to providing the best possible customer service and the best value for money for the taxpayer in relation to the administration of schemes.</p></reply>

Specifically, the Plan commits to:</p><p>- 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015,</p><p>- At least 40 Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and</p><p>- A minimum of 30 Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.  In devising any State intervention to deliver high speed services to areas of the country where such services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market, my Department will be adopting a technology neutral approach, as required under EU law.  This means specifying our requirements rather than specifying a particular technology.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to making high speed broadband available nationwide, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business including those in Tullyallen, County Louth, can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p></reply>

The Forum includes a broad spectrum of stakeholders with knowledge or expertise in a number of key sectors including commercial fisheries.  The 60 members of the Forum were appointed following an open selection process conducted by the Public Appointments Service.  The Forum is designed to provide an opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to management and development policies and is a valuable channel of communication between the stakeholders and management in this regard.</p></reply>

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.  The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p><p>  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers.</p><p>  Under the CER's policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and latterly Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 1<i></i>report in 2006.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting towns to the natural gas network in Galway/Mayo and the CER made the decision to allow Gaslink to extend the network to eleven of these towns, including Athenry.  Prior to the roll out of each town, a detailed analysis of the loads within the town and the revenues associated with them is carried out.  There is also a requirement to secure a certain level of customers prior to the development commencing.  The gas network has been extended to seven of these towns and work is progressing on the development of the network to Tuam.  Work is also ongoing to secure economic loads in the three remaining towns prior to commencement of construction.  The three remaining towns are Athenry, Knock and Ballyhaunis.</p></reply>

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.  Despite the low level of commercial discoveries to date, working petroleum systems are known to exist in many of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore basins, as demonstrated by a number of non-commercial discoveries as well as other oil and gas indicators such as hydrocarbon shows in wells.</p><p>  Nevertheless, the oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells being drilled from the current levels of 1 to 2 wells per year.  Potential oil and gas bearing areas in Irish waters which are currently the subject of exploration activities are by their very nature, prospective, and as such not amenable to estimations of market value or potential tax contribution.</p><p>  The market value and profitability of the Corrib gas field are dependent upon a combination of factors including, the volume of recoverable gas, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production.  It will be appreciated that a number of these parameters are subject to significant variation resulting in a range of potential valuations.  Profits from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at 25% when the field goes into production.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the NBS service provider, the NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3 Mbps and 1.4Mbps, respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6 Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  The specifications included in the question refer to the NBS satellite service.  In July 2012, &ldquo;3&rdquo; upgraded the NBS satellite service whereby the minimum download speed increased from 1 Mbps to 3.6 Mbps and two satellites are utilised to enhance customer experience, at no additional cost to the subscriber.  The contracted contention ratio is the maximum allowed level but would not be the standard experience for a NBS customer since all telecommunication systems are designed on the assumption that not all users avail of the services at the same time.</p><p>  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.</p><p>  Sample customer experience reports relating to NBS satellite service are reviewed within the comprehensive monitoring process referred to above.  These reports show that customers are achieving speeds in excess of the contractual minimum and that the average peak speed is 1.56 Mbps over the last six months.</p><p>My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at nationalbroadbandscheme@dcenr.gov.ie, with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.  My officials have received no complaints regarding the upgraded NBS satellite service where contention was an issue.</p></reply>

The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012. The Survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency.</p><p>  The categorisation methodology for the survey was different to that which was used in 2011 and which provided the basis for the waiver from the household charge. That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development. Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included.  For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the local property tax would apply local authorities were asked by my Department to confirm or update the then existing list as appropriate. Oakdale Park, Templemore, Co. Tipperary was not identified by the local authority as falling into this category.</p></reply>

The main legislative provisions that apply inside smoky coal ban areas include: a ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of smoky coal;  a requirement to sell solid fuel in sealed bags with a printed notice; a requirement for commercial operators to maintain a register, if storing smoky coal for the purpose of placing on the market or on sale at a separate location outside the ban area; transportation of smoky coal in minimum quantities of 3 metric tonnes in Dublin or 1 tonne inside other ban areas; and retention of records by drivers of vehicles transporting smoky coal, detailing the type of fuel on board, who supplied it and to where it is being transported.   </p><p>  The Regulations also require that all smoky coal sold outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%. This consolidates the environmental and related human health benefits achieved by an earlier voluntary agreement with the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG), representing the majority of major coal importers.   </p><p>  Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in smoky coal must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Those who must register include all fuel wholesalers and distributors of smoky coal but only those retailers for whom 50% or more of their total annual sales proceeds are from smoky coal. However, all retailers who trade in smoky coal must ensure that their fuel wholesalers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number.   </p><p>  The Regulations are enforced by local authority authorised persons. Authorised persons may undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel as well as collect samples. A local authority may bring a prosecution under section 11 of the Air Pollution Act 1987 for breaches of the Regulations. The maximum penalty for breaches of the Regulations is a fine of &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months on summary conviction.   </p></reply>

This rental equity repayment is remitted against the local authority loan for that equity. In circumstances where the rental payments remitted exceed the interest due on the loan, the balance is set against outstanding capital, thus decreasing the balance of equity due for subsequent acquisition by the borrower . The scheme does not provide for downward valuation of the equity.   </p><p>  The rental equity value held by the local authority at the commencement of the transaction is the base value from which the rent is recalculated on an annual basis.  The rent payment starts at 4.3% of the initial rental equity balance and is increased by 4.5% per annum. Amounts paid above the variable interest rate, currently 2.75%, are credited against the outstanding rental equity balance. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s 2011 housing policy statement announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now almost concluded and I have also asked the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency to provide me with a stand alone analysis of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, will be made in the context of both pieces of work and I expect to make announcements in this regard in the near future.   </p></reply>

I am advised that these Guidelines provide that supplies or services less than &euro;5,000 in value may be purchased on the basis of verbal quotes from one or more competitive suppliers and those between &euro;5,000 and &euro;25,000 in value on the basis of responses to specifications sent by fax or email to at least three suppliers or service providers. Contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more are requested to be advertised on the national public procurement website etenders.gov.ie. While contracting authorities are not required to advertise on this website for requirements below &euro;25,000, they are encouraged to do so if the anticipated response would not be disproportionate, having regard to the value of the goods and services. Depending on the nature of the requirement, it may be appropriate to supplement national website advertising in other media, trade publications and /or other websites. </p><p>  While the local government sector must comply with such guidelines, local authorities are actively engaged with local enterprises in promoting local economic development. The Government decision to integrate the local micro-enterprise support services currently undertaken by CEBs with local authorities, and the establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), will provide a strong platform for the local authority economic role and will significantly boost the ability of local government to play a lead role in business support locally. As Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are created in local authorities, the capacity of the sector to support local businesses and deliver national policy in support of micro-enterprises will be enhanced. This will include the provision of advice and support to micro-enterprises and Small Medium Enterprises SMEs to engage with the changing procurement processes in the public sector.   </p><p>  The development of policy in relation to the inclusion of social policy clauses in procurement contracts is a matter for my colleague, the nister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   </p></reply>

In June 2012 my Department invited local authorities to submit a prioritised list of projects for funding under the CAS programme over the period 2012 to 2014. These projects were intended to be used primarily to meet the needs of persons or households with specific categories of housing need. I subsequently announced funding approval for 55 projects which involved the provision of over 370 new voluntary housing units.  Approvals were based on the prioritisation afforded to individual proposals by local authorities. The project in question was prioritised by South Dublin County Council and was intended to provide accommodation for up to 24 homeless persons at Riversdale Avenue, Palmerstown, Dublin 20 . In October, 2012 my Department approved a grant of &euro;1,185,250 for the acquisition of the properties by the Simon Community.   </p><p>  The CAS scheme is administered by local authorities an d it is a matter for each authority to oversee the development and implementation of projects in their area and to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the CAS scheme as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Memorandum VHU 2/ 02, which may be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie.</p></reply>

The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for new vehicles are calculated in accordance with specific standards for this purpose, and I am not aware that the tests can be applied in a comparable way to pre-2008 vehicles. Allowing a CO<sub>2</sub> rating to be taken at a point in time other than manufacture would potentially lead to owners of vehicles (both pre- and post-2008) providing different CO<sub>2</sub> readings over the lifetime of the vehicle, leading to significantly increased difficulty in administering the motor tax system.  Any loss in revenue arising would have to be compensated for elsewhere in the motor tax system or through the taxation system generally.  I have no plans to change the basis for charging motor tax for vehicles registered prior to 2008 from engine capacity to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review and that Kells Courthouse is included in this process. </p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.</p><p>  The Courts Service has again assured me that no decision in relation to the future of Kells courthouse will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.

The Garda Commissioner has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country.

However, Defence Ministers meet as the 'Foreign Affairs Council in Defence Ministers' format'.  These Council meetings are held in Brussels or Luxembourg at the invitation of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Baroness Catherine Ashton.  I attended the formal Foreign Affairs Council in Defence Ministers' format in Luxembourg on Sunday 22 and Monday 23 April 2013.  Catherine Ashton chaired the meeting.  The meeting commenced with a working dinner on Sunday evening which discussed the current situation in Mali and the wider Sahel region.  Discussions on Monday 23 April 2013 were dominated by preparations for the European Council debate on security and defence in December 2013.  The day began with a meeting of the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board in Ministers of Defence format which discussed work on EDA projects to enhance the development of defence capabilities and strengthen Europe's Defence industry.  Later we discussed the work of the European Commission's Defence Industry Task Force which is responsible for coordinating Defence issues within the Commission.  The meeting also discussed increasing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of Common Security and Defence Policy and focused, in particular, on the usability and flexibility of Battlegroups.</p><p>  I also hosted and chaired, on behalf of Baroness Ashton, the informal meeting of Ministers of Defence in Dublin Castle on Tuesday 12 and Wednesday 13 February 2013.  Discussions during the meeting covered a range of issues including the upcoming European Council debate on Defence, Mali, the Horn of Africa and Partnerships between the EU and the United Nations.  Mr Herve Ladsous, the United Nations Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations  attended the meeting of EU Defence Ministers for the first time.  The discussion on partnerships afforded Ministers the opportunity to discuss how to foster more effective co-operation and build partnerships in order to enhance the effectiveness of UN Peacekeeping operations.  These meetings of Defence Ministers are important in enabling Member States shape the evolution of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy, both strategically and operationally, and to work together on issues of mutual concern.</p></reply>

The unpaid SPS cases involve substantive issues concerning Court cases, inheritance issues, etc.  The DAS cases largely concern cases where the Scheme minimum stocking density requirements have not been satisfied.</p><p>  There is a formal system of appeal in place for both the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, with applicants entitled, in the first instance, to seek an internal Departmental review of a decision they are not satisfied with; this review is conducted by a more senior official, not previously involved in the case.  Thereafter, the applicant has the right of appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office, which is statutorily independent of my Department; should the applicant so wish, an oral hearing of the appeal is an option.  If necessary, applicants may then complain to the Office of the Ombudsman, should they remain dissatisfied with the appeal process at that stage.  Appeals under both Schemes are dealt with as expeditiously as possible, mindful of the particular details of individual cases; while appellants to the Agriculture Appeals Office are required to lodge their appeal with that Office within three months of having been notified of the unsuccessful outcome of the internal review within the Department, there is no regulatory time limit on subsequent appeals to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p><p>  With regards to other schemes, 1,483 eligible herdowners in Tipperary registered 46,669 animals under the Suckler Welfare Scheme in 2012.  Full or partial payment has been made to 1,224 herdowners in respect of 30,518 animals.  This Scheme provides that payment is made as each animal becomes eligible and given the nature of the Scheme 9,126 of the animals born during 2012 have not yet met all of the criteria of the Scheme.  Accordingly they have not yet become eligible for payment.</p><p>  Where all required information has been received 1,114 herds have one, or more, animal which have been found not to be in compliance with the Scheme.  Currently 127 herdowners in Tipperary have requests for reviews of negative decisions submitted and 1 herdowner has sought an appeal to the Director of the Appeals Office.  The length of time required to process reviews and appeals is subject to a number of factors, including the overall volume of these cases received from all Counties and the complexity of the cases which of their nature require individual review.</p><p>  In relation to AEOS I payments outstanding in respect of 2010, 2011 and 2012 Scheme were 7, 8 and 23 respectively.  For AEOS II, payments outstanding for the 2011 and 2012 Schemes were 88 and 30 respectively. Some 47 REPS payments remain outstanding. </p></reply>

The non-provision of funding for compensation during the compulsory phase of the BVD programme must be placed in the context of the economic benefits accruing solely to farmers arising from the eradication of this disease as well as the scarce budgetary resources available to my Department.  Eradication of BVD disease is important to farmers and the strategy of my Department remains one of concentrating its scarce resources in continuing to support Animal Health Ireland financially in its ongoing work in developing the necessary infrastructure   to eliminate the occurrence of BVD from the national herd thereby minimising financial losses for farmers and improving animal welfare.</p><p>  BVD is not comparable to either bovine TB or Brucellosis which are zoonoses, i.e. communicable to humans. The eradication of these zoonotic diseases is of public health and economic importance nationally. The benefits of the BVD programme represent a private good to farmers: profitability improves as a result of the removal of BVD persistently infected (PI)  animals from herds and the payback period for the removal of these animals is very short (6 months for dairy cattle and one year for beef cattle).</p></reply>

I would acknowledge in particular the positive and very helpful engagement of the European Parliament, which I believe made an important contribution to the Irish Presidency&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to achieve a political agreement on the reform of the CAP by the end of June. It was clear that all three institutions acknowledge the fact that important decisions need to be made in the very short term.</p><p>  I think the Parliament&rsquo;s participation was particularly valuable in allowing all three institutions to have a meaningful exchange of ideas and to better understand each other&rsquo;s positions on some of the key outstanding political issues. It also afforded the Council the opportunity to reflect on these exchanges and to have its own follow-up discussions on how the resolution of these political issues might be pursued. I have no doubt that this will prove to have been of invaluable assistance as we move into what I hope will be the final few weeks of negotiations.</p><p>  The discussion with the European Parliament took place on Monday morning, when the Council was joined by the Chairman of the Parliament&rsquo;s Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, Paolo DeCastro, the Rapporteurs on each of the four CAP reform dossiers, and the Co-ordinators from each of the Parliament&rsquo;s political groups. Mr. DeCastro and the Rapporteurs outlined their positions on key issues that included internal convergence of direct payments, coupled payments, sugar quotas, export refunds and areas of natural constraint. Ministers were then given an opportunity to state their concerns and to exchange views with the Parliament in an attempt to identify potential areas of common ground. This was a very useful and informative exchange, conducted in a very positive atmosphere in which it was clear that all three institutions remain firmly focused on achieving agreement by the end of the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  Tuesday&rsquo;s second day of the informal meeting featured a more regular Council gathering, during which I led a follow-up discussion that reflected on the outcome of Monday&rsquo;s exchanges. The positions of each of the three institutions on the respective issues were debated by my Member State colleagues, and I sought their views on how the differences between the institutions might be narrowed in the broader context of reaching a satisfactory overall agreement. Again I was very satisfied with the exchanges, which were conducted in a very positive atmosphere and underpinned by a desire to find common ground with the Parliament.</p><p>  I listened very carefully to the debate over the two days of the informal meeting, and it will very usefully inform the Presidency&rsquo;s ongoing interaction with the Parliament and the Commission as we try to reach an accommodation over the remaining trilogues and the parallel political discussions in the coming weeks. Above all, the talks in Dublin have reinforced my confidence that I will be able to present a package of measures to the Council at the end of June that will allow us to finalise an overall political agreement within the timescale we set for ourselves at the commencement of the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

Operations in a total of four plants were suspended (in some cases on a voluntary basis) for varying periods arising from the investigation.  Information in relation to activities by traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain outside of the jurisdiction has been passed to Europol and other Member States to facilitate continuing investigations in other countries.</p><p>  My Department is considering the possibility of instituting legal proceedings where appropriate, as indicated in the report.

I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.</p><p>  In support of this, a Joint Pilot Inspection of Early Years Services was carried out by Inspectors from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills between September 2011 and May 2012.  This pilot will inform the proactive approach being taken by my Department.</p></reply>

I chaired the meeting of the Youth Ministers at the Council on 16 May 2013.  At the meeting, the EYCS adopted two important policy documents: Council Conclusions on maximising the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and Council Conclusions on the contribution of quality youth work to the development, well-being and social inclusion of young people.  These conclusions include a concrete set of measures aimed at raising the profile of youth work at EU level and mainstreaming youth work into broader EU policy responses to youth employment and social inclusion.  These include: i. Establishing a new EU expert group on quality youth work; ii. Strengthening the working relationship between the Council of Youth Ministers and other Council of Minister configurations; iii. Mainstreaming youth policy input into the European Semester reporting process; iv. Recognition of centrality of youth work in contributing to the Europe 2020 growth and jobs agenda; i. Recognition of the role of youth work in implementing the proposed Youth Guarantee; ii. Greater coordination between EU youth policy and education, training and employment policies.</p><p>  Ministers also participated in a policy debate on the theme of: Europe's young people: What can quality youth work contribute to addressing current challenges?  Ministers expressed their commitment to follow up and take further actions to progress these aims.  To this end, I will host an expert round table event that will explore further the role of youth work in advancing employment and social inclusion for young people (20&ndash;21 June 2013, Kildare).  The incoming Presidency of Lithuania will focus on the youth employability and social inclusion, while stressing the importance of involving young people in these initiatives.  The Greek Presidency is committed to finalising a medium term work plan to guide the work of the Youth Council in addressing the challenges that young people face at this time.</p><p>  The work of the EYCS in the Presidency's Youth Programme over the past six months has been informed by the findings of widespread consultations with young people about the challenges they face and their priorities in an inclusive European Union.  Over 11,000 young people throughout Member States have participated in the current cycle of Structured Dialogue.  At local, national and European level, they have voiced opinions about the issues that impact on their lives and their priorities for the future.  Over 180 young people and officials from the 27 Member States participated in the highly successful EU Youth Conference which I hosted in March in Dublin.</p><p>  In addition to the formal dialogue, I hosted an informal meeting with young people from the Trio Member States (Ireland, Lithuania and Greece) and Cyprus and their respective Ministers, Commissioner Vassiliou and the European Youth Forum to hear their views in advance of the Youth Council meeting on 16 May 2013.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. </p><p>  For&oacute;ige provides a comprehensive range of youth work services through the operation of For&oacute;ige Clubs and Youth Development Projects.  There are two For&oacute;ige projects in Waterford City and these are the Ferrybank Youth Project funded under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and Ferrybank Drug Prevention Project and Outreach Service funded under the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (Round 2) A total of &euro;179,666 has been allocated to these projects in 2013. </p><p>  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which amount to &euro;5.393m in 2013, my Department has tried to ensure that in the determination process for the allocations  the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding. </p><p>  There is no doubt that the current budgetary situation is challenging for many organisations. In considering how best to manage within the allocations available organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and other overheads and to work closely with their local VEC that administers the funding on behalf of my Department, in order to maintain the front line services for young people particularly for those young people who may be disadvantaged. </p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.  The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. </p></reply>

In addition, the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate.  The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland, including key elements such as</p><p>  - guiding principles;</p><p>  - implementation structure;</p><p>  - methodology for implementation; and</p><p>  - information and communication.</p><p>  The Report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.</p><p>   The key priority areas, as identified in the HSE's National Operational Plan for 2013 are to:</p><p>  - Map and develop Integrated Service Area level rehabilitation networks;</p><p>  - Implement the model of care for rehabilitation services within the networks with a focus on community rehabilitation.</p><p>  An implementation plan beyond the overall operational plan commitments would not be beneficial, as the work involved to progress networks and teams will require to be flexible and responsive to the areas identified and to their specific service profiles.</p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has been working in collaboration with the National Disability Unit as part of an expert Working Group planning for the implementation of the Report.  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy's recommendation of &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community.  This co-operation will continue in 2013.</p></reply>

This means that where a woman has a pregnancy that places her life at risk but her foetus is viable, she may have a right to have the pregnancy brought to an end but <b>not</b> a right to insist that the life of the foetus be deliberately ended. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013 will provide for the offence of intentional destruction of unborn human life. The Bill will also set out exemptions to the offence.  In the case of suicidal intent, three specialist medical practitioners will have to jointly certify that, in their reasonable opinion, there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother and that this risk can only be averted by the termination of her pregnancy.  One of these doctors must always be an obstetrician/gynaecologist, and the other two will be psychiatrists. </p><p>  In addition, the definition of 'reasonable opinion' requires that this opinion must be formed in good faith and must have regard to protect and preserve unborn human life where practicable. The registered medical practitioners will be obliged to record this opinion in writing if certifying a procedure that will end unborn human life. </p></reply>

The Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the EU, its Member States,  and Israel, is one of a number of such agreements that have been negotiated by the European Commission over the last number of years.  Air services between the EU and Israel currently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Israel. The Agreement replaced this with a comprehensive 'open skies' agreement. In summary the Agreement aims at: </p><p>  - gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; </p><p>  - promoting regulatory cooperation and harmonisation of regulations and approaches based on EU legislation in the field of aviation; </p><p>  - promoting air services based on competition among air carriers with minimum government interference and regulation; </p><p>  - non-discrimination and a level playing field for economic operators.</p><p>  Ireland is fully supportive of the EU policy to negotiate such agreements. No Irish airline currently operates scheduled services to Israel. One Israeli airline operates a summer-only scheduled service to Ireland. However, this Agreement will open up the entire EU-Israel aviation market to Irish airlines, both Ireland-Israel routes, and services from other EU points to Israel.  The agreement will be signed at the upcoming Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council on 10 June 2013. The advice of the Attorney General is that the Agreement requires D&aacute;il approval prior to signature. The process is currently underway and is expected to be finalised this week.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  I announced the 2013 regional and local road grant allocations on 25 January this year. A total of &euro;350 million is being provided under the Regional and Local Roads Investment Programme this year.  From that allocation, Dublin City Council is being provided with an allocation of over &euro;6.2 million.</p><p>  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded from these State grants is also a matter for the local authority and it will be necessary for the Council to prioritise the works to be undertaken on regional and local roads in its administrative area from within its existing budgets.  It is also important to re-iterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Dublin City Council in their spending in this area.</p></reply>

The ITF annual summit aims to be a relatively informal, dynamic international event with the emphasis on free-flowing discussion and networking across governments and industry and Ireland's attendence as usual this year was, I consider, informative and beneficial to Irish interests.
