The matter has been discussed at the Early Years Forum which I chair, and in other fora with my Department.</p>  <p>  We are working with the Department of Education and Skills to develop a new Early Years workforce plan.  This will examine workforce supply issues.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that pay and conditions of staff is a significant barrier to retaining staff in the sector.  Whilst my Department is not an employer of childcare workers, we are a significant funder.  I am committed to the development of high quality services in this country and it has been proven that high quality care is dependent on a workforce that feels valued.  My Department is working with the sector to explore how we can improve retention rates.  The Programme for Government contains 14 commitments to improving access to high quality, affordable childcare.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme I am introducing this year will provide an important infrastructure for future investment in the Early Years sector.</p>  <p>  It is clear that we need to focus collaboratively on how best to make the early years sector as attractive and personally rewarding place in which to work.  I think that pay is only one issue, although, clearly an important one.  The fact that we are investing considerably increased resources in the sector will also be important.  In Budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in childcare funding, up by &euro;120m to &euro;466m.  This was on top of a 35% increase in Budget 2016 also.</p>  <p>  These increases reflect the emphasis I am placing on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  In this regard, the City &amp;amp; County Childcare Committees are assisting services who experience difficulties in recruiting or retaining staff, and the Learner Funds are in place to support staff in achieving minimum qualification requirements, both regulatory and contractual.</p>  <p>  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting.  I believe that by working together we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and personal development of our children.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-14a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400061#WRA01200"><p>I am pleased to confirm that I have allocated an extra &euro;5.5m in current funding to support the provision of youth services in 2017.  This will bring the total youth funding by my Department to &euro;57.4m, an increase of 10% over last year's allocation.  The additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. </p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  They involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge, and very much regret, the cuts that were made to youth funding in earlier years.</p>  <p>  My Department, along with all government departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012 &ndash; 2014.  My Department sought to ensure that front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, were protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that we have turned the tide of these cuts now, with a 10% increase this year over 2016.  My Department has carried out a Value for Money and Policy Review of a number of schemes supporting youth services.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives and made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  I want to streamline the various funding schemes for youth services so that we maximise their benefit and target money to best effect.  I have prioritised the work on developing a new integrated funding scheme as recommended by the Value for Money and Policy Review.  Consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes in a planned way.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I am committed to continuing to seek additional support for youth services in Budget 2018 and beyond.</p></reply>

I saw this for myself when I met with Greek ministers and with vulnerable families being assisted by our efforts in Greece under the Irish Refugee Programme.  I want to acknowledge the work of the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the support of our Cabinet colleagues in pushing forward the work of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and the Dail resolution on Calais .  </p>  <p>  I have asked Tusla to expand the Separated Children's team to progress the Dail resolution on unaccompanied minors who were previously in unofficial camps near Calais.  Tusla is putting in place a project office and increasing the number of staff on this team.  The additional staff will include a senior social work practitioner, social workers and social care staff.  I understand that Tusla is examining how best to manage the required psychological support for the young people, including the recruitment of a psychologist into the team.  I have been assured that residential accommodation being sourced will be homely in nature and in line with national standards.  </p>  <p>  I have committed to making sure that this service is properly resourced, and that the high standard of the current service continues.  Estimates of the cost involved will be kept under review as the situation evolves.  For example, the range of therapeutic and legal supports to be provided will only become clear once the young people have arrived and been assessed.  I am closely monitoring the emerging situation and am determined to ensure this humanitarian effort will be successful.</p></reply>

Therefore, it has been necessary for me to consult with Cabinet colleagues and the Attorney General on these matters.  I also needed to seek additional information from the Commission to assist in these deliberations and I am due to meet with the Commission again this month. </p>  <p>  I do acknowledge that this process has taken longer than I initially envisaged and I am sensitive to the expectations of former residents and their advocates in this regard.  For this reason, I also want to assure the Deputies that the Government's consideration of this Interim Report is not affecting progress of the Commission's investigations.  The Commission is continuing its comprehensive investigations with a view to completing its final report by 17 February 2018 in accordance the three year time-frame provided in its terms of reference.  The Commission will also complete its Social History Report and Confidential Committee Report by this date.</p>  <p>  I will ensure that arrangements are made to inform representative groups of developments on the Report before making any public announcement.  I hope to conclude matters as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-14a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400061#WRA02200"><p>I have given considerable thought to the question of taking rent or mortgage payments into account when calculating the subsidy under the new scheme.  In doing so, I was conscious that excluding housing costs is fairer for families with the same income but different housing choices. </p>  <p>  Allowing the deductibility of housing costs would, in effect, mean that the Affordable Childcare Scheme would part-subsidise families&rsquo; housing choices.  For example, we may consider two families that have the same income level, but one family has chosen to live in a larger or more expensive house.  If housing costs were deductible from the income-assessment for the Affordable Childcare Scheme, then the family that chose to live in a larger house would receive a larger childcare subsidy, and would do so solely because of how that family had chosen to spend its income.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme would thus provide additional financial support to families who choose larger or more expensive housing options.  If we were to allow for the deduction of housing costs, this allowance would generally benefit higher-income earners more, which would run counter to the intention of the Scheme to target supports primarily at those with the lowest incomes. </p>  <p>  Eligibility for the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) is based on net parental income, and the highest levels of support will be offered to those on the lowest incomes.  ACS is fairer and more accessible than the current targeted childcare programmes, under which many low-income families are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain State benefits or attending certain training programmes.  ACS will also enhance affordability, offering greater levels of support overall to low income families than the current targeted childcare programmes.  For example, parents on the lowest incomes, who previously received a subsidy of &euro;95 per week, may now receive a subsidy of between &euro;150 and &euro;205 per week, depending on the age of the child.  The amount payable by a parent in such a case will &ndash; in an average childcare service &ndash; fall from &euro;72 per week at present to between &euro;0 and &euro;17 per week under ACS, again depending on the age of the child.</p>  <p>  While I acknowledge the financial burden of housing costs for many families with children, ACS aims to target subsidies on the basis of an equitable assessment of the total income coming into a family.  Housing costs are not considered.  As I have already outlined, this approach to assessing means is very much in line with most means-assessment Government schemes currently in operation.</p>  <p>  I believe that this is the right way forward.  We will no doubt debate this and many other matters when the House considers the forthcoming legislation on the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-14a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400061#WRA02500"><p>I recently announced that &euro;1m of additional funding will be made available to childcare providers who have been facilitating the training of Community Employment (CE) scheme workers, to ensure that regulatory changes do not impact on service delivery or the availability of childcare places. </p>  <p>  In preparation for the implementation of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, Childcare Committees Ireland were commissioned by my Department to investigate the impact of new childcare regulations on community childcare providers.</p>  <p>  This research indicated that the vast majority of services would not face financial hardship as a result of changes required under the regulations.  However this did find that some services had come to rely on Community Employment scheme workers, and I determined that these services should be provided additional funding to enable them to recruit and retain qualified staff to work alongside their CE scheme participants. </p>  <p>  As a result, I have made available up to &euro;2,000 for services to assist with the recruitment process or to provide expert support in HR management, with additional money being provided to each service after analysis of their individual financial situation, to ensure that they can fully meet the cost of these staff.  No service will be forced to close. </p>  <p>  Delivering high quality, accessible and affordable childcare is my key goal, and this funding will ensure that every child will be cared for by a qualified professional, and that services can sustain existing levels of provision, while they prepare for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  Services are also providing more ECCE places than ever before, and I am confident that over 125,000 children will be receiving free pre-school care and education this summer. </p>  <p>  All Community Childcare services around the country were afforded an opportunity to engage with this project during 2016, and detailed analysis has been completed.  As some services clearly needed additional funding to maintain service levels, this money has now been allocated from the provision made for Sustainability Funding in Budget 2017, and will be available for drawdown from next week, with Pobal making payments on behalf of the local Childcare Committee.</p></reply>

While the concerted efforts and actions outlined in the Action Plan will result in families moving on from hotels more quickly, my Department, together with Tusla, is working to support parents and children in order to minimise, as much as possible, the impacts of living in emergency accommodation. </p><p>My Department has policy responsibility for children under 18 who present as &lsquo;out of home&rsquo; without their parent(s) or guardian(s) and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991.  Children under 16 who present as out of home to emergency services are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided with a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 (accommodation for homeless children). </p><p>A child, irrespective of accommodation status, who comes to the attention of Tusla will, where the appropriate threshold has been reached, have an assessment carried out by a social worker.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of a child, due to parenting difficulties or adverse environmental factors, they will provide family supports to assist the family and child.  Ongoing monitoring will form part of the response by Tusla where it is required.  In addition, referrals to other services e.g. mental health services, will be made where appropriate.</p><p>My Department understands that enhanced National Quality Standards for Homeless Services are currently being developed by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive on behalf of all local authorities.  A national advisory group has been in place since 2014 with representation from non-governmental homelessness service providers, the Health Service Executive, Tusla and others, as well as the housing authorities.  Draft standards were piloted in services in four of the nine homeless regions during 2016 and it is expected that they will be implemented nationally in the first half of this year.

I saw this for myself when I met with Greek ministers and with vulnerable families being assisted by our efforts in Greece under the Irish Refugee Programme.  I want to acknowledge the work of the Tanaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the support of our Cabinet colleagues in pushing forward the work of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and the Dail resolution on Calais .  </p>  <p>  I have asked Tusla to expand the Separated Children's team to progress the Dail resolution on unaccompanied minors who were previously in unofficial camps near Calais.  Tusla is putting in place a project office and increasing the number of staff on this team.  The additional staff will include a senior social work practitioner, social workers and social care staff.  I understand that Tusla is examining how best to manage the required psychological support for the young people, including the recruitment of a psychologist into the team.  I have been assured that residential accommodation being sourced will be homely in nature and in line with national standards.  </p>  <p>  I have committed to making sure that this service is properly resourced, and that the high standard of the current service continues.  The estimates of the cost involved will be kept under review as the situation evolves.  For example, the range of therapeutic and legal supports to be provided will only become clear once the young people have arrived and been assessed.  I am closely monitoring the emerging situation and am determined to ensure this humanitarian effort will be successful.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2016, funding of &euro;51m was provided to my Department for these schemes. </p>  <p>  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations amounting to &euro;10.15m.  This funding is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provided an additional &euro;5.5m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  This will bring the total youth funding in 2017 to &euro;57.4m.  This additional funding will be used, inter alia, to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  My Department has commenced the process with national organisations to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree their 2017 allocations. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provided &euro;2.6m to my Department for a capital funding scheme for youth projects and services.  Work on the development of a new capital funding scheme for 2017 is underway and I hope to announce details of this new capital scheme in the coming months.</p></reply>

Maintaining contact during imprisonment has also been correlated with reduced recidivism rates by the parent. </p><p>Following a period of research, which included a detailed survey of existing visiting facilities and supports, the Families &amp;amp; Imprisonment Group (FIG) identified a number of essential pillars that should be in place to ensure that visits in Irish Prisons become a core element of rehabilitation and support for both the people in our care and their families.  The essential pillars identified by the FIG are as follows:</p><p>- Communications</p><p>- Physical Improvements</p><p>- Staff training</p><p>- Parenting courses and resettlement interventions; and</p><p>- Community Partnerships.</p><p>A pilot parenting programme entitled &lsquo;Parenting Plus&rsquo; was developed in partnership with Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) and delivered in Limerick prison in 2015 and 2016 as part of an overall &lsquo;Family Links&rsquo; Programme.  The programme aims are:</p><p>- To support small groups of prisoners to better understand their parenting role, and to develop practical skills which support them in positive parenting;</p><p>- To develop a parenting programme specifically for the prison population, which is effective and replicable;</p><p>- To support partners of prisoners to engage positively with their children and to offer families consistent language and approaches;</p><p>- To maximise opportunities for positive parent-child engagement within the limitation of a custodial setting; and</p><p>- To increase awareness of and responsibility for supporting, positive parenting as an important element of imprisonment and resettlement planning.</p><p>A number of significant objectives have been achieved so far; most notably enhanced staff training, delivery of the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme, the establishment of more family-friendly visits, and refurbishment of visit spaces. </p><p>In addition, Family Liaison Officer training has been provided by the IPS to enable participants to:</p><p>- Understand the role and function of a Family Liaison Officer;</p><p>- Understand the logic model process, and the rationale and evidence underpinning the Family Links programme;</p><p>- Have knowledge regarding community services and structures supporting and working with children and families;</p><p>- Have an understanding of the experience of being a parent in prison and the impact on family dynamics;</p><p>- Heightened empathy for, and ability to support, parents in prison.</p><p>An independent evaluation of the Family Links Programme in Limerick which was undertaken by the University of Limerick was launched by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday (13 February) in Dublin.</p><p>Finally, I note that children may be impacted by events affecting their parents, for instance parental ill health, mental health problems or parental absence, by way of the need to work away from home or by imprisonment. </p><p>Where this is the case, parents can seek assistance from family support services in their communities by direct referral or through a child welfare referral to Tusla.  Such services can provide child counselling, family therapy or art and play therapies to help children understand and deal their feelings, and to assist the parent who is caring for them. </p><p>In relation to children (under 18) in detention any issues of concern are addressed by their individual care regimes.</p></reply>

Tusla provides financial support to some 109 communities through the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme.  This typically covers the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs.  In 2016, Tusla provided &euro;13.5m in core funding under the Programme.  Also, in December, 2016, and in recognition of the valuable work that the Family Resource Centres do, Tusla provided additional once-off funding of &euro;1.422m to the centres.  This additional funding, which was in the form of minor capital assistance, allowed for the upgrade of equipment and other remedial works at centres.  </p>  <p>  Last November, I met with representatives from the Kildare Youth Service, Kildare Children and Young People's Service Committee, Kildare Local Community Development Committee and the Tusla Area Manager in relation to the provision of services to children and young people in Co. Kildare.</p>  <p>  At that meeting, I was informed of a number of issues including a request for the provision of additional Family Resource Centres in Co. Kildare.  I advised the Co. Kildare representatives at the meeting to submit a Business Case to Tusla in relation to the establishment of new Family Resource Centres in the County as Tusla provides financial support to Family Resource Centres under its Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme. </p>  <p>  Tusla plans to build on the strengths of the programme in the years ahead to deliver its mandate for community-based early intervention and family support. </p>  <p>  Tusla is currently finalising details of the funding to be allocated to the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme, and will be confirming funding levels for individual centres shortly. </p></reply>

The programme commenced in 2013 and was designed as a time-bound co-funding arrangement for the period 2013 to 2017 in conjunction with the Atlantic Philanthropies.</p><p>The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children, and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.  The ABC programme is currently being evaluated by the Centre for Effective Services.</p><p>Data is being collected locally at the Area-level so as to assess the success and effectiveness of the totality of the investment across the five broad outcomes of the Programme.  </p><p>Three national programme outcomes concern the achievement of outcomes for individual children and their parents participating in ABC-funded services:</p><p>I. Improved child health and development;</p><p>II. Improved children&rsquo;s learning;</p><p>III. Improved parenting.</p><p>The remaining two outcomes are concerned with achieving systems change among service providers:</p><p>I. Integrated service delivery;</p><p>II. Services embedded in mainstream services.</p><p>The national evaluation is focussing on three core evaluation questions:</p><p>1. How did the outcomes for children and families in ABC Areas change? </p><p>2. To what extent did the ABC Programme make progress in implementing evidence-informed programmes and approaches in the ABC Areas?</p><p>3. What costs were associated with the services provided under the ABC Programme?</p><p>The final national evaluation report will be produced in 2018.  However, preliminary analysis of initial outcomes data indicates promising impact.</p><p>A key purpose of the ABC programme is to identify the learning across the sites and transfer this learning into existing and established services.  In budget 2016, my Department secured an additional &euro;4.5 million to extend all of the existing ABC programme to the end of December 2017, bringing the total investment to &euro;34.2 million.  This extension also brings the existing programme closer in line with the expected timeline for delivery of the national evaluation report in 2018.  We will utilise the learning from the programme and the findings from the national evaluation to inform the design of prevention and early intervention initiatives that comprehend the Programme for Government commitments.  </p><p>I look forward to the continued engagement of all ABC sites with my department in 2017 as we work towards the implementation of quality prevention and early intervention initiatives in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland.</p></reply>

Those who have left care before the changes, and who do not have an aftercare plan, can under these amendments obtain an aftercare plan from Tusla up to their 21st birthday.  Tusla is identifying gaps in the aftercare service nationally and has indicated that this will require an expansion in aftercare management and workers.  Tusla is currently finalising arrangements for the publication of its 2017 Business Plan which sets out the priorities for these important services in 2017.  Tusla's 2017 budget was increased by &euro;37 million this year, bringing the Tusla funding to over &euro;700 million in exchequer funding, and this included additional funding to support service delivery to implement legislation.</p><p>I am concious that the transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people.  A key factor in achieving success is ensuring that assessment, preparation and planning for leaving care begins in the years prior to leaving care and continues as part of the care planning process.  This work is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate an aftercare plan that is specific to the individual young person's needs.  Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of the supports available to care leavers.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may appreciate, the needs of the young people have to be assessed carefully.  At the moment it appears that many will need support in a residential setting.  The resources required will need to be monitored closely as the process unfolds.  Tusla is part of the delivery of Ireland's commitments to the EU and UN which are being coordinated under Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  Tusla's Separated Children Seeking Asylum team also receive unaccompanied minors who present at our ports and are referred by the immigration services.</p>  <p>  Based on current commitments and the likely number that will be referred from immigration services, which can vary from year to year, it is expected that there will be at least 160 unaccompanied minors received by Tusla's Separated Children Seeking Asylum team over the course of the year.  </p>  <p>  The separated children's team is being expanded to include additional social workers, social care staff and residential centres for assessment and accommodation.  This team has developed a well regarded set of expertise and supports to work with children and young people who are found to be unaccompanied minors when they arrive at our borders.  I understand that Tusla is examining how best to address the psychological supports needed for the service, including the option of recruiting a psychologist onto the team.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that the residential accommodation and additional staff to expand the separated children's team is in hand.  I have committed to providing Tusla with the necessary funding to expand this service and I am closely monitoring this to ensure this humanitarian effort will be successful.</p></reply>

This typically covers the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs.  In 2016, Tusla provided &euro;13.5m in core funding under the Programme.  In addition, Tusla provided funding of &euro;595,000 to Family Resource Centres for counselling services under the Agency's Counselling Grants Scheme.  Also, in December, 2016, and in recognition of the valuable work that the Family Resource Centres do, Tusla provided additional once-off funding of &euro;1.422m to centres.  This additional funding, which was in the form of minor capital assistance, allowed for the upgrade of equipment and other remedial works at centres. </p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres are supported by two Regional Support Agencies, which are funded by Tusla under the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme.  These support agencies play a key role in promoting good practice, providing technical support, advice and training to Family Resource Centres.</p>  <p>  Tusla also provides funding under the Programme to the Family Resource Centre National Forum.  The Forum operates as a network for all Family Resource Centres.  It provides networking and training opportunities, and information and support.</p>  <p>  Tusla plans to build on the strengths of the programme in the years ahead as it delivers on its mandate for community-based early intervention and family support. </p>  <p>  Tusla is currently finalising details of the funding to be allocated to Family Resource Centres in 2017, and will be confirming funding levels for individual centres shortly.</p></reply>

These provisions include those related to mandated reporting of child abuse, mandated assisting and the preparation of Child Safeguarding Statements by organisations providing relevant services to children. </p>  <p>  The phased implementation timetable will also allow Tusla to undertake the significant preparatory work required to enable it to fully meet its obligations under the legislation.  This will include ensuring that the appropriate internal systems are in place to deal with the intake of mandatory reports by Tusla and that a suite of resources is available to support and assist all sectors in implementing the legislation.

I was delighted to receive an additional &euro;5.5m in current funding in Budget 2017 to support the provision of youth services, bringing the total youth funding in 2017 to &euro;57.4m.  This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  My Department has commenced the process with national organisations to identify service development needs for 2017 and to agree their 2017 allocations. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.

Tusla is putting in place a project office and increasing the number of staff on this team.  The additional staff will include a senior social work practitioner, social workers and social care staff.  I understand that Tusla is examining how best to manage the required psychological support for the young people, including the recruitment of a psychologist into the team.

I am sure you will understand that the estimates of the cost involved will be kept under review as the situation evolves.  For example, the range of therapeutic and legal supports to be provided will only become clear once the young people have arrived and been assessed.  I am closely monitoring the emerging situation and am determined to ensure this humanitarian effort will be successful.</p></reply>

I have devoted all of my professional life in Ireland to the development of community based approaches to tackle children's poverty and designing and delivering effective prevention and early intervention strategies to do same.</p><p>In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, the Government set a child-specific poverty target in <i>Better Outcomes, Better Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020 </i>to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two-thirds by 2020.  This figure currently represents 102,000 children.  The rate of consistent poverty among children has fallen to 11.5%, from 12.7% in 2014.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty.  It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed.</p><p>Officials in my Department are working closely with the Department of Social Protection in informing the development of this cross-sectoral priority.</p><p>Officials in the Department of Social Protection have co-convened a subgroup with members of the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>to progress solutions to child poverty.  In recognition of the fact that child poverty is a multi-faceted problem, this group includes officials from other Departments, including the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>Led by the Department of Social Protection, this group has produced a paper which outlines a whole of government approach to tackling child poverty.  This is based around the three pillars outlines in the EU Recommendation on Investing in Children:</p><p>- Access to adequate resources</p><p>- Access to affordable quality services</p><p>- Children&rsquo;s right to participate.</p><p>This paper covers issues relating to my Department, such as childcare, prevention and early intervention and family support, as well as issues in other Departments, such as healthcare inequalities, DEIS schools, and income supports.  It also recognises that children of lone parents are particularly at risk of poverty.</p><p>My Department is developing a Single Affordable Childcare Scheme to provide families with good quality childcare at a cost they can afford. Budget 2017 provided additional funding for the scheme&rsquo;s development and initial roll-out, to include both a targeted and a universal element.  Subsidies will be available for children aged from 6 months up to 15 years and will meet families&rsquo; full-time and part-time childcare needs, including outside of school hours and during school holiday time.  The highest levels of subsidy will be provided to those on low incomes, helping families to overcome disadvantage and contribute to a reduction in child poverty.</p><p>This paper will be discussed at the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium in February, which includes representatives from all government departments, and is responsible for whole of government implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</i></p></reply>

Section 11 of the 1988 Act, which gives effect to Chapter 4 (Transfer of Personal Data to Third Countries) of the Directive, generally prohibits such transfers unless the third country concerned ensures an adequate level of data protection.  Article 25 of the 1995 Directive provides that the European Commission may, following an examination of the applicable standards and safeguards, adopt a decision to the effect that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection by reason of its domestic law or international commitments that it has entered into.  Member States are required to comply with such a decision. </p>  <p>  On 12 July 2016, the European Commission adopted Decision (EU) 2016/1250 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-US Privacy Shield.  This means that the Privacy Shield's data protection standards and safeguards are recognised as adequate for the purposes of facilitating transfers of personal data to US organisations which have signed up to it.  Article 4 of the Decision states that the European Commission will continuously monitor the functioning of the EU-US Privacy Shield with a view to assessing whether the United States continues to ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data transferred thereunder from the EU to organisations in the US.  It also provides for an annual review of its operation.  The importance of ongoing and continuous monitoring is, therefore, fully recognised and the European Commission is required to report to the Member States on any shortcomings or deficiencies that may emerge.  Apart from the Privacy Shield, transfers of personal data to the US may take place on the basis of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.  The adequacy of protection levels afforded by such clauses is currently the subject of proceedings before the Irish High Court.</p></reply>

While noting the positive benefits to society of the interconnected digital world in which we live, the report also noted the negative aspects and the emerging trend to engage in online communications that cause significant harm to others.  The key recommendations of the report are that:  </p><p>- The existing offence of sending threatening or indecent messages should be extended to apply to all online communications. </p><p>- The offence of harassment should be extended to include all forms of communication, including online or digital communications.</p><p>-  A specific offence of stalking should be created. </p><p>-  A new offence should be created of non-consensual distribution of intimate images with intent to cause harm or distress (generally referred to as &ldquo;revenge pornography&rdquo;). </p><p>- A new offence should be created to address the taking and distribution of intimate images without consent, whether or not there is intent to cause harm or distress. </p><p>In December 2016, the Government gave its approval for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill which would provide for new and amended criminal offences along the lines set out in that report.  This Bill will address the criminal law aspects of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report.  The Commission has proposed extending some existing offences and creating some new criminal offences.  </p><p>The precise formulation of the offences will be subject to review and potential variation during the drafting of the General Scheme.</p><p>By way of providing the public with tools to deal with the ever evolving world of online communications, the Office for Internet Safety in my Department has a booklet aimed at parents and dealing specifically with the issue of cyberbullying.

The report from the then Garda Commissioner was received in March 2011 and made it clear that there was no evidence that the individual in question was involved in any criminal activities here.  The report also outlined the position in respect of the basis on which co-operation from police services in other jurisdictions might be sought in special circumstances relating to the presence in this State of persons with a record of violence whose identities would be unknown to the Garda Authorities and who might seek to foment or shape violent protest here or to engage in other criminal activities in the State.  The report also emphasised the need for confidentiality in respect of any such arrangements that might be put in place.</p>  <p>  In the light of developments which have taken place outside this jurisdiction since these matters first came to light, including the establishment in 2015 by the UK Government of an inquiry into undercover policing in England and Wales since 1968 (the Pitchford Inquiry), I requested a fresh report from the Garda Commissioner on any issues arising.  In seeking that report, I have not sought to circumscribe in any way the information which the Garda Commissioner would provide.  I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that they have met with their counterparts in the London Metropolitan Police Service and will remain in ongoing contact with them in respect of this issue.</p>  <p>  As I have stated to the House previously, I will fully consider this report when it is available, including the issue of whether it may be suitable for publication.</p>  <p>  My colleague Minister Flanagan met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland yesterday and, as part of their wider discussions, raised with him concerns that have been expressed in this House on matters relating to the Pitchford Inquiry.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland agreed to convey those concerns to the Home Secretary.</p></reply>

This followed a process of dialogue with the national level Traveller NGOs during 2015 which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or expenditure implications arising from such recognition.  The key point is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced.</p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014).  I made a presentation to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform in relation to this issue in December 2016 following which an invitation was extended to Traveller representatives to meet that Cabinet Committee to further these discussions; that latter meeting took place on 06 February 2017 and further engagement at this level is planned.

Very serious complaints relating to the assault incident in 2006 were brought to my attention late in 2014.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has since conducted a detailed investigation of the matters raised.

The study suggested that, instead, a broader based index should be used to reduce volatility and provide certainty with regard to payments under a PPO to catastrophically injured persons.</p><p>The issue of indexation of PPOs was considered in detail by an Inter-Departmental Working Group on Legislation on Periodic Payments Orders, which was established to examine the technical aspects of introducing PPOs.  The Working Group was of the view that the index specified in the legislation should provide as much certainty as possible for defendants in terms of projected increases in their financial liabilities, should not lead to an unacceptable degree of statistical fluctuation, should not be unduly volatile and should take account of the type of costs incurred by claimants and the changes to those costs over time. A number of different options were considered by the Working Group which concluded that, to meet the criteria set out above, an index based on the Irish Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), and not the Consumer Price Index, as suggested by the Deputy, should be the initial index specified in the Bill.  </p><p>Section 2 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017 provides for the insertion of a new Part IVB (sections 51H to 51O) into the Civil Liability Act 1962 to give the courts power to award damages by way of periodic payments orders in catastrophic personal injury cases.  The new section 51L deals with the issue of indexation of periodic payments.  The section provides for the annual adjustment of a payment under a PPO in line with the prevailing rate under the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices.  </p><p>However, the Deputy may wish to note that section 51L will also require the Minister for Justice and Equality, not less than 5 years after the commencement of the new Part IVB, to carry out an initial review of the application of the HICP to determine its suitability for the purposes of the annual adjustment of the amount of payments provided for under PPOs.  If, following the review, an alternative index is considered to be more suitable for the purposes of PPOs, the Minister for Justice and Equality may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations specifying an alternative index to be used in adjusting payments under PPOs.  Section 51L also provides for further reviews of the suitability of the index at 5-yearly intervals.</p></reply>

The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation of gambling, including betting and gaming but excluding the National Lottery.  It will provide for the licensing of all forms of on-line gambling.</p>  <p>  It is the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest opportunity.  In support of these efforts the Government has delegated powers of the Minister for Justice and Equality under the gaming and lotteries legislation to me as Minister of State.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will recall, the General Scheme was referred to what was at the time the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration and observations.  The Joint Committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings following which it issued a report on 6 November 2013 which contained 8 conclusions and was laid before the Houses.</p>  <p>  The 2013 General Scheme provides for the conferring of responsibility for all regulatory matters in this area on the Minister for Justice and Equality, including licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it envisages that these functions would be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality.  The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally.</p>  <p>  The Gambling Control Bill will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling.  The 2013 Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way.  These measures include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.</p>  <p>  Pending the bringing forward of the main Bill, which is a major undertaking, I have also asked my Department to examine whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill, which could be dealt with early this year by separate legislative measures.  A number of such measures are, therefore, under active consideration and will be included in the Scheme of the forthcoming Courts and Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which is, under the Government Legislation Programme, to be submitted for legislative scrutiny early this year.  This initial approach will, as I have indicated, be augmented by the completion of the more complex work on the main Bill for Government approval and publication in due course.</p>  <p>  I and officials of my Department are continuing to consult with relevant stake-holders, including those with experience in dealing with persons for whom gambling has become a problem and, as I have outlined, I intend to move forward as quickly as possible with the appropriate legislation.</p></reply>

I understand that there is currently no agreed international or multilateral framework for such mutual recognition and no successful known precedent in place elsewhere between two or more jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  Since late 2013, the main identified obstacle to the project is the service of summonses on individuals residing in Northern Ireland in relation to road traffic offences which occurred in this jurisdiction.  Ensuring a summons can be served in another jurisdiction and accepted as properly effected when the case arrives at a court hearing is central to the success of the project.  </p>  <p>  The process for issuing summonses relating to unpaid Fixed Charge Notices (FCNs) for road traffic offences in this jurisdiction involves the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Fixed Charge Processing Office forwarding an electronic file of unpaid FCNs to the Courts Service in order that the Courts Service can generate these summonses.  As such, summonses relating to road traffic offences in this jurisdiction are not issued judicially but rather are generated by the Courts Service on an administrative basis in keeping with automated nature of the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS). </p>  <p>  A number of challenges have been identified, insofar as summons service for individuals residing outside this jurisdiction is concerned, with the result that such summons service is currently incompatible with the FCPS and its administrative relationship with the Courts Service.  As such, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is unable to serve summonses on individuals residing in Northern Ireland in relation to road traffic offences which occurred in this jurisdiction for the purpose of securing the attendance of defendants residing in Northern Ireland at court proceedings in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have met with the Office of the Attorney General on a number of occasions over the past year to discuss the difficulties encountered by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning the service of summonses on individuals residing in Northern Ireland in relation to road traffic offences which occurred in Ireland and in relation to securing the attendance of defendants residing in Northern Ireland at court proceedings in Ireland.  My Department has formally requested the Office of the Attorney General to consider the issue and challenges in question and to revert with legal advice.  My officials will work closely with that Office to progress a legal solution to this important road traffic enforcement matter as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  It will be necessary to successfully resolve the considerable challenges in relation to summons service before other legislative changes to enable mutual recognition of penalty points can be considered further.  The issue of co-operation with the UK on a range of criminal justice measures is under active consideration in my Department as part of the preparations for Brexit and this issue is one which will fall to be considered as part of that process. </p></reply>

As the Deputy knows, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the migration crisis that had developed on the southern shores of the European Union.  Under this decision a programme office was established in my Department to oversee the operational aspects of the programme, which aims to bring in 4,000 vulnerable migrants to Ireland under two different mechanisms, refugee resettlement - operated by the Office for Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) - and asylum seeker relocation.</p>  <p>  The IRPP deals with all aspects of a migrant's life from the moment they are selected for relocation or resettlement to their transportation to Ireland and eventual settlement in the communities around the state.  As the Deputy is aware, a number of persons are being accommodated in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) located in Mosney Accommodation Centre under the relocation strand of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).</p>  <p>  The services being provided to families include education, the services of a General Practitioner, HSE medical screening, and access to the services of the Department of Social Protection.  A core part of the job of the IRPP is coordination and ensuring appropriate service delivery.</p>  <p>  The relevant services are provided locally or in some cases are provided at the centre.  The mode of service provision is determined on a case by case basis depending on the local situation and the individual circumstances of the asylum seekers.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made to mainstream services with local populations while not impacting on the delivery of local services.  Thus children in Mosney attend local schools and adults are provided with English language classes by the local ETB.</p>  <p>  The provision of English language supports comes under the remit of the Louth Meath Education and Training Board (LMETB).  It is important to note that when engaging with persons seeking English language supports, that in the first instance, all applicants once facilitated in the application process by trained front line LMETB staff, are then individually assessed, so as to identify the nature/extent, if any of their current language levels in English.  This would encompass both written and spoken English.  Once levels have been established, a review is conducted to establish the cultural/ethnic backgrounds from which applicants are coming.</p>  <p>  This information, alongside the established levels, enables the LMETB to place applicants in small but reasonably cohesive groups of similar level.  The Deputy may be aware and it is important to note that, alongside presenting with little or no English language proficiency, significant numbers of learners in this category also present with no/little literacy capability in their mother tongue, thus the level of difficulty in tutoring is somewhat compounded by lack of awareness of basic alphabet in either mother tongue or English language.</p>  <p>  Based upon many years of experience working with this client group, LMETB management have established through analysis of data that the intensive English classes being provided are not on their own enough to build proficiency levels with any type of speed.  To address this, LMETB introduced a pilot scheme two years ago requiring all adults attending English language classes to also attend parallel conversational classes, and this has significantly improved the  language ability of adults attending ESOL programmes in centres.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the provision of English language classes in the Mosney centre is conducted in partnership with the management authorities of the centre and with whom LMETB meet regularly to plan for and discuss the nature and type of provision /facilities to be provided on site in the Mosney centre.</p>  <p>  The timing of the arrivals played a huge part in the planning and delivery.  The first three groups were assessed and placed in classes within a week.  The classes were assigned two three hour sessions per week.  However, a group who arrived in to Mosney in November which translated into two class groups were assessed on 28 November.  It was agreed that they would do conversational English with the Mosney Support team up to Christmas and then commence their classes in January due to the fact that the term had only two weeks left before Christmas.</p>  <p>  A further group of 131 people (which translated into 8 class groups) arrived into Ireland on 16 December and were assessed by LMETB on 9 January.  Due to the large volume of learners and the timing (Christmas/New Year period) it was not possible for the LMETB to recruit new tutors at such short notice.  Officials of the IRPP discussed this with the LMETB and it was agreed that in order to ensure that everyone got some level of English tuition, the classes would be offered three hours per week temporarily until new tutors were put in place.</p>  <p>  A group who arrived into Mosney in November, which was due to begin classes in January did not attend at all, despite a tutor being available to teach them.</p>  <p>  The LMETB offered to change the timetable to facilitate anyone who could not attend during the daytime.  One of the classes for the most recently arrived group is currently running on Wednesday evening.  LMETBs on-site coordinator of services has sent out written reminders, has contacted Mosney staff to assist and has now arranged with IRPP officials to have an interpreter to help facilitate a meeting with those who have not attended to ascertain why they have not attended.</p>  <p>  My officials have informed me that the LMETB is currently recruiting ESOL tutors both within and outside of the organisation to address the needs of both the Refugee and Asylum Seeker population within Mosney.  As well as providing similar supports to those within the community, the LMETB Adult Literacy Service (ALS) runs adult learning classes for both asylum seekers and refugees in the Education Centre in the Mosney Reception Centre.  The Adult Literacy Service liaises through the Mosney Inter-agency Committee with a number of agencies who support the residents of Mosney.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Refugee Resettlement Programme, ALS provides English language training and orientation training for incoming refugees while resident in Mosney.  LMETB ALS liaises specifically with the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and other local agencies to ensure that the transition process for those people who have fled war torn countries is managed smoothly and humanely.</p>  <p>  All of the learners are assessed and their levels are mapped to the QQI levels and the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for Languages.  CEFR is a guideline used to describe achievements of learners of foreign languages across Europe.  Courses are offered at beginner A0 level to A2 QQI L3.</p>  <p>  An orientation programme is being run to accompany the language training programme and it covers a range of areas including essential Information that groups of families would need, Geography, Childcare and Safety, Children&rsquo;s Safety, Road Safety, Common Sign in Ireland, The Law in Ireland, Appropriate Dress, Food and Hygiene, Money Management and Services, Accommodation and Transport, Education and a module on moving towards independence.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the persons who are accommodated in the EROCs in both Monasterevin and Clonea Strand are programme refugees who arrive in Ireland with refugee status.  By contrast, the persons accommodated in the EROC located in Mosney (and Ballaghaderreen in the near future) are asylum seekers who are relocated from Greece under the two EU Council decisions dealing with relocation.  They therefore do not arrive in Ireland with refugee status but as asylum seekers whose claim for asylum has yet to be determined.  There are therefore some differences in the processes that must be gone through in relation to these two groups.  However, it is my view and that of the officials within the IRPP that there should be a broadly identical approach taken to language provision as between the two different groups and that is something we will be working towards, in conjunction with the relevant ETBs, over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to inform the Deputy that it is intended to start settling the earliest cohort of relocated persons currently in Mosney, a small number of whom arrived in Ireland in June, in the community in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Any unauthorised disclosure of information can seriously impede the investigation of an offence and the apprehension or prosecution of suspected offenders and can seriously undermine public confidence in the ability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out its functions.  As an organisation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes its responsibility for the control of the information it possesses very seriously. </p>  <p>  I would mention that it is an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1963 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as for any public official, to disclose official information without lawful authority.  It is also, quite separately, a distinct offence under section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make an unauthorised disclosure of information obtained in the course of duty if the member knows that such disclosure is likely to have a harmful effect.  The section sets out a list of instances of harmful effect covered by this offence, which includes for example disclosures which result in the publication of personal information constituting an unwarranted and serious infringement of a person's right to privacy.

The programme is the outcome of a comprehensive review of foundation training for entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and exemplifies best practice. </p><p>Phase 1, which lasts 32 weeks, is based in the Garda College and places a strong emphasis on problem-based learning where students learn in small groups through engagement with realistic policing scenarios.  This methodology emphasises the development of &lsquo;learning to learn&rsquo; skills, the development of reflective practice and supports the transition into learning in an operational policing environment. </p><p>Phase 2, which lasts for 65 weeks, is primarily based in Garda stations with appropriate training and development structures in place that include access to a trained tutor Garda and a permanently appointed supervisory sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  During the course of their placement, trainees move through three development stages from assisting his or her Garda tutor to taking the lead role and being assisted by the tutor, to finally the autonomous stage where they are deployed in regular policing activity and work independently within the operational unit.  Over the course of the placement they also return to the Garda College for a number to weeks to further enhance their skills in specialist areas including sexual assault, intelligence &ndash;led policing, file preparation and court presentation and so on. </p><p>Phase 3 consists of seven weeks of preparation for final exams and assessments.</p><p>At the end of Phase 1 successful Garda trainees are attested (i.e. become members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with full police powers) and are dispersed to Garda stations throughout the country, where they are assigned to mainstream policing duties.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that training has been provided to tutor Garda&iacute; and supervisory Sergeants in the 63 designated stations outlined in the following table.

While straightforward cases are generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time, particularly with regard to establishing whether the conditions for naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence are satisfied.</p><p>In many cases delays can arise as further documentation may be required from the applicant and/or payment of the certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not engaged with the office.  In some instances delays can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example where information comes to light which requires further investigation.  In other instances the applicant may request that a hold be put on their application, for example where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.  </p><p>Following a review of outstanding cases carried out in October last year, applicants with outstanding applications are being written to informing them that a time limit is being imposed to pay the requisite certificate fee (which consists the bulk of cases) or to supply documentation which was requested.  Requests for an extension of the deadline were acceded in some instances taking account of individual circumstances. </p><p>In cases where no valid reason has been advanced for a delay in fee payment or supply of requested documents, or where the applicant has not responded to correspondence over a lengthy period of time, a further submission may be made recommending the refusal of the application and closure of the case.  </p><p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the number of current citizenship applications by year the applications were made, are as per the following table.

One of the available phased payment options is Deduction at Source from ten separate payment schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that deductions are not taken from Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance as the temporary and intermittent nature of these benefits could result in shortfalls in the amount of LPT deducted leaving property owners with outstanding liabilities at year-end.  Also, the concept of a de minimis welfare payment from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) is enshrined in social welfare legislation and deductions that would have the effect of reducing a person's take-home amount to below the minimum weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, currently &euro;186 per week, cannot be made.</p>  <p>  In cases where LPT cannot be deducted from DSP payments, there are other phased payment options available to assist property owners in spreading the liability over the course of the year.  These options include monthly Direct Debits through banks and certain credit union accounts and flexible payments through four approved Payment Service Providers including An Post, Payzone, Omnivend and PayPoint.  Each of these service providers applies various transaction charges that are outside of Revenue's control.</p>  <p>  The option to defer payment of LPT is provided for in the LPT legislation including full Deferral and Partial Deferral (50%) of LPT liabilities for property owners meeting certain conditions including 'Income Level', 'Hardship', 'Personal Insolvency' and 'Personal Representative of a Deceased Person'.  The income threshold for a full deferral is &euro;15,000 (single person) per annum and &euro;25,000 (couple) per annum and for a partial deferral is &euro;25,000 (single person) per annum or &euro;35,000 (couple) per annum.  These thresholds can also be increased by 80% of any gross mortgage interest payments.  However, 'Deferral' and 'Partial Deferral' are not exemptions and the tax becomes payable at a later date and carries an annual interest rate of 4%.</p>  <p>  Any property owners who wish to apply for a 'Deferral' or 'Partial Deferral', can access their records online at www.revenue.ie and amend the payment instruction as required.  Alternatively they can contact the LPT Helpline at 1890200255 where an agent will confirm any balances due and assist with making alternative payment arrangements, including Deferral/Partial Deferral as necessary.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that because of their obligation to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information they cannot comment on claims concerning the prices charged by a taxpayer in the course of their business.  The Deputies will be well aware that prices are a matter to be agreed between buyers and sellers and that many factors influence price levels, including quality, consistency, traceability, etc.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that they responded to a number of questions raised by the Commission on the application of the Flat-Rate Scheme for Farmers in the agricultural sector in Ireland.  I am also advised that Revenue cannot make available a copy of their response to the Commission's questions because of their legal obligation to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information.  Deputy Connolly will appreciate that in certain instances the number of taxpayers in a particular sector or sub sector is such that they could be identified in commentary relating to that sector or sub sector.</p>  <p>  The status of the Commission's enquiries into this matter is a matter for the Commission and I regret that I am unable to assist Deputy Connolly on this point.</p></reply>

This is a policy area that the Government will keep under active review in its ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.</p></reply>

Therefore, Ireland is not eligible as GDP growth was strongly positive in 2015 and is forecast, in Budget 2017, to remain positive over the outlook horizon at 4.2% in 2016, 3.5% in 2017 and 3.4% in 2018.  In addition, according to the Commission's Winter 2017 forecasts the output gap is forecast to be positive this year and next.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully aware of the importance and need for capital investment.  In the 2016 Summer Economic Statement, the Government set out plans to invest an additional &euro;5.14 billion over the period to 2021.  This increase is reflected in the gross voted capital projections.  The outturn for 2016 of &euro;4.24 billion will increase to nearly &euro;7.3 billion per annum by 2021.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is undertaking a capital review this year to ensure that capital spending is fully aligned with national economic and social priorities.  This increase in gross voted capital relies to a large extent on the capital smoothing feature used in the expenditure benchmark, a flexibility built into it to, inter alia, encourage increases in capital formation.  So the Government is making use of the flexibility in the Pact. </p>  <p>  At EU level, Ireland supports the European Commission's &euro;315 billion Investment Plan for Europe, which includes the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI). EFSI commenced operations in July 2015 from which time it has been possible for any project promoter, either public or private, to engage with the European Investment Bank regarding the possibility of receiving loans or guarantees under EFSI for particular projects.</p>  <p>  Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP companies.  In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  In addition, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has successfully engaged with European Financial Instruments such as the COSME and the InnovFin Guarantee Programme, both of which are made available under the EFSI SME Window.  These support the financing needs of SMEs and aims to ensure that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.</p>  <p>  President Juncker launched a Commission proposal to extend EFSI both in terms of time and financial capacity on 14 September last and Ireland is fully engaged in the discussions towards securing an agreement that will continue to support investment across the EU including in Ireland. </p></reply>

However it should be remembered that each EFSI loan entered into by the State pre-commits funding for the repayment of such loans, and has to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.  The answer, therefore, is not simply about spending more; it is about matching the most appropriate source of funding with investment needs, and ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent wisely.</p><p>Since EFSI's inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP companies.  In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  </p><p>Also recently announced, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) agreed to support a &euro;112 million investment in privately owned forests across Ireland.  This new engagement with Dasos, a specialist forestry investment fund, represents the first forestry project in the E.U., to be supported by EFSI.  The ISIF will provide &euro;55 million and the EIB, through EFSI, will provide &euro;28.5 million for the scheme.  Additional support is expected from other investors as the initiative progresses.  The scheme will seek to address issues faced by small scale forests across the country by working to improve forest management and strengthen the supply of wood for commercial use.  The investment will support crucial upgrades to Ireland's forestry infrastructure through the consolidation of its management.</p><p>Given my Department and the NTMA have limited capital expenditure, the EFSI SME window is of most relevance to my Department.  Through this window, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has successfully engaged with European Financial Instruments such as the COSME and the InnovFin Guarantee Programmes.  In 2016, the SBCI successfully applied for a &euro;100 million guarantee facility under the COSME programme.  The SBCI will use this facility to support the delivery of the Agri Cash Flow Support Loan Fund for Farmers as announced in Budget 2017, on behalf of Department of Agriculture Food and  the Marine.

These are costs which homeowners in other households have to fund themselves for their own properties. </p>  <p>  Revenue from the LPT accrues to local authorities and supports the provision of local services.  Local authorities provide a broad range of services in the public realm, which benefit the wider community.  The proper functioning of these services are important for the wellbeing of every community and household.  These include: fire and emergency services; road maintenance and cleaning; street lighting; spatial and development planning and other similar services; regulatory and inspection functions and business support services, as well as libraries, parks, and other recreation and cultural public amenities.  The benefits of these services accrue to all members of society.</p>  <p>  A requirement to pay management fees is not relevant in determining whether a property is subject to the LPT.  Accordingly, whilst those who are liable for management fees to property management companies may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation, there is no specific exemption for the payment of management fees, nor is there provision to offset the VAT paid on management fees against LPT.  There are no plans to change this basis of liability to LPT.</p></reply>

Revenue continues to enhance their service offering  and, in particular, the channels through which their customers can obtain information and/or engage with them. For example as regards key tax and duty information, Revenue is currently re-designing its website to better meet the need of taxpayers for clear and easy to understand information. </p><p>Many taxpayers prefer to do business online and at a time of their convenience.  To meet that need, Revenue has in place modern, high-quality, accessible and user friendly online services for taxpayers to manage their tax affairs at a time that best suits each taxpayer.  Revenue continues to enhance those services and recent on-line developments include the facility for PAYE customers to file their tax returns online; the 'myaccount' service, eTax Clearance and the 'MyEnquiries' secure online enquiry facility.  Additional developments are in the pipeline.</p><p>Revenue has also significantly improved its telephone services including the introduction of a new Business Taxes service and consistent opening hours across the telephone services given greater certainty for taxpayers. </p><p>Enhanced online services and improved telephone service has resulted in a reduced demand for the traditional 'walk-in' services to public offices.  The number of personal callers fell by 64% since 2008, from 1.15m callers to approximately 400,000 in 2015.  I am advised by Revenue that taxpayers are choosing different channels to 'walk-in' services and are getting the information and assistance they require in a way that better meets their needs.</p><p>In this regard, Revenue introduced an appointments service in a number of public offices in 2015 and 2016 and will extend this to other offices, including Thurles, in the coming months.  An appointments service provides a further improvement in Revenue's service to taxpayers by eliminating the need for queuing and reduces the time involved for taxpayers.  The move to an appointments service is advised, locally, in advance with notices in the particular Revenue office, other public notices, through local media and on Revenue's website <i><i>www.revenue.ie.</i></i>This will be the case as regards the Thurles office in due course.  </p><p>I am informed by Revenue that they have eighteen public offices around the country.  Staff in these offices are, generally speaking, equipped to deal with the full range of issues raised by taxpayers when they call.  Approximately 75 fulltime equivalent staff are directly involved in the provision of walk-in services in these public offices.  Extra resources are assigned to meet peak period demand during the year.  Details of staff numbers allocated to 'walk-in' services in the last five years are not available.  However, I am advised by Revenue that it is likely that the numbers have reduced in that time due to the changing preferences of customers for online and telephone service channels.</p></reply>

The Act, which was commenced on 21st March 2016, inter alia provides for the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) which was established on the same date.  The legislation has therefore been in operation for less than one year. I understand that Revenue has not identified any issues of concern with the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I further understand that the TAC proposes to undertake a consultative process related to the operation of its Rules of Procedure involving all stakeholders around the first anniversary of the coming into force of the legislation.

I expect that this exercise will provide an opportunity to raise issues about the operation of the reformed tax appeals system including any issues arising that are of relevance to the legislation.

The significant point is that that the focus of regulation is directly at the point of contact with the customer.  Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016. </p><p>I would refer the Deputy to the Central Bank report on mortgage arrears, which was prepared following my request to the Governor.  This report provides a detailed assessment of mortgage arrears in banks and non-bank entities and includes analysis on mortgage restructuring activity and the range of solutions offered.  This report was published on 16th December 2016 and is available on http<i>://www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/publications/reports-research/report-mortgage-arrears-2016</i>.  The report found that the range of mortgage debt solutions offered by banks and non-banks is broadly similar.  </p><p>Finally, I would strongly advise any individual availing of the scheme in question to ensure they seek independent financial/legal advice on the terms and conditions of the offer made and all of its implications for them, prior to the acceptance of such offer.</p></reply>

This credit also provides an entitlement to an additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band.  A single individual with no children is entitled to a standard rate band of &euro;33,800.  An individual in receipt of the SPCCC is entitled to a standard rate band of &euro;37,800.</p>  <p>  The income tax system started moving towards a system of individualisation in 1999, and individualisation is now integral to the overall system.  When first announced, the stated purposes of individualisation were to ease the burden on single persons, including single parents, to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax and more generally to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  Prior to this, a second spouse faced the marginal rate of tax on the first euro (or Punt as it was then) earned in his or her own name.  Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The Home Carer credit was introduced in the context of the move towards individualisation of the tax system, in recognition of the choices made by families where one spouse stays at home to care for children or the elderly. </p>  <p>  The issue of tax individualisation was considered by the Commission on Taxation in 2009 and that body recommended no change should be made to the current system.  It concluded that the current system represents a balance between, on the one hand, acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and, on the other, taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation.</p>  <p>  The composition of households can vary and thus the costs and expenses of households can also vary.  Generally speaking a household of a greater number of individuals will generally have greater outgoings than a household of a lower number of individuals.  I am satisfied that the income tax system provides positive support to the various household compositions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department published an Income Tax Reform Plan, in July last year, providing a detailed overview of relevant policy considerations, including the necessity to maintain the breadth of our income tax base, and retain appropriate levels of taxation for high earners. </p>  <p>  The purpose of this Income Tax Reform Plan was to inform all members of the Oireachtas of the issues and options which will underpin future income tax reform, and it is my hope that all members of the Oireachtas will engage constructively in debating options for future reform in this area.  In this regard the scope for change will be dependent on the level of available fiscal resources.</p></reply>

The information available to the Special Liquidators indicates that the transactions involved the securitisation of loans (including non-Irish loans) to raise cost efficient funding for the then bank's day to day business.  Such securitisation transactions are commonly undertaken by banks around the world to raise funding.  The information available to the Special Liquidators would indicate that the transactions identified were typical of the securitisation transactions generally undertaken by banks and were not of the character targeted by the changes to the Section 110 regime introduced by Finance Act 2016. </p></reply>

The remaining applications are being processed, and any unsuccessful applicants are advised about how to address any issues arising in their application.  Details of the approved contractors are published on the Revenue website. I am advised by Revenue that they have seen a steady increase in the number of applications.  There were 9 applications for registration received in late 2016, 89 in January and 40 in the first two weeks of February.</p>  <p>  I understand that there is a significant volume of queries from contractors about the scheme, and about the information needed to register as a 'qualifying contractor'.  Revenue presented at an information session organised by the Construction Industry Federation in January which was very well attended, and are to present at two further information sessions in Cork and Galway soon.  The steady volume of applications and the level of interest in the scheme are apparent and I do not believe that there is a problem with the incentive.  </p>  <p>  I would also point out that the scheme is still relatively new, and is due to run until the end of 2019.  While there is strong interest in Help To Buy, it is too early to draw any firm conclusions from the data emerging at this stage.</p>  <p>  Regarding retrospective claims, the legislation underpinning the Help To Buy incentive is set out in section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The section distinguishes between refunds made in respect of contracts entered into in the period from 19 July to 31 December 2016 and those in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019.  'Retrospective' first-time buyers are those persons who purchased in the period from when the incentive was announced on 19 July 2016 until the end of 2016 and the legislation provides that any such HTB refunds are paid directly to the claimant's bank account.  HTB refunds for first time buyers of new homes in the period from 2017 onwards, are however, payable to the qualifying contractor's bank account.  I am advised by Revenue that 'retrospective' first-time buyers who claim their HTB refund should have that claim verified by their contractor.  In the event that they cannot get their contractor to verify their claim, they should contact Revenue online via the 'MyEnquiries' facility.</p>  <p>  With regard to the reasons why a contractor may not register for the scheme, I expect that would arise for non-compliant contractors who do not have valid tax clearance and would not be considered compliant for Relevant Contracts Tax purposes.  The HTB scheme provides that the tax credit is payable at deposit stage and in many cases will be paid before the house is built.  I think it is extremely important that the contractor is tax compliant, as non-compliance is a very clear indicator that the contractor may not be financially sound and not in a position to complete the contract.  I strongly encourage any contractor who is non-compliant, and wishes to be registered as a 'qualifying contractor', to contact Revenue with a view to regularising their tax affairs.</p></reply>

I also announced an increase in the limit on contactless payments from &euro;15 to &euro;30 and reformed stamp duty to remove it from debit cards; replacing it with a 12c charge per ATM transaction though with a cap to ensure no consumer would be worse off.</p>  <p>  New service providers which bring innovative safe payment methods and additional consumer choice are to be welcomed.  The decision on whether and when to provide payment services in the Irish market is ultimately a matter for the providers of such services, though I note that one such mobile payment platform entered this market just two months ago and I expect to see others do the same in due course.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-14a.350.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400066#WRF01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 180 to 182, inclusive, and 199 together.</p>  <p>  My Department has overall responsibility for policy development for education and training provision across the economy including the hospitality and tourism sector.  There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.</p>  <p>  The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.</p>  <p>  Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.</p>  <p>  The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the Tourism Insight online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention.</p>  <p>  Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.</p>  <p>  Last month, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity.</p>  <p>  Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.</p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p>  <p>  Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The following table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available.  While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table.</p>  <p>  In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However the table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.</p>  <p>  In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4 million and in 2016 the total number of student for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4 m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.</p>  <p>  This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:</p>  <p>- Tourism/Hotel/Leisure/Event</p>  <p>- Hospitality and Culinary</p>  <p>- Heritage and Cultural.</p>  <p>  I also understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

This determines the level of concentrated disadvantage across the school system and identify those schools which require the greatest level of support.  There is no need for schools to apply for assessment as the data required is already available to the DES.</p><p>As an immediate action under the Plan over 100 additional schools identified with the highest levels of disadvantage will receive extra supports.  Details of these schools are available on my Department's website at.</p><p>The fact that a school has not been included in the programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p><p>The new DEIS school support programme will be implemented from September 2017, with ongoing work with education partners and other stakeholders to ensure successful delivery of its objectives.</p></reply>

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including most importantly possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas.</p>  <p>  I initially allocated 4 weeks for receipt of submissions to the consultation, however, I received a number of representations from stakeholder groups who stand to potentially be impacted by any changes, coming from different sides of the debates involved, as well as from Oireachtas colleagues on different sides of the Houses urging that the time period for the consultation be extended.</p>  <p>  I have also been made aware of the impact of the mid-term break and the need to allow groups who depend on volunteers, such as the boards of management of schools, to have the time to consult their members and communities and submit responses which are properly considered and comprehensive.  I am anxious to facilitate the fullest possible engagement from all stakeholders and I recognise and appreciate the work and commitment of members of boards of management and I value their input in this consultation.</p>  <p>  Consequently, I have announced an extension of the time period for the receipt of written submissions in this consultation process by 4 weeks, meaning that the new deadline is Monday 20 March.  This means that the total time available for written submissions is 8 weeks.</p>  <p>  This phase of receiving written submissions is part of the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps.  These steps will require additional time, and I am conscious of legislative deadlines impacting on this work, in particular the Equal Status (Admissions to Schools Bill) which is due before the House again shortly.</p></reply>

Some of this will undoubtedly be achieved through the lens of the new &lsquo;Creative Ireland&rsquo; initiative, being led by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and the Department of Education and Skills has significant commitments under what is called Pillar One of this initiative.</p>  <p>  From the more specific perspective of History, I am satisfied that there are a number of key supports to the study of 1916.  For one thing, many of the history-specific resources which have been developed for the Ireland 2016 commemorative programme retain a currency as we move further into the Decade of Centenaries.  The supports for teachers, and often generated by teachers, which are provided on the Department&rsquo;s education portal Scoilnet remain available to teachers and students.  So too, the fabulous resources available from the Bureau of Military History, the Letters of 1916 and other repositories, which were partners in the Department&rsquo;s work under Ireland 2016, will continue to be available to students, researchers and teachers as we close in on centenaries of other key years in the emergence of modern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department will also continue its support for the all-island schools history competition, now in its fourth year and with a specific &lsquo;Decade of Centenaries&rsquo; focus.  We are also looking at appropriate ways of archiving the Proclamations for a New Generation, of which over a thousand were developed by schools during 2016.  These are a vivid reminder of the importance of learning from the past in order to reimagine and improve modern Ireland too.</p>  <p>  A full revision of the History specification is now underway at the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  It is expected that this review will produce a draft specification, for public comment, in the first half of 2017, and that both the events of 100 years ago, and the skills that students need to interpret and understand them, will form key elements of the eventual specification.  The new specification is scheduled for implementation in the autumn of 2018.</p></reply>

SCPA is utilised, in the main, where as yet unfilled vacancies exist in NEPS staffing provision locally or where staffing resource is lost through extended leave (maternity, sick or carer&rsquo;s leave). </p><p>I attach for the Deputy&rsquo;s information a list of some 93 schools in County Cork who currently derive this service through the abovementioned SCPA scheme rather than through a NEPS psychologist. In the case of these schools, NEPs psychologists may no longer be assigned to those schools as a result of retirement, resignation or transfer to another NEPs region.  </p><p>The Public Appointments Service (PAS) maintain regional recruitment panels of qualified personnel to fill these vacancies.  During 2016, despite my Department's best efforts the panels did not produce recruits for NEPS in relation to all vacancies, the panels were therefore closed.</p><p>A new national recruitment competition was put in place last Autumn by PAS to fill all vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The resulting interview process associated with this competition was completed last week and recruitment panels for each NEPS region, including Cork, will now be formed.  PAS will finalise the processing of the candidates, including Garda vetting, and propose each candidate in series to my Department Human Resources Section for contract negotiations and formal job offer.</p><p>It is envisaged that the process will produce new NEPS psychologists for assignment to schools, including that to which the Deputy refers in his question, by the end of the current academic year.  However it is important to point out that in cases where NEPS service is not available through staffing vacancy or temporary absence of staff, as described above, the schools affected continue to have access to a psychologist through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments to undertake pupil assessment work.</p><p>I would also confirm that all schools are able to access full NEP supports in the event of a critical incident irrespective of their having ongoing access to an assigned NEPS psychologist or not.</p><p>List of Cork City and County Schools who do not currently have

In the case of these schools, NEPs psychologists may no longer be assigned to those schools as a result of retirement, resignation or transfer to another NEPs region.  </p><p>Cork is part of the NEPS Mid-Munster Region comprising two offices (Cork and Clonmel) providing service to schools in Cork City &amp;amp; County and South Tipperary.  The Cork office providing service in the main to Cork City and County schools has a staffing complement of 21 psychologists (18.9 whole-time equivalents).  Currently three vacancies exist in this office. </p><p>A new national recruitment competition was put in place last Autumn by PAS to fill all vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The resulting interview process associated with this competition was recently completed and recruitment panels for each NEPS region, including Cork, will now be formed.  PAS will finalise the processing of the candidates, including Garda vetting, and propose each candidate in series to my Department Human Resources Section for contract negotiations and formal job offer.</p><p>Currently in relation to the Cork Office it is planned that one vacancy, and recruited from the end of the old panel, will be filled shortly.  Another will be filled through a transfer of a psychologist from another NEPS Region upon completion of her maternity leave.  The third vacancy will be fill from the new panel described above. It is  envisaged that all three should be in place by the end of the current academic year.  </p><p>However it is important to point out that in cases where NEPS service is not available through staffing vacancy or temporary absence of staff, as described above, the schools affected continue to have access to a psychologist through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments to undertake pupil assessment work.</p><p>I would also confirm that all schools continue to be able to  access full NEP supports in the event of a critical incident irrespective of their having ongoing access to an assigned NEPS psychologist or not.</p><p><b>List of Cork City and County Schools who do not currently have access to a NEPS Psychologist to undertake pupils assessment but who have instead access to the SCPA Scheme for this purpose.</b></p><p><b>10/02/2017</b><table><tr><th><b>Roll No.</b></th><th><b>TYPE</b></th><th><b>Region</b></th><th><b>County</b></th><th><b>School</b></th><th><b>Address 1</b></th><th><b>Address 2</b></th><th><b>Address 3</b></th><th><b>Address 4</b></th></tr><tr><td>12263B</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>GOGGINSHILL N S</td><td>BALLINHASSIG</td><td>CO CORK</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12473M</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>GREENMOUNT MONASTERY NS</td><td>SCOIL MUIRE NA NGRAS</td><td>GREENMOUNT</td><td>CO CORK</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>13980L</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>S N B TOGHER CORK</td><td>TOGHER</td><td>CORK</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>14433K</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>ABBEYSTREWRY N S</td><td>SKIBBEREEN</td><td>CO CORK</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16746S</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>BALLYGARVAN N S</td><td>BALLYGARVAN</td><td>CO CORK</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>17323S</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>MONKSTOWN N S</td><td>MONKSTOWN</td><td>CO CORK</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20088F</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>SCOIL MHUIRE N.S.,</td><td>SCHULL</td><td>CO CORK</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20105C</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>STAR OF THE SEA PRIMARY SCHOOL</td><td>PASSAGE WEST</td><td>CO CORK</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20335T</td><td>Primary</td><td>Mid-Munster</td><td>Cork</td><td>Scoil Phadraig Naofa</td><td>Foxwood</td><td>Rochestown</td><td></td><td>Co.

I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.</p>  <p>  Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle is ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle going forward. </p>  <p>  Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools.  Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle. </p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History.  History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past.  History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.</p>  <p>  I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA.  This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which over 200 submissions were received.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.</p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts about 25% of the total cohort of students.  The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.</p>  <p>  In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them. </p>  <p>  The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously. </p>  <p>  This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  Those very skills, and attitudes, can indeed be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of history, news and current affairs too. </p></reply>

This is contributing to what we know is already a considerable strain on some students and their families to participate in higher education with knock-on effects on completion rates.  The reality is that dealing comprehensively with this issue will only take place as part of a more general programme to address the major housing and homelessness issue.</p><p>Accordingly, my colleague Mr. Simon Coveney T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, on 19 July 2016 published &ldquo;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rdquo;, following Government approval of this comprehensive and ambitious Plan.  The full plan can be accessed at: </p><p>My Department worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in developing this Plan, with a specific focus on student accommodation, and I very much welcome the commitments contained in the plan and I look forward to working with colleagues on a cross-Departmental basis to ensure that the commitments contained in the Plan are implemented as soon as practicable.</p><p>As outlined in the Action Plan for Education 2017 and in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan, my officials have been working closely with officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with other relevant stakeholders with a view to implementing all of the relevant actions in relation to student accommodation that were detailed in Rebuilding Ireland.  Under the Action Plan for Education 2017, we will publish a national student accommodation strategy which will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of student accommodation.</p><p>In addition to this an inter-departmental steering group on student accommodation has been established which is chaired by the Deputy Secretary General of my Department.  This steering group is comprised of officials from my Department in addition to representatives from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority, the Irish Universities Association, the Technological Higher Education Association, the Union of Students in Ireland, the University of Limerick, Trinity College Dublin and the National Treasury Management Agency.

Where teachers have questions as to the benefits of membership of a particular union, those questions should be addressed to the relevant union.</p><p>The current position is that the Lansdowne Road Agreement as set out in Section 2 of Circular 0045/2016 applies to teachers employed in Designated Community Colleges, Community and Comprehensive Schools and Voluntary Secondary Schools who are TUI members.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2013 and 2015 as set out in Section 3 of the Circular applies to all other teachers employed in such schools.  The circular is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed at:</p><p>In addition, a comprehensive FAQ document is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website:</p><p>As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p><p>Accordingly, there is no proposal at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.  However, since the announcement of the ASTI ballot result my Department has received a number of queries from both ASTI members and teachers who are not members of a trade union about union membership.  Therefore, having regard to the circumstances of the dispute with the ASTI, this is an issue that I will keep under review going forward.</p></reply>

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including most importantly possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. </p>  <p>  I initially allocated 4 weeks for receipt of submissions to the consultation, however, I received a number of representations from stakeholder groups who stand to potentially be impacted by any changes, coming from different sides of the debates involved, as well as from Oireachtas colleagues on different sides of the Houses urging that the time period for the consultation be extended.</p>  <p>  I have also been made aware of the impact of the mid-term break and the need to allow groups who depend on volunteers, such as the boards of management of schools, to have the time to consult their members and communities and submit responses which are properly considered and comprehensive.  I am anxious to facilitate the fullest possible engagement from all stakeholders and I recognise and appreciate the work and commitment of members of boards of management and I value their input in this consultation.</p>  <p>  Consequently, I have announced an extension of the time period for the receipt of written submissions in this consultation process by 4 weeks, meaning that the new deadline is Monday 20 March. This means that the total time available for written submissions is 8 weeks. </p>  <p>  This phase of receiving written submissions is part of the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps. These steps will require additional time, and I am conscious of legislative deadlines impacting on this work, in particular the Equal Status (Admissions to Schools Bill) which is due before the House again shortly.</p></reply>

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.</p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that. There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs my Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school. Following patronage processes, which give significant weight to parental demand, the vast majority of new schools which are established come under multi-denominational patronage. In 2016, seven new multi-denominational post-primary schools opened, with a further five opening in September 2017.  Five new multi-denominational primary schools opened in 2016. Three new primary schools will open in September 2017 and the patronage process for these schools is currently underway.       </p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p><p>Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for the preparation of a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  Among the measures being considered for the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support, inter alia, urban regeneration and rural development.</p><p>The Government recently launched <i>Realising Our Rural Potential: The Action Plan for Rural Development,</i>lead responsibility for which rests with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Plan is aimed at delivering real change for people living and working in rural Ireland and includes a specific action to determine the feasibility of enabling local authorities to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support rural development policy objectives.

The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are as set out in the following regulations - the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012- available at: www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/si/408/made/en/print.   </p>  <p>  The credit policy which sets out the terms and conditions for the making of loans under these regulations stipulates that the primary earner on the application must have at least two years continuous employment (this can be self-employment).  This requirement does not mean that the employment must be with the same employer but rather that there should be no break in employment for at least two years.</p>  <p>  I would advise prospective house purchase loan applicants to contact their relevant local authority for further information in relation to the loan products available and the terms and conditions that prevail.</p></reply>

The total budget for the new scheme for 2017 is &euro;4.5 million.  Proposals relating to the structure and delivery of the new programme are currently being finalised.</p><p>The <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>also gave a commitment to develop a new Community Development Scheme in 2017, which has evolved into the Communities Facilities Scheme.  Similar to the RAPID scheme, the funding is for small scale capital projects only but in addition to targeting disadvantaged urban areas, it also covers disadvantaged rural areas.  The total budget for the new scheme for 2017 is &euro;2 million.</p><p>The new Repair and Leasing Scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow on a pilot basis in October 2016.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is workable from the perspectives of local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies ((AHBs) respectively prior to the scheme being rolled out nationally.  It is anticipated that approximately 3,500 units will be secured for social housing through the scheme over the period 2017-2021.  A budget of &euro;6m has been provided for 2017 to cover the refurbishment costs of 150 units, with a total budget of &euro;140m being provided over the lifetime of the scheme.  I am currently considering the scope to accelerate further the rollout of this scheme.</p><p>The Buy and Renew Initiative is aimed at facilitating local authorities to purchase and renew housing units in need of remediation and make them available for social housing use.  &euro;25m funding has been provided for the scheme for 2017.  The details of the scheme are expected to be announced shortly.</p><p>The Social Housing Capital Investment Programme spans a range of Exchequer funded and local authority funded programmes and initiatives designed to maintain and improve the existing local authority housing stock of over 130,000 units.  This programme includes an ambitious regeneration programme, funding for remedial works projects as well as for the provision of extensions, improvement works in lieu of local authority housing and improvements to accommodate tenants with disabilities.</p><p>The regeneration projects being funded by my Department under this Programme target the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities, including those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, unemployment and anti-social behaviour.  The Department currently supports a programme of large-scale regeneration projects in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and smaller-scale projects in Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.  These projects seek to address the causes of disadvantage in these communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  The total budgetary provision for the estates regeneration programme for 2017 is &euro;97.787m.</p></reply>

For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001.  There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p>  <p>  Following the enactment of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, the Housing Agency reviewed the rental markets in certain counties nationally and identified nine housing authorities containing electoral areas that could potentially be Rent Pressure Zones.  The Housing Agency consulted with the relevant housing authorities regarding their views on the rental markets, including housing demand and supply, and their experiences in relation to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), trends in relation to both general housing needs and homelessness and other relevant issues.   </p>  <p>  On 24 January 2017 the Housing Agency proposed that 15 Local Electoral Areas in the following five housing authority areas should be considered for designation: Cork County, Galway City, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  On foot of the proposal from the Housing Agency, and in accordance with section 24A(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), I requested the Director of the RTB to make a report to me as to whether these areas met the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones.</p>  <p>  On 26 January 2017, I received a report from the RTB confirming that 12 out of the 15 Local Electoral Areas examined met the criteria.  As required by section 24A(5) of the Act, I made Orders designating the 12 Rent Pressure Zones on 26 January 2017.  The Orders came into effect on 27 January 2017.  Details of the areas that met the criteria and have been designated as Rent Pressure Zones are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/private-rented-housing/coveney-designates-new-rent-pressure-zones.</p>  <p>  The Local Electoral Areas of Cobh, Maynooth and Greystones were found not to meet the criteria.  The reports received from the RTB in relation to the designation of rent pressure zones, including a table showing the results of the analysis carried out on the 15 proposed areas for designation, are available on the website of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) at www.rtb.ie/rentzones.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, I have no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as Rent Pressure Zones or in deciding whether they should be designated.  The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.  Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016 on a pilot basis and my Department is currently working with local authorities to prepare for the wider national rollout of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. </p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.</p>  <p>  A scheme of this nature will require both significant capital and current exchequer investment expenditure over the next 5 years and therefore must be properly analysed and assessed to ensure the best use of public money.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is appropriately modelled from a financial perspective but also, and critically, that it is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives and delivers high quality social housing effectively.   </p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency, who are assisting with implementation of the scheme, are in regular contact with the two pilot local authorities and I understand that the pilot is progressing well at a local level.  In parallel, my Department is working with local authorities to prepare for the rollout of the scheme.  This includes assisting with access to public sources of data relating to vacant property, as well as facilitating local cooperation between AHBs and LAs on how the scheme will operate on the ground for interested property owners.</p>  <p>  Several AHBs are working together with the Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas and, as the scheme becomes available nationally, I expect that more AHBs will become involved in the roll out of the scheme.  AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I have committed to making &euro;140m available over that period.  While the current target for 2017 is 150 units, the interest expressed by property owners and stakeholders so far indicates that the 2017 targets will be achieved and could potentially be exceeded following national rollout.  Taking account of this, the capacity of local authorities and AHBs to deliver under the scheme, as well as the necessary agreement on the financial considerations arising, I am exploring how delivery under the new scheme might be accelerated.</p>  <p>  I would encourage any local authority that is eager to engage early with the scheme to liaise with the pilot local authorities and my Department, in order to be familiar with the requirements around participation and also the practical implementation issues that are being worked through with the pilot scheme. </p></reply>

To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to such sites, including to:</p><p>- establish and maintain a register of derelict sites in their functional area,</p><p>- require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site,</p><p>- impose a levy on sites which are included in their derelict sites register, and</p><p>- acquire derelict site s by agreement or compulsorily.</p><p>I am informed that Kildare County Council does not have property owned by Waterways Ireland included in its Derelict Sites Register.

On foot of the proposal from the Housing Agency, and in accordance with section 24A(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), I requested the Director of the RTB to make a report to me as to whether these areas met the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones. </p>  <p>  On 26 January 2017, I received a report from the RTB confirming that 12 out of the 15 Local Electoral A reas examined met the criteria.  As required by section 24A(5) of the Act, I made Orders designating the 12 Rent Pressure Zones on 26 January 2017.  The Orders came into effect on 27 January 2017.  Details of the areas that met the criteria and have been designated as Rent Pressure Zones are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/private-rented-housing/coveney-designates-new-rent-pressure-zones.</p>  <p>  The Local Electoral Are as of Cobh, Maynooth and Greystones were found not to meet the criteria.  Clane and Kilcock are part of the electoral area of Maynooth and therefore do not meet the criteria to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.  Kill, however, is part of the electoral area of Naas, which has been designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.  The reports received from the RTB in relation to the designation of rent pressure zones, including a table showing the results of the analysis carried out on the 15 proposed areas for designation, are available on the website of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) at the following link: www.rtb.ie/docs/default-source/rent-pressure-zones/summary-results-table.pdf?sfvrsn=2. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, I have no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as Rent Pressure Zones or in deciding whether they should be designated.  The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.  Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

Of these, 2,723 were ineligible or terminated during the process, 217 have been completed with 635 being actively progressed.  The reasons why a case has not progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.</p><p>Statistical information relating to the MTR scheme since its inception, including statistics on cases that have been terminated and the reasons for same, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at the following web link: <i></i>.</p><p>A number of amendments were made to the MTR scheme in July 2015 to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers.</p><p>Notwithstanding the amendments already made, the Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes.  A Review of the Mortgage to Rent Scheme was published on 8 February 2017 and represents the completion of an early action in the Government&rsquo;s <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.  The Review is available from the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:<i></i>.</p><p>The Review has explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommends a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  Key actions include:</p><p>- Lenders will be required to formally communicate with borrowers as to why they are not suitable for the scheme.</p><p>- The property price threshold for a house in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow is being increased to &euro;365,000 (from &euro;350,000) while the threshold for an apartment/townhouse in these areas is being increased to &euro;310,000 (from &euro;300,000).  For the rest of the country, the threshold for a house is being increased to &euro;280,000 (from &euro;250,000) and for an apartment / townhouse to &euro;210,000 (&euro;190,000).</p><p>- Flexibility will be provided in relation to the size of properties which qualify for the scheme.  In practical terms, this means that an assessment of the property size suitable to a particular household will allow for a maximum of two additional bedrooms in the property above the actual needs of the household, with the property still being considered eligible.</p><p>- There are a number of actions to improve knowledge and understanding of the scheme.  A range of state agencies will be facilitated to assist and guide borrowers who could benefit from the scheme.  A Step by Step Guide for Borrowers will be produced alongside a range of other targeted information supports.</p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the actions put forward in the Review will make the MTR process quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately, more accessible to more households in mortgages distress.</p><p>In addition, the Review concludes that the current financial model of the scheme may not be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  Currently, the MTR scheme relies on AHBs to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.  A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home.</p><p>One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.</p><p>A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.</p></reply>

A household may apply for support to one housing authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or the authority that agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  In determining whether a household has a local connection with its area, a housing authority must have regard to whether a household member:</p>  <p>- lived in the area for a continuous 5 year period at any time in the past,</p>  <p>- is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area,</p>  <p>- is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area, or</p>  <p>- has a relative (defined in the Regulations) living in the area for 2 years or longer.   </p>  <p>  The flexibility of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme as a form of social housing support is one of the scheme&rsquo;s key elements and an important benefit envisaged for many households with a housing need.  The movement of households, within a local authority area, for the purposes of employment, further education or other reasonable reasons is facilitated for households under the scheme, while retaining HAP support.  The phased implementation of the HAP pilot scheme has afforded my Department an opportunity for learning and it is in this context that the need for greater ease in the provision of flexibility of movement of HAP households between local authority areas has been identified.  The movement of HAP supported households between neighbouring local authority areas has been facilitated to date in a small number of cases. </p>  <p>  This matter is under consideration and the options to facilitate such movements, while remaining cognisant of the Ministerial Direction in relation to transfers to other forms of social housing, are being explored within my Department with input from all local authorities.   </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

This has been spread across the areas of technical analysis and research, public consultation and communications.  As indicated in replies to previous Questions, the development of the Framework, one of the most strategically important public policy exercises currently under way by the Government, will be a collaborative exercise, the ultimate success of which will depend on the degree to which all citizens have the opportunity to have their say on how Ireland should develop over the next twenty years or more, and how we can plan for and accommodate the substantial additional population expected by 2040 in a more strategic and sustainable way. </p><p>In this regard a number of initiatives have been put in place aimed at maintaining and updating the information flow and providing a forum or point of contact for feedback, where needed.  For example, a dedicated website, <i><font color="#2F2F2F">www.npf.ie</font></i>, has been put in place and a dedicated email address, npf@housing.gov.ie has also been created. </p><p>In addition to the standard provision of textual and graphic information to view and download, the website facilitates engagement with the general public through the use of easy to understand video presentations and social media which will be used and re-used throughout the process bringing down costs.  Total expenditure to date in these areas, including promotional material, graphic design and video, is &euro;37,132.  The website will be one of the main platforms for ensuring the public can keep up to date over the life of the plan and is a long-term investment. </p><p>A public consultation strategy, &lsquo;Ireland 2040 &ndash; Our Plan&rsquo; (National Planning Framework), is currently under way and will run to the middle of March, the outcome of which will feed into further analysis and robust evidence-based policy in formulating a draft Framework by the Summer.  A first round of preliminary consultations with key stakeholders was undertaken in June of last year, and a report on the consultation has been prepared.  Venue and streaming costs to date on this total &euro;10,072. </p><p>In relation to research, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) is currently working with my Department on NPF relevant research and empirical evidence.  This work includes developing an &ldquo;economic model and baseline&rdquo; scenario, considering a range of future development options, including a &ldquo;business-as-usual&rdquo; scenario.  To date &euro;60,000 has been paid to the ESRI in relation to this key area of research, which will be of benefit across a range of Departments and will help inform plan making at the regional level. </p><p>External experts on environmental assessments required under EU law have been appointed to carry out technical analyses including a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), an Appropriate Assessment under the Habitats Directives (AA) and a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA).  An environmental scoping report is currently being prepared and will inform the pre-draft consultation process.  Expenditure incurred on this work to date amounts to &euro;24,475. </p><p>Further information in relation to Ireland 2040- Our Plan: National Planning Framework<i></i>is available on the<i>www.npf.ie</i>website.

Monthly HAP payments are made directly to landlords on behalf of tenants in respect of rent, subject to rent limits and conditions of the scheme.  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority.

The Review is available from the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:<i></i>.</p><p>The Review has explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommends a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers. </p><p>Key actions include:</p><p>- Lenders will be required to formally communicate with borrowers as to why they are not suitable for the scheme.</p><p>- The property price threshold for a house in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow is being increased to &euro;365,000 (from &euro;350,000) while the threshold for an apartment/townhouse in these areas is being increased to &euro;310,000 (from &euro;300,000).  For the rest of the country, the threshold for a house is being increased to &euro;280,000 (from &euro;250,000) and for an apartment/townhouse to &euro;210,000 (&euro;190,000).</p><p>- Flexibility will be provided in relation to the size of properties which qualify for the scheme.  In practical terms, this means that an assessment of the property size suitable to a particular household will allow for a maximum of two additional bedrooms in the property above the actual needs of the household, with the property still being considered eligible.</p><p>- There are a number of actions to improve knowledge and understanding of the scheme.  A range of state agencies will be facilitated to assist and guide borrowers who could benefit from the scheme.  A Step by Step Guide for Borrowers will be produced alongside a range of other targeted information supports. </p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the actions put forward in the Review will make the MTR process quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately, more accessible to more households in mortgages distress. </p><p>In addition, the Review concludes that the current financial model of the scheme may not be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  Currently, the MTR scheme relies on Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.  A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm's ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home. </p><p>One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.</p><p>A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.</p></reply>

The final roll-out of HAP will be completed with the introduction of the scheme to Dublin City Council, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council areas from 1 March, 2017.   </p>  <p>  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) is also managing a HAP Homeless Pilot for the four Dublin local authorities.  The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015.  The focus of this pilot remains the transitioning of qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  To qualify for HAP under the homeless pilot scheme, a household must generally be accepted as homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988 by one of the four Dublin local authorities.  The Homeless HAP support has also been used to prevent households from entering homelessness and homeless services.   </p>  <p>  While eligible homeless households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Place-Finder Service, has also been established to engage directly with property-owners and support qualified households to find suitable tenancies and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place.  This is a particularly important service for households currently residing in emergency accommodation in the Dublin region.  The costs of supporting these households and of the Dublin Place-Finder Service are funded through several funding streams across my Department, the Department of Social Protection and Dublin City Council. </p>  <p>  The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer moneys and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies.  The provisional Exchequer outturn for the HAP scheme in 2016 was in excess of &euro;57 million.  This funding supported both the ongoing costs of tenancies established in 2015 that continued into 2016, and the costs of the 12,075 additional households supported by the scheme nationally in 2016.  Some &euro;14 million of these costs related to tenancies established in the four Dublin local authority areas.  1,791 of these additional tenancies were established in the four Dublin local authority areas in 2016.  Budget 2017 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;152.7 million in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households and the costs of supporting an additional 15,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2017. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am very satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-14a.623.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400070#WRK01300"><p>The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2015 shows that the consistent poverty rate for lone parent households is 26.2%, up from 25% in 2014.  The deprivation rate for lone parent households fell from 58.7 per cent in 2014 to 57.9% in 2015.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parent households is largely unchanged in 2015 at 36.2%, compared to 36.5% in 2014.  The data also shows that the consistent poverty rate for children fell from 12.7% in 2014 to 11.5% in 2015.</p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these 2015 figures.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.5% in mid-2015 to 7.1% in January 2017.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports continues to fall.  The full impact of the reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) and the positive impact of recent Budgets on lone parents are also not reflected in these figures. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 lone parents benefitted from a number of measures including increases in child benefit, changes to the means test on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment to align it with the more generous means test on the one-parent family payment, and increases in the family income supplement thresholds.  In Budget 2017 all lone parents on OFP, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for OFP and JST have risen by &euro;20 from January this year, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  During that time the national minimum wage was increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.25 per hour.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2017 showed that average household incomes increase by 1%.  Non-earning lone parents were the biggest beneficiary of Budget 2017 with gains of 4.5%.  Working lone parents also experienced above average gains at almost 1.2%.  This represents a cumulative increase across Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 almost &euro;27 per week for working lone parents and of over &euro;24 per week for lone parents who are not working.  </p>  <p>  One of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will significantly reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.</p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Meeting this target means lifting 102,000 children out of poverty.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.</p>  <p>  Eurostat data shows that social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 34.9% to 16.9%, an absolute reduction of 18 percentage points.  In relative terms, this represents a poverty reduction effect of 52%.  Ireland continues to be consistently among the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers.  But we also know that, reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  It is also about supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas such as activation including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.</p>  <p>  As part of the OFP reforms the Department has begun engaging with lone parents whose youngest child is seven years and older, on a proactive and supported basis.  To date over 9,000 lone parents, of the 14,500 lone parents who are on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, have been selected for engagement.  It will take time to see the full impact of these activation engagements as it will take time for lone parents to complete the education, training or employment support programmes.</p>  <p>  Initial indicative data from the latest Quarterly National Household Survey also shows that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of lone parents in employment in the year since the end of June 2016.  This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally.  The magnitude of the increase for lone parents specifically, however, is clearly significant.</p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with the actions outlined above will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.  The independent review of the one-parent family payment reforms, once completed, will also assist with discussions in my Department on measures for lone parents in Budget 2018.</p></reply>

Given that this approach is very specific to an individual company&rsquo;s operation, these arrangements do not lend themselves to direct comparisons between operators.  It is open to any of the private operators in the free travel scheme to apply for a review of their rate of payment and the operator will then be asked to complete a six month survey of passenger numbers.</p><p>The payment to private operators participating in the free travel scheme in 2016 was &euro;8.5m. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Credits are awarded in circumstances such as unemployment or illness, and their purpose is to help protect the social insurance entitlements of insured persons by covering gaps in insurance during periods when they may not be in a position to pay contributions.</p>  <p>  Credits do not, on their own, give an individual entitlement to social insurance benefits.  They may, however, assist insured workers to qualify for various benefits.  While the contribution conditions applying to the various social insurance schemes can vary, a claimant must, in general have:</p>  <p>  (a) paid a minimum number of weekly contributions, and</p>  <p>  (b) a certain number of contributions or credits over a specified period.  For short term benefits, the number of contributions or credits relates to the relevant tax year.

The two main principles guiding the development of the Working Family Payment are to make work pay and to reduce child poverty. </p>  <p>  This analysis is supplemented by research from the ESRI, which shows that people are better off in work than on welfare.  The ESRI research, based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits and taxes, demonstrates that more than eight out of ten unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least 40 per cent upon taking up employment.  Fewer than 3 per cent would, in the short-term, be financially better off not in work. </p>  <p>  The risk of facing weak financial incentives to work is higher for unemployed persons with a spouse and children, as the income support goal of the welfare system means that they tend to have higher welfare payments.  However, even among that group, less than 1 in 15 would be financially better off not working.  With the addition of the Back to Work Family Dividend, that figure drops to one in twenty.</p>  <p>  Regarding people with disabilities, the Make Work Pay interDepartmental group was established to address strategic priority 3 of the Government's Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities.  The Group is considering the complex interaction of the benefit system, including the Medical Card, the additional costs of work associated with disability, and the net income gains in employment, and is examining recommendations to address issues identified.</p></reply>

This is now in legislation.

However, I can confirm that my Department is liaising with the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) on the most efficient way forward.  On their advice an outline of the Request for Tender (RFT) was issued in December 2016 to potential providers seeking expressions of interest by 11th January 2017.  The responses received confirmed that the RFT can issue under an existing OGP framework, which is the most efficient and quickest way of procuring this evaluation. </p>  <p>  The drafting of the RFT is well underway within my Department.  It is critical that the RFT fully reflects the nature and scope of the report required and so it is important to dedicate the necessary time and effort to this step.

In 2015, incomes rose by 6.2% mainly due to rising employment, the deprivation rate fell for the second year running, and 13,000 children were lifted out of consistent poverty.  Ireland was more equal in terms of the income distribution than at any time this decade. </p>  <p>  However, the results also show that we have a long way to go to achieve the national social target for poverty reduction.  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show further improvement.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals. </p>  <p>  The Survey indicates that the consistent poverty rate, for people in households headed by a person who was unable to work due to illness or a disability, was 22.4% in 2015.  This compared to 14.4% the year before.  However, this figure (like other statistics for very small groups in the survey) has been volatile in recent years.  This is due to smaller sample sizes.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether the change over the year is statistically significant and indicative of a sustained trend.  It is worth noting, moreover, that there was no change if the level of deprivation reported for this group of households in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Adaption Grant Scheme.</p></reply>

For example, although it enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type and location, it wasn&rsquo;t possible for employers to search for suitable jobseekers on the site &ndash; they had to rely on candidates finding and applying for a job from among the many thousands hosted on the system. </p><p>Accordingly, the Department issued a tender for the development and implementation of a new service that would enable both employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skillsets as well as the traditional job-type classifications.  As part of the new service, candidate profiles are automatically matched to job specifications posted by employers. Candidates can use the site to apply for the jobs advertised.  The system will also integrate with the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo service.</p><p>Following the procurement process, the contract was awarded to a firm that is now building and delivering the new service.  The new service was introduced on a phased basis on 28th July 2016.  Since then employers have access to a wide variety of features including the creation and advertising of vacancies, and the ability to search for candidates who meet the specified requirements.  Anybody who logs onto the site can view the vacancies and can apply for them online once they register.  There are currently over 3,200 vacancies advertised on the site.</p><p>As the service is being implemented on phased basis, this unfortunately results in some service disruption while work is ongoing.  Every effort is made to minimise the impact on users.  There have also been some teething problems with the first phase implementation, particularly in relation to performance, but these have largely been resolved.  My Department continues to work with the supplier to resolve all outstanding issues and add additional functionality on an agreed phased basis. </p><p>I am aware of complaints from sponsors about the filling of CE vacancies, but am assured by my officials that there is no problem posting vacancies on JobsIreland.  The process of posting vacancies is relatively straightforward and a tailored video is available online to assist sponsors.  There are currently over 1,200 CE vacancies advertised on the site.  These are visible to anyone who logs onto the site and users can narrow the search by location. </p><p>CE vacancies cannot be applied for online as they are only available to jobseekers who meet the eligibility criteria.  Enhancements are planned to clearly denote this up front on the advertisement.  Referrals are made by case officers.  The referral process will be greatly facilitated following the planned integration of JobsIreland with my Department&rsquo;s Activation Case Management System. </p><p>My Department apologises to users for any inconvenience caused pending full implementation of the new Jobsireland service.  It will ultimately to give them a much better service than the original website.  Anyone experiencing difficulties with the website can contact the National Contact Centre on 1890 800 024 or email for assistance. </p><p>It is reasonable to assume that the difficulties in filling CE vacancies are also related to the significant drop in the Live Register arising from the much improved labour market.  Any sponsor who has any recruitment concerns should contact the nearest Intreo Centre which will be happy to help.</p></reply>

The activation supports and services which are available to those who are long term unemployed include JobPath, Community Employment Scheme (CE) and T&Uacute;S.  The JobPath service procured by the Department provides additional resources to enable it to provide a high quality, case managed employment support service for people who are long term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>  Following a public procurement process, two preferred tenderers were selected.  Turas Nua Ltd. and Seetec Ltd. Turas Nua provide the service in the southern half of the country and Seetec in the northern half of the country.</p>  <p>  The aim of the JobPath service is to assist such Jobseekers to obtain and sustain full time paid employment.  The Community Employment scheme provides part time employment opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments including those on long term unemployment payments; it does not provide full-time sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  Jobseekers can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time; this is to ensure that the best use is made of the available places and to allow the scheme and service providers&rsquo; time to work with the participants.  However, in a small number of exceptional cases, which are assessed on a case by case basis, my Department may facilitate a person to move from one activation support to another. </p>  <p>  The JobPath service is provided for jobseekers only, the referral period is typically for a year and when engaging with the JobPath service, they remain on their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment and on the live register until such time as they are successful in finding employment.  During that time they receive intensive personal support to find a sustainable full time job.  At the end of the 52 weeks, Jobseekers who have not been successful in finding suitable employment may, subject to an assessment by an Intreo case officer, apply for other activation supports such as CE. </p>  <p>  Under the contracts for the provision of the service, there are strict obligations placed on the providers by the Department with regard to data protection, including that data cannot be shared with third parties.  Both companies are also contractually required to register with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and are subject to the same provisions of data protection legislation as Departmental staff.  Data protection legislation requires that personal data shall be kept only for one or more specified and lawful purposes and that personal data shall be used and disclosed only in ways compatible with these purposes.  Any breach or suspected breach of the data protection legislation, in addition to being investigated by the Department, will also be a matter for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In fact most employers that currently have a defined benefit scheme also operate a parallel defined contribution scheme.   </p>  <p>  Neither I as Minister for Social Protection nor the Pensions Authority are empowered under legislation to interfere either in the scenario of a defined benefit scheme being wound up or to compel an employer to make pension contributions to a scheme.  Occupational pension schemes are generally set up under trust and are contributed to by an employer on a voluntary basis.  In almost all Irish defined benefit schemes employers are not prohibited from ceasing contributions, usually after a notice period.   </p>  <p>  It has to be said that many employers have made great efforts to support their pension schemes and have tried to make good the promises made to scheme members.  Of course there are employers who have not.</p>  <p>  Sometimes sponsoring employers can no longer afford to pay for the level of pensions expected by members of defined benefit schemes.  In some cases defined benefit schemes have been frozen and employers have opened up defined contribution schemes for their employees.  They continue to pay into these schemes for their employees.</p>  <p>  This process is usually managed through dialogue and negotiation between employers, employee representatives, trustees and members.  Enhanced transfer values may be offered to encourage members to move to defined contribution schemes. </p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this position is not unique to Ireland.  In the UK 85% of defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.</p>  <p>  The introduction of increased employer obligations has recently been generating much discussion but it should be remembered that such unilateral modifications to a sector could yield unwanted side effects.  Any changes to the Pensions Act that legislatively alters the relationship between a pension scheme and its sponsoring employer could have far-reaching implications for pensioners and the pension sector as a whole, as well as the employers.  These could include prompting well-funded schemes to wind up to avoid new obligations; threatening a company&rsquo;s financial stability; rendering some employers insolvent; and/or giving a competitive advantage to employers who either never provided a pension and/or put defined contribution schemes in place. </p>  <p>  My Department and I are not just keeping a watching brief on the defined benefit sector but are very much involved in the development of proposals for the reform of pensions within the current economic climate. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The rental accommodation scheme (RAS) which continues its operations has during the same period transferred approximately 5,800 households from rent supplement, of which 2,800 were transferred to traditional local authority social housing stock, with the remainder transferred to private landlord or voluntary housing arrangements.</p>  <p>  In addition with the on-going transfer of long term rent supplement cases to local authority sponsored solutions, rent supplement&rsquo;s recipient numbers also reflect the overall decline in the live register numbers for the period under review.  As at January 2015 there were 360,200 persons on the live register, as at January 2017 there are some 278,600 persons, representing a 23% decline during the two year period.  The continuing improvement in the economy means less people seeking support due to temporary unemployment and more exiting the scheme securing employment.</p>  <p>  Statistics are not generally maintained for those exiting the rent supplement scheme, i.e., those entering homeless; moving in with family members; and those no longer requiring social housing support.  In view of the on-going supply side difficulties within the housing market, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent supplement maximum limits.  Since the introduction of this flexible approach, in excess of 11,000 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the increased rental limits introduced in July 2016 and on-going transfers to the HAP scheme, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the appropriate maximum limit ensuring where possible that tenants can remain in their homes. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A robust external evaluation of the scheme recommended that it should be replaced with a new work experience programme that is better suited to the much-improved labour market and addresses some criticisms of the current scheme.</p><p>JobBridge was closed to new applications from 27 October 2016 to allow for a period of consultation with key stakeholders on design principles for a proposed new work experience programme and to facilitate an orderly wind down of the current scheme.  The consultation process is well underway and I expect my officials to report back to me shortly on the outcome.</p><p>In the meantime, employers who wish to offer work experience opportunities are welcome participate in the First Steps programme.  This is a variant of JobBridge targeted at young jobseekers who face barriers to employment.

The implementation of restructured governance arrangements, on completion of this process, will not result in any diminution of locally-provided services, nor in the closure of any service delivery locations, nor result in any staff redundancies.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the plan to restructure the Citizens Information Board&rsquo;s (CIB) service delivery partners, comprising 42 Citizens Information Services (CIS) companies and 51 Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) companies has been under consideration for a number of years now.  One of the priority objectives of CIB&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2015-2018 is &ldquo;<i>to revise the structures of Citizens Information Services and MABS to better serve the citizen by improving management structures and governance, management of resources and the delivery of consistent high quality services...&rdquo;.</i></p><p>Since the circulation to all CIS and MABS services in September 2014, of the feasibility study, commissioned by the Board of CIB, on the proposed restructure of these services, there has been ongoing and extensive consultation with all stakeholders about what the future structural model would look like.  More recently, the Board of CIB established a Restructuring Sub-Committee, comprised of a number of CIB Board members, a number of staff of CIB, and representatives of both CIS and MABS services.  This Subcommittee is expected to report its findings on the optimal regional structure for CIS and MABS companies to the Board of CIB shortly.  Following receipt of the Restructuring Sub-Committee&rsquo;s proposal, the Board of CIB will make a decision on the future regional structure for CIS and MABS companies.</p><p>While a full cost benefit analysis has not been undertaken, indicative medium term savings achievable are estimated by CIB to be in the region of &euro;340,000 per annum.  The final model as decided by the Board of CIB will ultimately determine the establishment costs of implementing the new structure, and the resultant savings achievable.  </p><p>A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, following a reduction in the significant administrative burden associated with maintaining 93 individual companies nationwide.  This in turn should improve the service-user experience, allow for the development of additional specialist roles where required, and achieve consistency in service delivery standards across the network.  Additionally, a more streamlined service delivery partner model would assist CIB in the fulfilment of its statutory obligations, help to promote awareness of the wide range of services and supports available to citizens on behalf of Government, and, in so doing, further raise the profile of both MABS and CIS Services.  </p><p>In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services, and &euro;24 million is allocated to the network of MABS services. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, an indication of trends in youth unemployment in Limerick since 2011 is available from the Live Register.  The number of young people signing on in Limerick City, and included in the Live Register, has fallen by over 60%, from 2,853 in January 2011 to 1,080 in January 2017. </p><p>The 2011 figures mentioned, together with other relevant data, provided an indication of the scale of social and economic disadvantage in the areas of the city that were to be covered in the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan launched in late 2013.  The Implementation Plan, envisaged a significant works programme comprising of physical works as well as economic and social initiatives, all with the aim of improving the lives of people living in the Regeneration communities and in the wider city areas.</p><p>My cabinet colleague, Minister Coveney launched the Review of the Limerick Regeneration Framework Implementation Plan in Limerick on 9 December 2016.  The review of the Plan is an important milestone which examines progress across a number of thematic areas including youth unemployment using common socio-economic indicators. </p><p>Amongst the actions being supported under the overall Regeneration programme are precise actions to support work training and skills development focused on addressing youth unemployment.  Training for residents in new work skills and investment in community and social enterprises and in strategic projects has resulted in over 300 jobs.  The regeneration-supported Hospitality Education and Training Centre in Roxboro has achieved an exceptional 85% placement rate from the training course that finished recently and of some 250 full and part-time jobs that have been secured to date, 220 went to people from the regeneration areas.</p><p>Investment in school services, community centres, family support and youth work and activities for young people, have supported increased attendance at schools, a reduction in early school leaving and higher numbers going on to third level education which will all ultimately help improve levels of youth unemployment.  A dedicated resource for economic development in regeneration areas has been established within Limerick City and County Council to provide a focal point for Community Enterprise, Agencies and the private sector and drive forward the key recommendations of the Review.  The next phase of economic development will concentrate on projects of scale that will become city wide catalysts for economic development and ensure a sector-focused skills training approach and include replication of the successful model employed for the Hospitality Education &amp;amp; Training Centre. </p><p>At national level, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment &ndash; including youth unemployment &ndash; is twofold.  The <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>support continuing strong economic recovery and employment growth.  Policies and actions to ensure that unemployed people benefit from the increase in employment are set out in the strategy paper <i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020</i>. </p><p>To date, these policies have been effective in reducing youth unemployment.  Youth unemployment is generally higher than adult unemployment in all EU member states &ndash; because, at any time, a large number of young people are recent leavers from education and seeking a first job.  However, the most recent data show that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.1% in 2012 to 14.5% in December 2016.  Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current EU figure of 18.8%.</p><p>Policy continues to focus on support for the young unemployed.  Under the Youth Guarantee process there is monthly engagement by case officers with unemployed young people to assist them to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.  Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes.  </p><p>I am confident that these current and planned measures will support further reductions in youth unemployment, nationally as well as in Limerick. </p></reply>

Indeed, the views of the international community on settlements couldn&rsquo;t be clearer &ndash; they are comprehensively set out in UN Security Council Resolution 2334 and in the declaration of the Paris Conference which I participated earlier this month.  These settlements are illegal, they actively undermine the prospects for a sustainable negotiated two-state solution, and the relentless expansion of settlements inherently involves injustice and provocation for Palestinians.  </p>  <p>  These most recent announcements, proposing more than 3,000 units, are deeply disappointing.  Such actions serve only to undermine Israel&rsquo;s reputation and the credibility of its government&rsquo;s declarations of support for a negotiated, peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>  <p>  In particular, the intention to proceed with new settlements in East Jerusalem only serves to call further into question the commitment of the Israeli government to engage in meaningful negotiations aimed at achieving a two-State solution.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains steadfast in its support for a comprehensive two state solution which protects the future of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.</p>  <p>  I call for an end to all settlement construction, and the reversal of these announcements.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Ireland also contributed to the drafting of a firm statement issued on behalf of the EU by High Representative Mogherini. </p>  <p>  I have consistently argued, at EU and international level, that the international community needs to take stronger action in response to settlement activities.  This has contributed to a number of EU actions in recent years, including excluding settlements from EU research funding, refusing to accept Israeli health certification for meat produced in settlements, and guidelines on labelling of products from settlements.  I will continue to pursue this policy approach.</p></reply>

These include tensions in southern Kaduna, between members of the Fulani people, a predominantly nomadic group dispersed across the Sahel region and West Africa, and other communities.  They have given rise to clashes over land access and use, including acts of violence allegedly perpetrated by some members of the Fulani, as well as other groups.  I condemn all such acts, which have caused hundreds of deaths and the destruction of property.  It is vital that all those responsible be brought to justice.   </p>  <p>  We strongly support efforts to find solutions to the underlying issues which give rise to such conflicts.  In this case, I particularly welcome the signing, in March last year, of the Kafanchan Peace Declaration, which commits a range of stakeholders and community leaders to the principles of dialogue and non-violence in finding lasting solutions to the problems of inter-communal conflict.  The negotiation of this Declaration was facilitated by the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue.  Ireland has supported the international work of this organisation for a number of years, including through the provision of &euro;100,000 in 2016 for its work in Nigeria.  Our Embassy staff in Abuja attended the signing of the Declaration, and continue to monitor and report on the situation in the region.  We will continue to encourage all parties to engage in the ongoing efforts to address the roots causes of this conflict.</p></reply>

The Decree, issued under the State of Emergency which has been in place in Turkey since the failed coup in July 2016, has been used to target officials at the Education Ministry, the gendarmerie, and academics, as well as many other public servants, for their suspected links with certain organisations, e.g. the G&uuml;lenist movement. </p>  <p>  This Decree brings the numbers of public servants dismissed since the coup to almost 100,000 people.  Many others have been detained or arrested.  I acknowledge that Orders issued on 23 January limit the period of detention without charge to seven days rather than 30, and establish a complaints process for those who feel they have been mistreated under the emergency measures.  However, this latest round of dismissals heightens my ongoing concerns about human rights, democracy, rule of law and freedom of expression in Turkey.  I once again call on the Turkish authorities to exercise restraint in responding to the challenges they continue to face in the post-coup environment.    </p>  <p>  I am monitoring closely the Constitutional amendment package which was approved by the Turkish Grand Assembly on 21 January.  President Erdogan, who was the originator of many of the proposed changes, gave his formal approval to the package on 10 February.  The proposed amendments will now be put to the people in a referendum scheduled to take place on 16 April.  Among the proposals are provisions for an increase in the number of MPs from 550 to 600, a lowering of the minimum age to sit in Parliament from 25 to 18, the holding of concurrent parliamentary and presidential elections every five years, the abolition of the post of Prime Minister and a considerable expansion of the executive powers of the President. </p>  <p>  While the Head of State in many democracies has a strong executive function, the ongoing concerns at EU level and internationally about democracy and the rule of law in Turkey, mean that there are serious considerations about the substance, timing and context of the constitutional proposals.  The assessment of the Venice Commission (Council of Europe), which is currently studying the amendments, will be important in informing the position that the EU and Ireland take on the proposed reforms.</p></reply>

The programme also supports a wide range of other diaspora engagement projects, particularly cultural, community and heritage projects that foster a vibrant sense of Irish community and identity, as well as strategic capital projects.</p>  <p>  The overall budget for the Emigrant Support Programme in 2017 is &euro;11,595,000.  This matches the allocation for 2016.  The 2017-18 grant round is open for applications until 15 February. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Emigrant Support Programme which is specifically targeted at funding projects supporting and engaging the global Irish community, this important objective is also an integral part of the wider work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in particular the work of our Missions abroad.  As such this important area of the Department&rsquo;s work attracts significant other resources, both human and financial, but this expenditure is not part of a specific allocation or diaspora activity budget that is reported on separately.  Rather this work is undertaken annually as part of the core work of Missions, within the wider Departmental and Mission budget.</p>  <p>  For 2017 an additional budget of &euro;400,000 was allocated to my Department to support local diaspora engagement.  My Department is currently considering strategic priorities around this aspect of our engagement with the global Irish and how that new fund can be best structured and administered to achieve priority outcomes. </p>  <p>  A full list of previously funded organisations under the ESP can be found at www.dfa.ie/global-irish/support-overseas/emigrant-support-programme/.</p></reply>

In this regard, public bodies are encouraged to use these frameworks arrangements.  The benefits arising from these central procurement frameworks include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; enhanced service levels and legal certainty.  It is Government policy, as set out in Circular 16/2013, that public bodies, where possible, should make use of all such central arrangements.  Where public bodies choose not to utilise central procurement frameworks they should be in a position to provide a value for money justification.  It should also be noted that the OGP issued Circular 10/2014 which contains initiatives aimed at facilitating SME access to public contracts.</p></reply>

The Plan has a much broader remit than the LEADER programme and contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies to support the economic and social development of rural areas.</p>  <p>  The LEADER programme 2014-2020 is currently being delivered by 28 Local Action Groups (LAGs) throughout the country.  The Action Plan for Rural Development acknowledges that these LAGs have a vital role to play in the development and revitalisation of rural Ireland through the delivery of the LEADER programme.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of other actions in the Plan which will be implemented by organisations that deliver LEADER as part of the LAGs.  These include, for example, actions relating to the Rural Recreational Scheme, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, and the CL&Aacute;R programme. </p>  <p>  One of the Government&rsquo;s key objectives is to ensure a more coordinated approach to the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  The Action Plan for Rural Development provides the framework for this improved coordination.  My Department will be working closely with the relevant Departments, agencies and other providers over the coming months to achieve improved coordination and cooperation through the delivery of the Plan.</p></reply>

Our community rated market is supported by a Risk Equalisation Scheme funded by a community rating levy payable by insurers on all written policies.  The levy is collected by the Revenue Commissioners from insurers and all of the monies collected are paid over to the Risk Equalisation Fund administered by the independent regulator - the Health Insurance Authority.  The Authority redistributes the monies back to the health insurance companies by way of credits in respect of older and sicker people.  The scheme is designed to protect community rating by spreading the cost of insuring older and sicker people across the market and allows all people to continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product.</p><p>It is important to note that increasing the stamp duty levies does not increase costs across the market.  The Scheme is exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State.  Insurance companies operate as commercial providers and as Minister for Health, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s prices.  The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations.  Each of these are contributors to the cost of care, the cost of claims and therefore the cost of premiums payable.</p><p>We have a highly competitive private health insurance market.  Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing their level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority website offers a clear price comparison and can be accessed at <i>www.hia.ie</i>.  All of the health insurers provide a number of lower cost plans, affording consumers the opportunity to find value in the market and to access the level of cover appropriate to their individual or family needs.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model, AIM (Access and Inclusion Model), provides supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m was provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from this year onwards.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case she has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

In each of these settings, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is carried out together with an assessment of mental state and a risk assessment for suicide.  On the basis of this, a care plan is drawn up and the next steps depend on the psychosocial stresses identified together with the presence or absence of a mental illness such as depression.  The progression of the development of a clinical programme for the assessment and management of self harm presentations in Emergency Departments is one of the HSE's National Service Plan priorities for 2017.</p>  <p>  Community Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Mental Health teams are the first line of specialist mental health services for children and young people.  There are currently 67 Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams and 3 liaison services nationally.  The multidisciplinary team, under the clinical direction of a Consultant Child &amp;amp; Adolescent psychiatrist, includes junior medical staff, psychologists, social workers, nurses, speech &amp;amp; language therapist, occupational therapist and child care workers.  The assessment and intervention provided by such teams is determined by the severity and complexity of the presenting problem(s).  This range of disciplines and skills offer a care and treatment package geared to individual needs.  </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) helps to support a wide array of work in communities, in partnership with the voluntary sector, across the country that focus on promoting positive mental health and reducing suicide and self-harm by providing significant grant funding each year, as well as by assisting in coordinating and giving strategic direction to the work undertaken in this area.  NOSP supports a range of services for teenagers and young people including Pieta House, SpunOut.ie ReachOut.com/Inspire Ireland, BeLongTo.  The 24 hour call services provided by the Samaritans and Childline are available to any young person in distress and are also funded by the NOSP.  In addition, the NOSP also worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Well-Being in Primary and Post Primary Schools.</p></reply>

Therefore, the financing of the PPP project is managed by the NDFA on behalf of the Department of Finance, who submitted an application to the European Investment Bank (EIB) for funding.

A number of recommendations arising from this review have already been implemented.   </p>  <p>  In addition, a full process review is underway of the qualification recognition function necessitated by Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications.  Guidance documents and application forms for both Directive and non-Directive applicants are also being revised to include automation of processes where feasible. </p>  <p>  The NMBI continues to engage with and update Stakeholders including the Department, HSE and Nursing Homes Ireland on these initiatives.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-14a.893.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400073#WRN06300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 to 366, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The applicant can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p>  <p>  It is the policy of Government to support older people to remain in their own homes and communities, and maintain their independence, for as long as possible.  However, there will always be a cohort of people for whom this is not an option, despite the level of support that might be provided to them in their homes, and so full-time nursing home care is indeed best suited to meet their care needs.  This is why the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is so important.  </p>  <p>  The first step in the NHSS application process is a care needs assessment to identify whether or not the applicant needs long-term nursing home care.  This is carried out by appropriate health care professionals, appointed by the HSE, using the Common Summary Assessment Report (CSAR).  This assessment will include consideration of the following:</p>  <p>  -  a person's ability to carry out the activities of daily living;</p>  <p>  -  the medical, health and personal social services being provided or available to the person both at the time of the carrying out of the assessment and generally;</p>  <p>  -  the family and community support available;</p>  <p>  -  the person's wishes and preferences. </p>  <p>  On completion of the assessment, the healthcare professionals involved will summarise their findings in the CSAR and submit this to the Local Placement Forum (LPF).  The LPF will then consider the CSAR and make a determination as to whether the applicant requires care services, and also whether the applicant is likely to require care services for the remainder of their life.  This is a comprehensive process and has been put in place to ensure that there is no doubt surrounding whether a person has a requirement for long-term nursing home care or not.  The LPF in all locations consists of a multidisciplinary team and in general is supported by a Consultant Geriatrician where they are available.  </p>  <p>  The comprehensive care needs assessment conducted as part of the NHSS application process, together with the fact that older people are entering residential care facilities later in life, mean that those entering long-term residential care will have reasonably high levels of dependency. </p>  <p>  All nursing homes - public, private and voluntary - are registered and inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continuous improvement and to monitor safety in Ireland's health and personal social care services.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive framework, including the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People and the Health Act, 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations, 2013.  The Regulations require that registered providers must ensure that the number and skill mix of staff is appropriate having regard to the assessed needs of the residents and the size and layout of the designated centre. </p>  <p>  Nursing homes provide an important resource in the range of care services available to older people in Ireland.  They play a vital role in ensuring that older people have access to the high quality of care and support they deserve at a vulnerable stage in their lives.  </p>  <p>  Homecare is an increasingly important part of the supports that we offer to older people, and will continue to increase in importance into the future.  Services are provided on the basis of assessed health care need and there is no means testing.  However, home care services are not currently formally regulated.  It is my view, and that of the Government, that we need a stand-alone funding scheme designed for homecare that recognises its particular characteristics together with regulation of homecare services.  The development of a regulatory and funding model for homecare services is a complex undertaking involving very significant legislative, operational and financial resources.  The development of such a scheme is a priority for me, as Minister.</p></reply>

In 2016, I made over &euro;11m of 2016 Winter Initiative funding available to provide additional patient treatment in 2016.  Specifically &euro;2m of the funding was made available for surgery for scoliosis patients.  The Children's Hospital Group has advised me that, in 2016 over fifty additional patients were treated under this initiative.</p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to submit to me by 17 February Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months for an inpatient, daycase procedure or outpatient appointment by the end of October 2017. </p>  <p>  On 7 February a number of actions in relation to scoliosis were announced.

Public patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of the country abroad under CBD.  Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways - i.e. patients must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc.  All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  In December, I granted approval to the NTPF for a &euro;5m initiative focusing on daycase procedures which will aim to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure, including in gynaecology, by 30 June.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to submit a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017 in respect of both the Inpatient/Daycase and the Outpatient Waiting Lists.  The focus of these plans will be to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October 2017.  As part of these plans the HSE has been asked to target specialties, services and hospitals with highest numbers of long waiters as well as improving in-sourcing in public sector, within and across Hospital Groups.  In addition, on 23 January, I wrote to the HSE requesting that, in developing these Action Plans, a particular focus be given to reducing waiting times in gynaecology.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there are difficulties in relation to waiting times for gynaecology services in Cork University Hospital.  On 12 January, I visited the hospital to meet with hospital management, South/South West Hospital Group management and a number of consultant obstetricians/gynaecologists, to learn at first-hand about these problems, which are in part due to staff resource challenges including those associated with recruiting Theatre Staff Nurses.  I have asked my officials to work closely with the HSE and the Hospital Group to ensure that the waiting list for gynaecology procedures is addressed as a priority.</p>  <p>  The hospital has advised that the provision of additional gynaecology operating capacity is a priority for the Executive Management Board, as is the optimisation of output from those theatres sessions already in place.  In that regard, the Board is working with the Gynaecology Department and the Hospital Group to maximise capacity in the theatre sessions already in place, recruit additional Theatre Staff Nurses to provide additional theatre time and to progress the introduction of pre-admission assessment for these patients to improve efficiencies and patient flow.</p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the newly established National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP).  The NWIHP will lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services, ensure the consistent delivery of high quality care in these services and oversee the development of maternity networks.  Governance arrangements for the networks will be agreed between the NWIHP and the hospital group CEOs.  It will facilitate greater oversight and support for service providers.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the new maternity network which is currently being established in the South/South West Hospital Group (SSWHG) will ensure better coordination and utilisation of maternity and gynaecological resources across the group.  In that regard, I am pleased to note the very recent appointment of Professor John Higgins as Clinical Director Women and Children Services for the SSWHG.  I am advised that Prof. Higgins will assume clinical and executive responsibility for maternity services in the Group's four maternity hospitals viz Cork University Maternity Hospital, University Hospital Kerry, University Hospital Waterford and South Tipperary General Hospital on the 28 of February next.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly on the specific questions raised concerning the assessment of patients on the Cork University Hospital gynaecology waiting lists.</p></reply>

In excess of 2000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to submit to me by 17 February Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months for an inpatient, daycase procedure or outpatient appointment by the end of October 2017.  These Plans will utilise both the capacity within the private hospital system through outsourcing, whilst maximising existing capacity in our public hospital system through insourcing within hospital groups.  The Plans are being developed in conjunction with, and supported by, the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of the remaining &euro;10m of 2017 funding for patient treatment, which I expect to receive by 24 February. </p>  <p>  Initiatives organised by the NTPF and HSE will target the longest waiting patients and as such will include patients waiting for treatment in Galway University Hospital.</p></reply>

This Guideline is being chaired by Professor Michael Turner.

Switzerland and the EEA countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway are also members of the RASFF.  Whenever a member of the network has any information relating to the existence of a serious direct or indirect risk to human health deriving from food or feed, the information must be notified to the Commission.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is the national contact point for the RASFF.</p><p>I have not had specific contact with my UK counterpart about the UK&rsquo;s continued participation in the RASFF post Brexit.  Work is ongoing to deepen analysis of the potential implications of Brexit.  However, this is challenging as it is not yet known what new arrangements may emerge as regards the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.  It is also important to state that until the UK formally withdraws from the European Union, it remains a full member, with all of its existing rights and obligations.</p><p>The FSAI has advised that between 2010 and 2016, the number of original notifications to the system was more than 3,000 per year, of which Ireland contributed 31-57 per year (see annual data in following table).  Many of the notifications from Ireland concern foods which did not originate in Ireland, while the number of notifications concerning foods which originated in Ireland is very small &ndash; less than 1%.<table><tr><th colspan="8">RASFF Notifications 2010-2016</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>Original Notifications submitted by Ireland</td><td>33</td><td>49</td><td>53</td><td>42</td><td>42</td><td>57</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Notifications concerning foods distributed to Ireland</td><td>65</td><td>83</td><td>82</td><td>88</td><td>117</td><td>120</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>Notifications about foods originating from Ireland</td><td>25</td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>29</td><td>24</td><td>17</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Total Original Notifications issued by the European Commission</td><td>3,349</td><td>3,718</td><td>3,441</td><td>3,168</td><td>3,128</td><td>3,005</td><td>2,944</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As a result of investment, we made some progress but there is much more to do to provide the level service that is needed.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEO of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) to discuss immediate action that can be taken to reduce waiting times for children and adolescents with scoliosis.  </p>  <p>  While the new theatre in OLCHC was commissioned in 2016, it is only now being used for scoliosis surgery due to challenges with recruiting nurses.  The hospital has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive to attract new theatre nurses with the necessary paediatric training.  As a result four new nurses will be in place by April.  A further 16 international nurses have been offered posts, and have commenced the registration process.  The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will be used to provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures in OLCHC from April.  This will allow an additional day of procedures to be carried out in the medium term.  I am advised by OLCHC that an orthopaedic surgeon post in the hospital will also be filled by June.  This means that from July, the hospital expects that the theatre use will be further increased.  In addition I will receive an Action Plan for Scoliosis from the HSE by the end of February which will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy regarding the waiting list and waiting times for children for scoliosis surgery and activity levels in hospital across the country, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

The under-6s GP service contract, which includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and a cycle of care for children with asthma, underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing primary care and keeping people well in their own community.  To date, approximately 94% of GMS GPs have entered into agreements with the HSE for the provision of services to children under 6 and almost 364,000 children under 6 have access to GP care without fees through a medical card or GP visit card.</p>  <p>  Nationally the HSE has recently written to those GMS GPs who have not yet signed up to the under-6 contract, and provided them with a copy of the contract and the Form of Agreement for their consideration.  I would hope that those GPs who have not yet signed up to offer this improved and expanded primary care service will do so and so ensure that all children aged under 6 are easily able to access general practitioner services without their parent or guardian having to pay a fee.  Where a GMS patient experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, and has unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area who are contracted to provide services under the GMS, then the HSE will assign that person to a GP's GMS patient list.</p>  <p>  In relation to the difficulties described by the Deputy in particular areas, I have asked the HSE to examine this issue and to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Subsequently a related Chairman&rsquo;s note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement set out a framework for progressing this matter, encompassing the transfer of 4 tasks (including 1st dose antibiotics, phlebotomy, cannulation and discharge where appropriate) from doctors to nurses.  A final agreement on the transfer of tasks was concluded on 17th December 2015 encompassing the roll-out of the transfer of the identified tasks and the provision of training where required for the acute sector.  While there was some delay in payment arrangements being finalised all nurses and midwives working 6-8pm in the acute sector are now receiving payment (time and one sixth) and should also have received backmoney for the period from 1 January 2016. </p>  <p>  The focus of the Agreement is on improving patient care and supporting early and timely interventions.  It is noted that the tasks are to be transferred in the context of the provision of the necessary training programmes, relevant resources being available, existing arrangements for the provision of some of the tasks, for example phlebotomy teams, and that doctors would continue to perform the tasks.  A core principle is that the task is undertaken by the staff member who is most appropriate to do so at that time and in that location.  The National Implementation and Verification Group was satisfied that the tasks had been transferred in all HSE and voluntary hospitals on the basis provided for in the Agreement or that the roll-out of the training programmes had been progressed sufficiently to justify payment under the terms of the Agreement.</p></reply>

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p>  <p>  The separate scheme of assessment for an over-70's medical card is applicable to all persons aged 70 and over.

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Programme for Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage and I anticipate that this will be brought to Government shortly.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The Deputy may be interested to note that people who previously benefitted from the now-closed Motorised Transport Grant, may, if they satisfy the criteria under that scheme, be eligible for tax relief under the Drivers and Passengers with Disabilities Tax Relief Scheme.  This scheme is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance and is operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  Details of the scheme can be found on<i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

As a result of investment, we made some progress but there is much more to do to provide the level service that is needed.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEO of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) to discuss immediate action that can be taken to reduce waiting times for children and adolescents with scoliosis.  </p>  <p>  While the new theatre in OLCHC was commissioned in 2016, it is only now being used  for scoliosis surgery due to challenges with recruiting nurses.  The hospital has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive to attract new theatre nurses with the necessary paediatric training.  As a result four new nurses will be in place by April.  A further 16 international nurses have been offered posts, and have commenced the registration process.  The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will be used to provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures in OLCHC from April.  This will allow an additional day of procedures to be carried out in the medium term.  I am advised by OLCHC that an orthopaedic surgeon post in the hospital will also be filled by June.  This means that from July, the hospital expects that the theatre use will be further increased.  In addition I will receive an Action Plan for Scoliosis from the HSE by the end of February which will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy regarding  scoliosis surgery for public patients, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

The underlying principle of these protocols is to ensure that safe care is provided to all patients at all times.  </p><p>Cancellation of elective procedures can occur for a variety of exceptional reasons including cancellations because a bed or the clinical team are not available, cancellations by the patient or because the patient may not be fit for surgery at the time.  In addition in times when our EDs are under pressure, and escalation procedures are in place, non-urgent elective procedures may be postponed.  The HSE has indicated that 53,213 elective procedures were cancelled for a variety of reasons from September 2015 to the end of January 2017.  I fully acknowledge the distress and inconvenience for patients and their families when elective procedures are cancelled.</p><p>The Deputy also requested information on whether trolleys moved from EDs to surgical day wards are included in official trolley figures.  I would like to clarify that all trolleys, including those moved to wards, should be included in the official HSE TrolleyGar count.  However if designated beds in other parts of the hospital, including those in surgical day wards, are used as surge capacity for ED patients, the patient is deemed to have been admitted as an in-patient and would not be recorded<b></b>as a trolley wait.  </p><p>The HSE intends to undertake a review of the Escalation Framework in the coming months to ensure its effectiveness. </p><p>As the further data requested relates to service issues, this request has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The person named will be notified of the outcome of this appeal on completion of the process.  In the event that the person named considers that their appeal had not be dealt with fairly, they can raise the matter with the Office of the Ombudsman. </p>  <p>  An advance payment under the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme issued to the person named on 17 October.  However as the level of penalty applied as a result of the breach detailed above exceeded the balancing payment due under this scheme, no further payment was due.

This is the first time such action has been taken by this Department.  The requirement to keep birds confined was extended on the 23 January and it will remain in place until further notice but will kept under review. </p>  <p>  My Department has emphasised the need for flochowners to confine poultry and other birds and to apply strict bio-security measures to prevent the introduction of avian influenza.  Poultry flock owners should remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Veterinary Office.  Bird gatherings (shows, exhibitions and races) are permitted under general licence, subject to prior notification and certain bio security conditions. </p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, my Department has has implemented the following various measures with a view to deal with the threat of this disease:</p>  <p>  - Key stakeholders have been regularly updated on the current situation (including Department staff, all sectors of the poultry industry, poultry and general veterinary practitioners, wild bird organisations, public health officials etc.)</p>  <p>  - A range of information and advice is provided on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Key biosecurity advice has also been published in the national press.</p>  <p>  - An Avian Influenza Helpline has been activated to answer public enquires regarding the disease, and for the reporting of sick or dying birds.</p>  <p>  - The Department has an early warning system for unusual mortalities in wild birds in place with Birdwatch Ireland, National Parks and Wildlife Service, and the National Association of Regional Game Councils. </p>  <p>  - The Department has a specialised culling team and protocols in place to protect both human health and the welfare of the birds, which will be implemented in the event that poultry flocks have to be culled. </p>  <p>  Other measures e.g. a bans on hunting, release of game bird or pigeon racing have been considered and have been ruled out at this time.  The Department continues to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and will introduce such measures as are considered appropriate.</p>  <p>  There is currently no vaccine available for use on domestic poultry. </p></reply>

Farmers with land identified as important for the hen-harrier are guaranteed access to the scheme as priority candidates in Tier One of GLAS.  I have also provided that such farmers will be automatically approved for GLAS Plus should they be farming sufficient area of habitat.  Under GLAS, farmers qualify for a payment rate of &euro;370 per hectare can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments.  Over 2,100 farmers have been accepted into GLAS 1 &amp;amp; GLAS2 with a hen-harrier action and this number will increase significantly once the approvals for GLAS 3 have been finalised.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is currently in the process of introducing important new schemes under the locally-led umbrella, for the conservation of the hen harrier and the freshwater pearl mussel.  I have provided a total budget of &euro;35 million for those two schemes.  Part of this process requires the recruitment, by public tender, of a Project Team to help develop and deliver these schemes on behalf of my Department, following a similar model to the highly successful Burren farming conservation measure.  The tender closed on 24 January last and I would expect that a contract would be offered to the successful tenderer before the end of February. </p>  <p>  The successful tenderer will be directly involved in drawing up the terms and conditions for the hen harrier locally-led scheme, along with the range of actions to be applied and associated payments.  This will be done in consultation with officials from my Department and from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as well as drawing on local knowledge and inputs from farmers on the ground.  Once this stage has been completed,  the process of recruiting farmers for a five year scheme will commence.</p></reply>

The measure was announced as part of the Brexit package in Budget 2017, and I formally launched the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme on 31 January.  Loans of up to &euro;150,000 are available from AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank over a term of up to six years, at a reduced interest rate of 2.95%.  They can be used for working capital or as an alternative to merchant credit or other short-term credit facilities.</p></reply>

The US EPA review which was referred to in the previous question considered &ldquo;chlorpyrifos&rdquo; only.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Chlorpyrifos-methyl&rdquo; is a distinctly different and less toxic molecule than &ldquo;chlorpyrifos&rdquo;.  In addition, the use pattern differs significantly in so far as the product registered in Ireland, &ldquo;Reldan 22&rdquo;, is approved for use on grain store structures and on cereal grain only, whereas chlorpyrifos in the form of various products, most notably &ldquo;Dursban 4&rdquo;, was traditionally used in a large array of crops by broadcast application. </p>  <p>  Chlorpyrifos-methyl is significantly less harmful than chlorpyrifos.  The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure level (AOEL) of chlorpyrifos-methyl is 10 times greater than chlorpyrifos while the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 20 times greater than the corresponding values for chlorpyrifos.  This means that while question marks were raised by the US EPA with regard to chlorpyrifos, the corresponding toxicological limits for chlorpyrifos-methyl, which are multiples higher, did not trigger the same concerns, and therefore regulatory action was not deemed necessary at this time. The use of chlorpyrifos-methyl will be kept under review in light of any further scientific developments.</p></reply>

I am advised that this practice in inshore waters and estuaries around Ireland is confined to fishing for sprat, which is not subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are in close contact with the Marine Institute in relation to the matters you have raised and they have advised me that no additional information, to that already furnished, is available on the work being undertaken by the Marine Institute on sprat stocks.  The three-year collaborative project between the Marine Institute and Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology to develop a detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Through the Birds and Habitats Directive, among other instruments, Ireland is committed to ensuring the conservation of biodiversity of the sea birds and mammals around our coast.  Regarding fish by-catch, I am advised that there is some herring by-catch and possibly some other species in sprat fisheries but then by-catch is a feature of a number of the fisheries around our coast.  All catches of quota species are  logged and landed and taken in to account by ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) when providing stock advice. </p>  <p>   As mentioned in my previous reply, the Marine Institute are working on adding sprat to the species covered under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Marine Biodiversity Scheme in 2017.  This would allow for more intensive data collection to enhance scientific knowledge and underpin any future  management actions for the stock.  In this regard, I have asked the Marine Institute to work in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service to consider how we can improve our knowledge, through observer programmes, of the possible impacts of these fisheries on  by-catch of other fish, sea birds and mammals.</p></reply>

We do not know yet what changes the UK may seek to the current arrangements.</p>  <p>  What we do know is that there is a strong desire and expectation from parts of the UK fishing industry for a hard Brexit on fish &ndash; a &lsquo;pulling up the drawbridge&rsquo;, to ensure that non-UK fishermen will no longer have access to the UK Zone and that all fish in that zone &ndash; currently shared with EU partners will be theirs and only theirs for the taking.  </p>  <p>  In theory, the UK could indeed restrict access to their waters and or seek to gain larger quota shares at the expense of others.  However, that could only happen if the UK were content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side.</p>  <p>  In a worst case scenario, an extreme 'hard Brexit' outcome would be a fundamental threat to the wellbeing of the seafood  sector.  On average, 36% of the Irish landings are currently taken from UK waters.  However, for some of our most important stocks the figures are even higher.</p>  <p>  Limitations on access and, more worryingly, any attempt by the UK to increase its current quota share at the expense of Ireland and others must, and will be, be resisted strenuously.  These twin threats, on access and quota, could also lead to increased  activity by other EU vessels in the waters around Ireland threatening the long term sustainability of our stocks.</p>  <p>  Once Article 50 is invoked next month, as seems likely, then the UK will cease to be a Member State of the EU from March 2019, unless an extension is sought and granted.  The EU itself will continue, as will the Common Fisheries Policy.  The process for reviewing and revising the CFP in preparation for a new Policy will commence around the same time and will be due for completion in 2022.  Ireland will again be a central player in that renegotiation.  </p>  <p>  I am firmly of the view that now is not the time to commence our internal consideration of the review of the CFP.  We must instead concentrate all our efforts on the Brexit negotiations at this time to safeguard our interests.  The discussion on the post Brexit CFP will undoubtedly occur in earnest once the Brexit arrangements are clear and I do not intend to pre-empt the outcome of negotiations that will not even begin for at least another two years.</p>  <p>  This month (1 February), I hosted a dedicated Civic Dialogue on the potential impacts of Brexit for the seafood sector as whole.  This was very well attended by stakeholders from across the industry and gave a clear insight into the real dangers that a 'hard' Brexit presents for our fishing communities. </p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  The Scheme, which was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises. </p>  <p>  The loans will be available to all livestock farmers, tillage farmers, horticulture producers and others involved in primary agricultural production.

It co-ordinates the work of official agencies which includes inspections of food businesses, food contact material manufacturers and distributors and the delivery of food  and food contact materials sampling and testing  programmes.</p>  <p>  On 16th  January 2017, the European Commission issued Recommendation (EU) 2017/84 on the monitoring of mineral oil hydrocarbons (MOH) in food and in materials and articles intended to come into contact with food was adopted.  The recommendation covers the years 2017-2018 and asks EU Member States to monitor MOH in food and food contact materials.  The recommendation is that upon detection of mineral oils, further investigations should be carried out seek to determine the contamination source.</p>  <p>  In accordance with this recommendation, the FSAI arranged for initial monitoring for the presence of mineral oil hydrocarbons in food and food packaging material to be incorporated in the 2017 National Chemical Monitoring Programme plan.   The analysis will be carried out by the HSE&rsquo;s Public Analyst Laboratory in Dublin.  Currently, a generally accepted analytical method for determining the presence of MOH both in foods and packaging is not available.  The Commission is working on a technical guidance to accompany the recommendation, which will be designed to assist Member States in sampling and determination of MOH and allow the uniform and consistent application of the recommendation.  Therefore a more extensive programme will be implemented in 2018.  Any detection of mineral oils will trigger an investigation to determine the contamination source.</p>  <p>  The EC recommendation does not include awareness rising amongst the food sector.  I am advised that the FSAI will examine the need for this when analytical methods are better developed.</p></reply>

The MRL exceedance rate for produce from all EU countries was 1.6% and the equivalent figure for produce from third countries was 6.5%.  The Irish food commodities that exceeded the MRL limit were cabbage, kale and mushrooms. </p>  <p>  MRL&rsquo;s are set by EU scientific authorities on the basis of residue trials results following the use of a pesticide in accordance with Good Agricultural Practice (GAP).  MRLs always include wide safety margins and are well below levels that could have any adverse effect on the health of consumers.  When a residue is found above the MRL, the result does not automatically mean the levels of residue found are a risk to people&rsquo;s health.  Therefore, where an MRL is exceeded, a consumer risk assessment is conducted.  The results of the assessment is provided to and independently verified by the FSAI.  The risk assessments indicated that there were no consumer intake concerns in respect of Irish produce.  </p>  <p>  In the case of Irish produce, investigations to establish the cause of the MRL exceedance are carried out by my Department.  The investigations are geared to eliminate abuses in the use of pesticides and to ensure that they are not repeated.  Offenders may be prosecuted or subjected to a fine.  In addition, produce from the origin concerned is targeted for further sampling and analysis.  Producers who were targeted as a result of 2014 exceedances were compliant in 2015. </p>  <p>  The recently introduced Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive also aims to reduce risks to human health and the environment through establishing:</p>  <p>  - Increased educational/training requirements for pesticide users, advisors and distributors.</p>  <p>  - Increased level of record keeping for all sectors in the pesticide use and retail trade.</p>  <p>  - Requirement to have pesticide application equipment tested periodically.</p>  <p>  - Increased storage requirements at farm and distribution level.</p>  <p>  - Promotion of the use of Integrated Pest Management. </p>  <p>  My Department made no representations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regarding data relating to Irish produce or brands published in the 2014 European Union Report on Pesticide Residues in Food.  Brand details are not a required field in the data submitted to EFSA.  My Department indicated to EFSA that all Irish pesticides residue data submitted to EFSA could be made available to the public.</p></reply>

Sixteen submissions were received, including one from the Environmental Protection Agency. All submissions were given careful consideration before the tyres report was finalised.</p>  <p>  The recommendations contained in the final report are now being implemented.  As part of this, the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2007 have been reviewed and new regulations will be introduced shortly, which will enable me to put in place a full compliance scheme for tyres.  This scheme will be operated, under approval from me, by Repak ELT.  Under this approval the scheme will be monitored by and be accountable to me.</p>  <p>  There is nothing unusual about the designation of a single compliance scheme for a particular waste stream.  Indeed, the above mentioned report examined this aspect and recommended that the tyre market in Ireland is such that only one Producer Organisation would be viable.  This single compliance model already works in other waste streams for example, farm plastics and packaging.</p>  <p>  The ending of the self-compliance option was also a recommendation of the report.  The self-compliance model in the current regulations is difficult to enforce.  Its removal will ensure consistency and provide a level playing field for all tyre operators. </p>  <p>  Under the Waste Management (Tyres and Waste Tyres) Regulations 2007 anyone, including any operator from the Irish tyre industry, can apply for approval to operate a compliance scheme for tyres.  Any such application would have to take account of the reporting structure that is being put in place by the new regulations.  All tyre producers, i.e., all operators placing tyres on the Irish market, will be obliged to register and report to a &ldquo;black box&rdquo;, which will be operated by Producer Register Limited.  An application would also have to indicate how a scheme will meet its members' regulatory obligations.</p></reply>

However, the issue of waste tyres in our country needs to be met head on.</p>  <p>  I have already met with three representative bodies of the tyre industry.  I listened to their concerns and I have done my best to address as many of them as possible.  I have also received a lot of support during the extensive consultation that has taken place with the industry for the introduction of the scheme for operators in the tyre market.</p>  <p>  One area of concern to the industry is the issue of market distortion.  Tyres will be a priority area for enforcement in 2017 for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities and I will be asking them to give particular attention to the border regions.</p>  <p>  Some of the tyre industry also contend that the formalisation of the existing charge, which consumers pay when purchasing a new tyre, will cause a distortion in the market, with non-compliant operators undercutting compliant ones.  The regulations that I am introducing will formalise this fee and ensure that all operators will be required to comply and that the fee will be used correctly to support the sound environmental treatment of waste tyres.</p>  <p>  The Compliance Scheme will be operated by Repak End of Life Tyres (ELT) with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited.  The scheme will carry out all regulatory functions on behalf of its members.  All operators will be obliged to provide data on the numbers of tyres coming on and off the market.  This will be the first time that there will be clarity in this regard.  It will be mandatory for anyone placing tyres on the market in Ireland to join the compliance scheme.</p>  <p>  I am convinced that the new structures will address the lack of regulation in this market to date and address the occurrences of stockpiles of waste tyres that could have a detrimental effect on the environment and human health.</p></reply>

If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.</p><p>The provision of telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by ComReg.  I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll out services to particular locations.  However, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has, however, increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.</p><p>Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites. </p><p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.</p><p>  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. </p><p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>  In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p><p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  </p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland. </p><p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment plans have not been fully demonstrated.</p></reply>

The level of technical skill required to do this type of damage is relatively low, with the tools required to do so available on line.  In these cases, the best defence is to ensure that the software running the site is up to date, with the latest software patches applied.</p>  <p>  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), in my Department, was informed of the events concerning the NTMA site shortly after it occurred, and worked with them to identify the nature of the problem.  The same day, the NCSC issued an advisory notice to all of its constituent Departments and Agencies, suggesting measures to reduce the risk of similar incidents on their sites.  Also, in the same advisory, the NCSC offered a service to constituents, in which the unit would actively scan for similar vulnerabilities on public facing infrastructure, and notify them of same.  A number of bodies have taken up this offer, and scans are being instituted on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  This service is one of an evolving family of services that the NCSC offers to public sector bodies, and the unit is continuing to develop and broaden its offerings with a view to continually improving the security of the public sector IT infrastructure owned and operated by Departments and Agencies.  The NCSC will also be, through the Public Appointments Service, launching a recruitment campaign in the coming weeks, both to enable it to further develop services for public sector bodies and to begin the process of transposing the EU Network and Information Security Directive. </p></reply>

Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and to date there have been over 300 hours of competitive dialogue.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.</p><p>The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the commercial roll-out and the State Intervention area.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure that those services are delivered.

This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>In the short-term I am working to ensure measures are put in place to assist in the roll-out of the NBP State Intervention network once a contract is awarded and to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.</p><p>In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.  The findings of this Taskforce, published in December, recommends practical actions that can be taken to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link: . </p><p>Minister Humphreys has established two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  Since July, there has been significant progress made in discussions with the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.</p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.

Over-reliance on the export of waste not only means we forgo exploiting the resource contained in our waste, it also makes the State very vulnerable in terms of our ability to manage our waste, which in turn can lead to landfill capacity issues such as those which arose last year when emergency measures were required to make additional landfill available.</p><p>In that context, notwithstanding the progress made and the continued emphasis placed on prevention and recycling, energy recovery, including anaerobic digestion, co-incineration in cement kilns and waste to energy have a role to play both in terms of delivery of the Government&rsquo;s waste policy objectives and meeting our obligations under the EU Waste Framework, Landfill and Renewable Energy Directives. </p><p>In line with the provisions of the Waste Management Act 1996, the preparation and adoption of a waste management plan, including in respect of infrastructure provision, is the statutory responsibility of the local authority or authorities concerned. </p><p>I am aware of the reports referred to in the question and would like to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that the three Waste Management Plans made in May 2015 fully reflect national and EU waste management policy in terms of the application of the waste hierarchy, in exploiting waste as a resource and in reducing the disposal of waste at landfill.</p></reply>

The "appointed day" is the day upon which the Council is established.  No such Order under section 17(22) has been made and the Council has never been established.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the 2008 Act provided for a Dublin Transport Authority, but that in 2009 the Public Transport Regulation Act recast the Authority as a National Transport Authority (NTA).  However, section 17 is still constructed as if the Council is to advise a specifically Dublin-only Authority.  Therefore, I believe that serious consideration is required as to how best to reflect the, now, national responsibilities of the NTA in the composition of any such Advisory Council.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware of the recent launch of the consultation process on the development of a new National Planning Framework.  One theme in the consultation document is an identified need to better integrate regional transport and land-use planning policies; in this regard, the document references the current approach in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) which requires mutual consistency between the NTA's regional transport strategy and the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy.  Depending on the overall approach adopted by the National Planning Framework on this issue of better integration between land-use planning and transport planning, there may well be a need to expand upon the NTA's legal powers in relation to land-use planning outside the GDA, which would again require careful consideration of how best to ensure that any Advisory Council reflects the full range of relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the above, I think it best to await the development of the National Planning Framework to ensure that its recommendations can be reflected in both the composition of any future NTA Advisory Council and its functions.</p></reply>

Clearly, the timing of enactment thereafter will depend on the availability of parliamentary time. </p>  <p>  Section 279 of the Companies Act 2014 provides that in limited cases for a particular transitional period, US Accounting Standards (US GAAP) may be used by certain companies.  This period is due to expire on 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  On 17th January 2017 the Government approved the General Scheme of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill.  One of the Heads in that Bill is a provision to extend the transitional period at section 279 by 10 years to December 2030 for those companies already availing of that  section's provision. </p>  <p>  The Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016 transposes the EU Accounting Directive, which is overdue.

To this end, we are leading and supporting a number of key initiatives in the area of community based prevention and early intervention.</p>  <p>  One of these is the ABC programme, which is a prevention and early intervention initiative led by my Department aimed at testing and evaluating prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.  The programme commenced in 2013 and was designed as a time-bound co-funding arrangement of &euro;29.7 million, in conjunction with the Atlantic Philanthropies.  </p>  <p>  In budget 2016, my Department secured an additional &euro;4.5 million to extend the entire existing ABC programme to the end of December 2017, bringing the total investment to &euro;34.2 million.  This extension also brings the existing programme closer in line with the expected timeline for the delivery of the national evaluation report by the Centre for Effective Services in 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department will utilise the emerging learning from the ABC programme and the findings from the national evaluation to inform the design of prevention and early intervention initiatives that comprehend the Programme for Government commitments.  </p>  <p>  A key purpose of the ABC programme is to identify the learning in and across the sites, and to transfer this learning into existing and established services, thus bringing improvements not only in specific areas, but addressing all areas of disadvantage.  With this in mind, my Department has also been preparing a significant programme that will assist in mainstreaming the learning from various prevention and early intervention initiatives, including the ABC programme. </p>  <p>  This Quality and Capacity Building Initiative (QCBI) aims to embed prevention and early intervention in services for children and young people, through resourcing a system change across service provision in this area.  QCBI involves creating valuable tools that capture key data and learning, and make it accessible, in addition to developing cross-sectoral capacity building measures.  Such measures will seek to enhance the quality of prevention and early intervention approaches, as well as fostering partnership among agencies and professionals who engage with children at risk of poor outcomes.  This work has been informed in part, by an important EU Peer Review hosted by my Department in 2016 which emphasised the importance of an evidenced based approach to tackling child poverty, and which specifically acknowledged the importance of prevention and early intervention in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with interested stakeholders in working on mainstreaming the learning from existing programmes and improving the lives of children across Ireland.</p></reply>

I have been advised by Tusla that the School Counselling Grants scheme, was established in 1994, to provide counselling support for children affected by bereavement or loss.  In 2011 this scheme was closed to new entrants while under the remit of the Family Support Agency.  The scheme came under the remit of Tusla upon its establishment in 2014.</p>  <p>  Tusla recognises the necessity for bereavement and loss counselling  in schools and those schools in receipt of funding under the School Completion Programme may utilise up to &euro;5,000 of this funding for such services.  In addition Tusla provides child counselling through the Agency&rsquo;s Family Support Services funding.  In 2016 funding for child counselling was increased under this scheme by &euro;154,000 to &euro;680,000.  In particular child counselling funding to approximately 70 Family Resource Centres around Ireland was increased to &euro;242,000.</p>  <p>  Tusla is the main funder of Barnardos Children&rsquo;s Bereavement Service, which works to support children and families coping with bereavement.  Funding of &euro;154,600 was provided to this service in 2016.  The Agency is also committed to the funding of Rainbows Ireland, which provides group based support to children dealing with loss following parental separation/divorce or a death.  The Rainbows programme is currently delivered in over 250 schools and community based centres around the country.  Funding in 2016 was increased by &euro;15,000 to &euro;250,000 annually.  Together with the Irish Hospice Foundation Tusla co-funds the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network, which works to improve awareness and support of bereaved children.  It provides information on how to support bereaved children targeted at professionals, teachers, schools and families.  Tusla provided &euro;35,000 in funding to this initiative in 2016.</p></reply>

Maintaining contact during imprisonment has also been correlated with reduced recidivism rates by the parent. </p><p>Following a period of research, which included a detailed survey of existing visiting facilities and supports, the Families &amp;amp; Imprisonment Group (FIG) identified a number of essential pillars that should be in place to ensure that visits in Irish Prisons become a core element of rehabilitation and support for both the people in our care and their families.  The essential pillars identified by the FIG are as follows: </p><p>- Communications</p><p>- Physical Improvements</p><p>- Staff training</p><p>- Parenting courses and resettlement interventions</p><p>- Community Partnerships</p><p>A pilot parenting programme entitled &lsquo;Parenting Plus&rsquo; was developed in partnership with Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) and delivered in Limerick prison in 2015 and 2016 as part of an overall &lsquo;Family Links&rsquo; Programme.  The programme aims are:</p><p>- To support small groups of prisoners to better understand their parenting role, and to develop practical skills which support them in positive parenting;</p><p>- To develop a parenting programme specifically for the prison population, which is effective and replicable;</p><p>- To support partners of prisoners to engage positively with their children and to offer families consistent language and approaches;</p><p>- To maximise opportunities for positive parent-child engagement within the limitation of a custodial setting;</p><p>- To increase awareness of and responsibility for supporting, positive parenting as an important element of imprisonment and resettlement planning.</p><p>A number of significant objectives have been achieved so far; most notably enhanced staff training, delivery of the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme, the establishment of more family-friendly visits, and refurbishment of visit spaces. </p><p>In addition, Family Liaison Officer training has been provided by the IPS to enable participants to:</p><p>- Understand the role and function of a Family Liaison Officer;</p><p>- Understand the logic model process, and the rationale and evidence underpinning the Family Links programme;</p><p>- Have knowledge regarding community services and structures supporting and working with children and families;</p><p>- Have an understanding of the experience of being a parent in prison and the impact on family dynamics;</p><p>- Heightened empathy for, and ability to support, parents in prison.</p><p>An independent evaluation of the Family Links Programme in Limerick which was undertaken by the University of Limerick was launched by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday (13 February) in Dublin.</p><p>Finally, I note that children may be impacted by events affecting their parents, for instance parental ill health, mental health problems or parental absence, by way of the need to work away from home or by imprisonment.</p><p>Where this is the case, parents can seek assistance from family support services in their communities by direct referral or through a child welfare referral to Tusla.  Such services can provide child counselling, family therapy or art and play therapies to help children understand and deal their feelings, and to assist the parent who is caring for them.</p><p>In relation to children (under 18) in detention any issues of concern are addressed by their individual care regimes.</p></reply>

In 2016, approximately &euro;17 million has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  In 2015, 7,282 children were admitted to the Garda Diversion Programmes.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.</p>  <p>  Under Section 88 of the Children Act 2001, a court may remand a child in custody who is charged with or found guilty of an offence, who is being sent forward for trial, or in respect of whom the court has postponed a decision.  The discretion as to whether or not to remand a child in custody is solely for the decision of the judge hearing the case.</p>  <p>  As part of the Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018, a key commitment was the development of a Bail Supervision Scheme.  The scheme, which is currently operating on a pilot basis, provides more therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The service provides a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.  The scheme offers greater options to the courts in the knowledge that closer monitoring will take place through interaction with the young people, their families and communities.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that in 2015, of the 263 orders to remand, these related to 163 children.  Furthermore, of the 93 orders issued by Courts to detain children in Oberstown, these related to 87 children.</p></reply>

The Authority has advised that to give recognition to an adoption effected in another country by applicants habitually resident in the country where the adoption is effected, the adoption would have to <i>inter alia</i>conform to the definition of a 'foreign adoption' as defined in section 1 of the Adoption Act 1991 and the application for recognition would have to be accompanied by a valid adoption order from that country.  The Authority has a legal opinion in relation to the laws of Morocco which deem them not to be in conformity with Irish Adoption Law, i.e. the effects of an adoption under Moroccan Law would not be the same as that of an adoption effected under Irish Adoption Law.  It should also be noted that an order of Kafala is not an adoption order and the effects of Kafala are not on a par with an adoption as defined in Irish legislation.  The Adoption Authority has not recognised orders of Kafala in the past.</p></reply>

The targeted element of the scheme will involve a progressive system of income-related subsidies for parents with children between 6 months and 15 years, with eligibility based on net parental income.  A family may receive either the universal or the targeted subsidy, not both.  The subsidy provided will be whichever of the universal and targeted payment is most favourable to a family.</p><p>The scheme will be available in childcare providers who are registered with Tusla, including both centre-based childcare providers (e.g. cr&egrave;ches, preschools and daycare centres) and child-minders.</p><p>For parents with net incomes up to &euro;22,700 per annum, the maximum rate of childcare subsidy will be payable.  The rate of subsidy will taper downwards as net income rises, with no means-tested/income related subsidy payable when net income reaches &euro;47,500.  For families with net income levels above this threshold, the universal subsidy may be available, depending on the age of the child.</p><p>The amount of subsidy provided, in relation to both the universal and targeted subsidies, depends on (a) the number of hours of childcare used per week, and (b) the number of weeks of childcare used per year.  The amount of subsidy does not depend on the number of hours worked, except in that a maximum of 15 subsidised hours of childcare will be available if a parent is engaged in neither work nor study.  The subsidy estimates in the table assume that each family uses 40 or more hours of childcare per week, and pays for year-round childcare.  If fewer than 40 hours of childcare are used per week, or childcare is used for only part of the year, the annual subsidy will be reduced pro rata.</p><p>The subsidy estimates in the table assume that the families in question have no income from other sources, including no other social welfare payments, and that they are making no pension contributions.  It should be noted that the amount of subsidy payable will also depend on other incomes that a family may receive, as well as on the family&rsquo;s tax arrangements, their level of pension contributions, and other arrangements such as maintenance payments.  For these reasons, the assumptions in the table regarding net income as assessed for the purpose of the Affordable Childcare Scheme are solely illustrative, and may not necessarily apply in any given family&rsquo;s situation.</p><p>It should also be noted that net income as assessed by the Affordable Childcare Scheme is reduced if a family has more than one child under the age of 15.<table><tr><th>PQ number</th><th>Assumed gross income</th><th>Assumed net income</th><th>Hourly subsidy rate for 1 year old</th><th>Maximum annual subsidy for 1 year old</th></tr><tr><td>7377/17</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>&euro;4.37</td><td>&euro;3,409 (assuming max 15 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7378/17</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>&euro;4.37</td><td>&euro;9,090 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7379/17</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>&euro;4.37</td><td>&euro;9,090 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7380/17</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>&euro;4.37</td><td>&euro;3,409 (assuming max 15 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7381/17</td><td>Below base income threshold (assuming work is paid at minimum wage)</td><td>Below base income threshold (assuming work is paid at minimum wage)</td><td>&euro;4.37</td><td>&euro;9,090 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7382/17</td><td>&euro;28,860</td><td>&euro;28,306</td><td>&euro;3.50</td><td>&euro;7,280 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7383/17</td><td>&euro;38,480</td><td>&euro;36,276</td><td>&euro;2.25</td><td>&euro;4,680 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7384/17</td><td>&euro;28,442</td><td>&euro;28,245</td><td>&euro;3.50</td><td>&euro;7,280 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7385/17</td><td>&euro;29,442</td><td>&euro;29,072</td><td>&euro;3.38</td><td>&euro;7,030 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7386/17</td><td>&euro;30,442</td><td>&euro;29,822</td><td>&euro;3.26</td><td>&euro;6,780 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7387/17</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>&euro;4.37</td><td>&euro;9,090 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7388/17</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>Below base income threshold</td><td>&euro;4.37</td><td>&euro;9,090 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7389/17</td><td>&euro;30,566</td><td>&euro;30,011</td><td>&euro;3.23</td><td>&euro;6,718 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7390/17</td><td>&euro;69,332</td><td>&euro;56,898</td><td>&euro;0.50</td><td>&euro;1,040 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7391/17</td><td>&euro;74,813</td><td>&euro;59,694</td><td>&euro;0.50</td><td>&euro;1,040 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr><tr><td>7392/17</td><td>&euro;79,398</td><td>&euro;62,032</td><td>&euro;0.50</td><td>&euro;1,040 (assuming max. 40 hours per week)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Tusla EWS receives referrals from school authorities, parents and others relating to concerns for the educational welfare of individual children.  When a young person is referred to Tusla EWS by a school, parent or another agency the initial work of the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.</p>  <p>  Tusla EWS operates three specific programmes.  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) provided to 400 DEIS schools to facilitate positive relationships between parents and their children&rsquo;s school.  The School Completion Programme (SCP) provides intensive supports to students at risk of early school leaving to enable these students to complete their education.  Both of these programmes intervene at the earliest stage when school attendance or school participation difficulties emerge in order to support parents, students and schools to address any difficulties early.  When these interventions fail to address the presenting problem a referral is made to the Statutory Education Welfare Service. </p>  <p>  When a formal referral is made action taken then falls into two distinct categories.  The first is a brief intervention (provided to 3,751 pupils in 2015/2016 school year) whereby low level intervention proportionate to the need of the individual and the family can often effectively resolve the issue, thus preventing attendance problems escalating.  For example, this work includes assistance with finding a school place and advice and support around Section 29 Appeals, suspensions and expulsions. </p>  <p>  When brief interventions fail to address the presenting problem Tusla EWS open case files. In the school year 2015/2016 Tusla EWS worked 6,920 such cases.  Problems of poor school attendance that are the manifestation of more complex and deep rooted difficulties can take significant time, expert help and on-going support from Tusla EWS to make progress.  Such work can involve developing a plan with the family, young person and school to address the various barriers identified.  These intensive interventions are used when brief interventions have not been successful, or are not appropriate in the circumstances.  Ultimately when all other reasonable interventions fail parents may be prosecuted under the Education Welfare Act (2000) legislation.</p></reply>

I wish to assure the Deputy that Tusla deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at risk of sexual abuse.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 60% of referrals to Tusla are of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed. In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.</p>  <p>  I am committed to commencing the Children First Act 2015 by the end of the year.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Children First Act 2015 will see mandatory reporting by key professionals, mandated assisting, comprehensive risk assessment and preparation of Child Safeguarding Statements by services for children, and the establishment of the Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group on a statutory basis.  Tusla is developing online training for mandatory reporters.  Children First guidelines will continue in parallel with the Act.  This sets out the roles and responsibilities for all citizens to report child welfare and protection issues to Tusla, and where criminal matters are involved, the Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  I secured additional funding of &euro;37 million in 2017, bringing Tusla's overall allocation to over &euro;700 million which allows Tusla to continue its journey in building an effective and responsive child protection and welfare system.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in more than 450 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2017, funding of &euro;57.4m will be provided to my Department for these schemes.</p>  <p>  The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to 30 national and major regional youth organisations.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2 and the Local Drugs Task Force Projects Scheme.  In addition, my Department provides funding to 20 Youth Information Centres. </p>  <p>  Youth projects and services in receipt of funding are required to complete an annual application form for my Department.  The process also involves the submission of an annual progress report detailing the services provided and the cohort of young people who participate in youth activities. </p>  <p>  My Department also funds the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, which supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.</p>  <p>  The question of additional funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services is a matter for consideration in the context of the annual Estimates and Budgetary processes and having regard to the resources available to the Government.  In recent years, my Department has been in a position to provide &lsquo;once-off&rsquo; funding to assist youth organisations and projects that were experiencing budgetary difficulties as they approach the end of the year. </p>  <p>  These youth organisations and projects came to my Department's attention through engagement with the national youth organisations, youth officers in the Education and Training Boards, through representations and submissions received and through regular meetings with youth services in the course of the year.</p>  <p>  I and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and projects.

In order to effectively address each of these issues, my Department invests a considerable amount in research and data, including the State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children, Growing up in Ireland, and outcome indicators for the five national outcomes in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  </i>Such information is important in identifying issues and anticipating trends that need to be tackled from a policy perspective.  </p><p>My Department is responsible for a number of measures to address child poverty.  Firstly, it co-finances, with The Atlantic Philanthropies, the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017).  With additional funds which I secured in the 2016 budget this programme amounts to &euro;34 million.  The ABC Programme is designed to prevent inter-generational poverty through area based programmes with a strong prevention and early intervention focus.  My department will hold an open policy debate on 14 February to share learning from our investment in the ABC programme with colleagues in other departments such as the Departments of Health, Social Protection, Education and Tusla with a view to informing a strong focus on prevention and early intervention programmes targeting children at risk of poverty.  </p><p>My Department has committed over &euro;3m this year to the development of the Quality and Capacity Building Initiative that aims take a co-ordinated approach to the improve capacity, knowledge and quality in prevention and early intervention services for children at risk of developing poor outcomes.  </p><p>My Department also provides significant funding in a range of key areas which support a concerted response to addressing child poverty, and ensuring a strengthening of focus on the well-being and welfare of children and young people.  These include the areas of Early Years and Youth.  It also includes resources to Tusla services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families.  These are all key to supporting outcomes which assist in addressing contributory factors and reducing the impact of child poverty.</p><p>My Department is fully committed to the protection and welfare of children.  There is a clear and compelling duty on us all to protect children and to ensure their safety.</p><p>With specific regard to child protection, the Children First Act 2015 was signed into law on 19 November last year and provides, with the removal of the common law defence of reasonable chastisement, that children now enjoy the full protection of the law in relation to assault.  This new legislation will also provide for mandated reporting of child protection concerns and will require organisations working with children to prepare Child Safeguarding Statements.  I have approved phased preparations for implementation of the remaining provisions of the Act in the period up to end 2017.  </p><p>The legislation will operate side-by-side with the existing non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011.  The Guidance is currently being revised and updated to take account of the new legislative obligations so as to provide in one place a comprehensive reference resource for individuals and organisations. </p><p>A statutory Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group has been established to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure a consistent approach is adopted.</p><p>I am fully convinced that it is only by strengthening and aligning efforts in the areas of research, policy and service provision that we can effectively address many of the underlying causes that impact on child poverty and children's welfare. </p></reply>

Of these, 5,839 (93%) were in foster care, either with relatives or a general foster care placement and 325 (5%) were in a residential placement.  All of the children in residential care had an allocated social worker and 94% of all children in Foster care had an allocated social worker.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and, if necessary, to receive a child into the care of the State.  The placement of children in care is governed by Regulations.  These provide, inter alia, for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions.  Tusla has an active procurement policy and keeps its requirements under review and commissions foster and residential services as required.  This ensures that Tusla can access specialist services to meet the emotional and mental health needs of children in care.</p>  <p>  Tusla is currently implementing a three-year development plan which includes provision for extra staffing to meet critical service concerns such as addressing children with no allocated social worker.  The Government has provided significant additional resources to Tusla, and the Agency have been instructed to expedite the recruitment of staff to address such capacity concerns.  During 2016, Tusla has been active in developing its capacity to recruit and retain staff across its multi-disciplinary organisation and this will continue throughout 2017 with a particular focus on areas of highest need.  The additional funding of &euro;37 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2017 will provide increased resources to meet identified risks and service demands.</p>  <p>  The Health Information &amp;amp; Equality Authority (HIQA) inspects all Tusla run children's residential centres and foster care services, and publishes its findings on www.hiqa.ie.</p></reply>

The key principle of the Children Act 2001 is that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  When children come into contact with the criminal justice system there is an emphasis on the promotion of community based options in the first instance.  The Irish Youth Justice Service oversees a significant investment in community based programmes to divert young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, approximately &euro;17m has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.</p><p>My Department provides funding to the Irish Youth Justice Service for services relating to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus and the Bail Supervision Scheme which has recently been established.</p><p>As part of the <i>Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018</i>, a key commitment was the development of a Bail Supervision Scheme.  The scheme, which is currently operating on a pilot basis, provides more therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The service provides a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.  The scheme offers greater options to the courts in the knowledge that closer monitoring will take place through interaction with the young people, their families and communities.</p><p>If a child is remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in the children detention schools, a range of rehabilitative supports is offered to every child as part of an overall programme, which focuses on the child&rsquo;s individual needs and provides the framework for each child&rsquo;s individual journey through detention.  The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation.  Each child is the subject of an individual screening to determine any clinical services required, such as psychology, psychiatry or speech and language therapy.  A placement plan is developed and reviewed at regular intervals during each child&rsquo;s stay in detention.  The strong ethos of school attendance, education and training, in place in Oberstown, is tailored to each child's individual needs.  Education and training services are provided by the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  </p><p>The wide range of rehabilitation, education and support services provided and supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service are detailed in the Tackling Youth Crime: Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018, and a progress report covering the period 2014 to 2015, published recently can be found on my Department's website. </p><p>The Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme (FRC Programme), which is operated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides supports to 109 communities.  Tusla has provided core funding of approximately &euro;13m this year to its established network of 107 Centres nationwide, and two outreach Centres.  The primary role of the FRC Programme is prevention and early intervention through family support, by providing guidance and parenting supports, and is a key programme in reducing offending behaviour among children at risk.  The Centres emphasise the involvement of local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level. </p><p>In addition, the Educational Welfare Services of Tusla operating under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, work together collaboratively and cohesively with schools and other relevant services to promote school attendance and secure better educational outcomes for children and young people.</p></reply>

I note that recent data published from the study found that just under 10% of 17/18 year olds said that had been diagnosed with depression or anxiety by a doctor.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020)</i>recognises that mental health is an important issue, and an essential aspect of children and young people&rsquo;s social and cognitive development, as well as a necessity if they are going to reach their full potential and truly live a life filled with positive experiences. </p><p>The first of the five national outcomes is that all children and young people should be active and healthy, with physical and mental well-being. <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>contains a number of specific commitments in the area of mental health.  The Department of Health is responsible for this national outcome.</p><p>The National Youth Strategy, a constituent strategy of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>also includes commitments identified by young people themselves, such as access to online youth mental health services.</p><p>With reference to policy and practice in the area of mental health, I note that this falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Health.</p><p>The HSE supports timely access to appropriate services to address the mental health needs of all children from a preventative care model and early intervention perspective.  The HSE Service Plan 2017 also contains various commitments to support positive mental health measures to support young people ranging from publicity campaigns such as the <i>littlethings</i>campaign to better and more integrated early intervention counselling services at statutory and non-statutory levels.</p><p>Any parent who suspects his/her child may be suffering from mental health issues should bring their child to their local GP who will in turn refer the child to the appropriate Mental Health Services, Primary Care or Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).  The HSE has a Standard Operating Procedure for both in-patient and community based CAMHS.  This should help to ensure that services are delivered consistently and transparently.  Most importantly, it helps to ensure that the care and treatment offered reflects the identified clinical needs of the child.  However, not all mental health problems are the sole remit of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, depending on the nature and severity of the health need, support services may be also provided by HSE Primary Care or through Tusla. </p></reply>

The Scheme will be open to all Tusla-registered childcare providers, including child minders. In the Heads of Bill and General Scheme for the Affordable Childcare Scheme Bill, it is also proposed that the legislation should allow for the possibility of additional categories of childcare provider to access the scheme, including childminders who are currently exempt from the Early Years Regulations and standalone afterschool services, provided that such providers meet quality criteria that are to be specified in accordance with the legislation.  While it is proposed that the legislation should allow for this possibility, no decisions have yet been made on whether, when or by what criteria specified groups of non-registered providers might access the Scheme.  The issue will be further considered during the process of drafting legislation and in consultation with stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In order to meet the needs of parents whose preference is to use a child minder, and to build capacity to cater for increased demand in future years, the Department has commenced talks with Childminding Ireland (CMI) in recent months to explore a number of options around how quality can be assured within the childminding sector.  A Working Group has been established, chaired by CMI, and including officials from Tusla and the DCYA, to make recommendations on reforms and supports for the sector in the short, medium and long term, and the feasibility and implications of the migration from voluntary to mandatory regulation.  These will include recommendations in relation to childminders who are not currently eligible to apply for registration with Tusla (those minding three or fewer pre-school children, or those minding school age children only).</p>  <p>  My colleague Minister Bruton and I will shortly publish an Action Plan on School Age Childcare which will include actions relating to the development of quality standards for the school age childcare sector, as well as the establishment of a Working Group to recommend a robust quality assurance system for centre-based school age childcare settings.</p></reply>

A letter of invitation to attend information sessions on a Defence Forces Employment Support Scheme issued to persons aged between 18 and 24 years selected from the Live Register in counties Clare and Limerick.  Relevant details are provided below for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.  The Programme for a Partnership Government and the White Paper on Defence committed the Government to putting in place a new employment support scheme with the direct involvement of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The objective of this scheme is to help develop a path to economic independence for participants, aged between 18 and 24 years, who are at a serious disadvantage owing to their current socio-economic situation.  The scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose. Participation in the scheme is voluntary.   </p>  <p>  The scheme and the programme content have been developed through detailed discussions involving the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Social Protection and the Dublin and Dun-Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  The Department of Social Protection identifies suitable participants.  Participants retain any Department of Social Protection benefits that they are currently entitled to for the duration of the Scheme.  Participants do not receive any payment from the Department of Defence.     </p>  <p>  The scheme is a training programme of ten (10) weeks duration, consisting of five (5) weeks of training delivered by the Defence Forces interspersed with five (5) weeks of educational orientated training by the Education and Training Board. </p>  <p>  A successful pilot programme was held in Gormanston Camp from Monday 20 June 2016 to 26 August 2016 with 25 participants.  Following an evaluation of the pilot programme and Ministerial approval, the current plan is to run up to 2 iterations of programme in 2017. </p>  <p>  A programme will commence in Limerick on 22 May 2017.  The Department of Social Protection invited 1,006 persons selected from the Live Register in counties Clare and Limerick aged between 18 and 24 years to attend information sessions about the scheme. </p>  <p>  260 persons attended the information sessions which were held on 16 and 17 January 2017 which were conducted jointly by personnel from the Defence Forces and Department of Social Protection.  There are 30 places on the programme and the selection process is ongoing.   </p>  <p>  Let me reiterate that the letter inviting people to attend the information session was not an invitation to join the army and does not form part of any recruitment campaign to the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

Primaquine kills the dormant &lsquo;hypnozoite&rsquo; phase of malaria parasite which, if not killed, would have the potential weeks, months or years after returning home to give rise to a full-blown attack of malaria.  The Director Medical Branch of the Defence Forces has indicated that Primaquine is unique in its action.  There is no other medicine available which serves this purpose.</p>  <p>  While Primaquine is not authorised by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), I am informed that provision is made under the relevant legislation (Medicinal Products Control of Placing on the Market Regulations, 2007, (SI No 540 of 2007) for medicines that are exempt from authorisation when supplied on the order or prescription of a registered doctor for use by his or her individual patient under his or her direct responsibility in order to fulfil the special needs of those patients.  I am advised that the usual circumstance leading to the prescribing of a medication which is not authorised is the non-availability of a similar authorised product.   </p>  <p>  You will be aware that my Department has reconvened the Malaria Chemoprophylaxis Working Group.  The use of the Primaquine drug in the Defence Forces is being reviewed as part of the overall medical treatment process for those deployed to malarious areas.  The Group expects to finalise its report shortly. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-14a.1846.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017021400087#WRBB03200"><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Aeromedical Desk in its National Emergency Operations Centre is responsible for the co-ordination of transport arrangements for paediatric organ transplant transfers to the UK.  Air transport for these patients is currently provided in three ways: Air Corps fixed-wing and rotor-wing aircraft; Irish Coast Guard rotor-wing aircraft; and private air ambulance providers.  As one of the components of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps contributes to all roles assigned by Government including responsibilities relating to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power and maritime security tasks.  Like other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps also undertakes other roles in accordance with agreed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).   </p>  <p>  In this context, the Department of Defence has an SLA with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients and medical teams between hospitals within Ireland and abroad, on an as available basis.  In accordance with the SLA, this availability is dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.  The terms of the SLA do not provide for the Air Corps to deliver a dedicated, 24/7 transport service.  This approach was maintained in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which stated that the Air Corps will continue to provide an emergency inter-hospital transfer service in support of the HSE on an as available basis.  This means that fixed or rotary wing aircraft are not required to be on standby for this purpose.  However, if such aircraft and personnel are available when requested for a mission, they can be deployed.   </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for inter-hospital transfer tasks has reduced.  This is largely because the Air Corp has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel which is outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  This has led to a shortage of experienced pilots which has reduced the number of available flying crews. Due to these crew shortages, aircraft availability for the inter-hospital air ambulance service is reduced.  Every effort is being made to address these personnel shortages faced by the Air Corps.  A plan is in place, which it is currently working through, to increase the number of pliots.  There are 28 cadets, in 3 classes, undergoing the various stages of the Air Corps cadetship to become pilots.  However, this will only yield results in the medium term. </p>  <p>  My officials will continue to keep the Department of Health and the HSE fully informed of the situation in the Air Corps so that the HSEs Aeromedical Desk can ensure the arrangements they have for the transport service are as robust as possible.   </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Air Corps will continue to provide as much support for emergency inter-hospital transfers as possible, having regard to available capabilities and its primary responsibilities.</p></reply>
