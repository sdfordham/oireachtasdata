Proposals for these agri-food tourism projects may also include support for local food and artisan markets.</p><p>My Department proposes to allocate a range of funding between &euro;50,000 and &euro;100,000 (excluding VAT) for each successful application.  The Department's financial contribution will not exceed 70% of the total eligible costs of the proposal.  Capital expenditure will not be eligible.  Submissions from Local Authorities must be received by my Department by Monday 7<sup>th</sup>November in order to be considered.</p><p>Applications will be considered on a competitive basis against the other proposals received, the award criteria, the overall objectives of the CEDRA Fund to energise the rural economy and, where possible, to align proposals with the environmental sustainability goals of my Department's strategy - Food Wise 2025.</p><p>The evaluation process will take account of the following criteria:</p><p>- Collaboration: the number of Local Authorities participating in each application.</p><p>- The focus of proposal with regard to facilitating the establishment, continuation and enhancement of agri-food tourism. </p><p>- Costings of the proposal, value for money and timetable.</p><p>- Evidence that the proposal has the support of the local community and stakeholders, and has the capacity to stimulate rural community regeneration and further generate community interaction.</p><p>In addition, other supports for local markets are provided for by Bord Bia through the provision of information, assistance and publicity via their website to local food, country and farmers markets that include:</p><p>- A list of Farmers and Country Markets</p><p>- A Guide to Food Markets in Ireland</p><p>Furthermore, recognising the need to assist small Irish food and drink start-up producers and traders in developing their market produce and brands, the support of skills and best practice for market organisers is also provided by Bord Bia.  One such scheme is the voluntary Good Practice Standard for Farmers Markets that promotes good market governance and food safety and labelling compliance; whilst at the same time encouraging regular farmers markets to be held in local communities that stock a substantial proportion ideally 50% of locally derived or seasonal produce.</p><p>A new and important initiative to support Farmer and Country markets, which is starting in November, is the regional workshops designed by Bord Bia to help stall holders sell better at farmers' markets.  The workshops aim to give practical solutions to challenges that all market sellers may encounter and covering key areas of the market business and an opportunity for existing and prospective producers to network and share their experiences.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-27a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102700056#WRA00800"><p>Since taking up office, one of my priorities has been to address the impact on farmers of the sustained period of lower commodity prices.  I am conscious that this has caused cash flow difficulties for farmers in several sectors and I am committed to using all efforts to address this issue.  The &euro;150 million fund for "Agri Cash Flow Support" announced on budget day is one part of a three pillar strategy being put in place to respond to income volatility.  The other pillars concern additional tax measures and farm payments.  My objective is to ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and resilient agricultural sector. </p>  <p>  In my discussions with stakeholders, one of the main difficulties identified was the absence of low-cost flexible finance.  This fund will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%.  It will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  The proposed interest rate will represent a significant saving to farmers when compared with other forms of finance currently available.</p>  <p>  Further details of the loan fund will be provided shortly.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) will make an open call for lending institutions to participate and I have encouraged the main banks to make this facility available to their customers.  Normal lending assessment criteria will apply although the loans will be 'unsecured' in nature, thereby facilitating a more straightforward application process. </p>  <p>  This loan fund represents a ground-breaking and innovative approach to delivering support to farmers and it is designed to maximise the leverage achieved on the funding available.  The provision of &euro;11.1million in EU funding and &euro;14 million in National funding by my Department enables the SBCI to leverage the total fund of &euro;150 million. </p>  <p>  I would encourage farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now, and if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-27a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102700056#WRA01200"><p>I am acutely aware of the downward pressure on beef prices at present.  Looking at the market outlook for the remainder of the year it is estimated that the total number of cattle available for slaughter at export plants for the year 2016 is expected to be between 60,000 and 80,000 greater than 2015.  Figures for the year so far to the week ending 23rd October 2016 show that approximately 61,000 extra cattle have been slaughtered so far this year compared to the same period in 2015 an increase of 4.9% year to date. </p>  <p>  The true impact any increase in the number of cattle in the national herd will have on the beef market will be determined by different factors such as slaughter dates which can vary depending on the system of production on different farms.  In addition some of the increased number of cattle will be also be retained as part of the national breeding herd.  I am also very much aware of the increase in the national beef herd including beef from the dairy herd. </p>  <p>  One of the key elements in coping with an increased supply in Irish beef is ensuring that there is a market for such beef.  There is a strong demand for meat globally including beef and  figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets show a projected growth of per capita beef consumption of 2.1% for 2016.  Whilst we exported approx 98% of our beef exports in 2015 to the UK and EU I am very conscious of the importance of growing international markets as a valuable outlet for any increased Irish beef production.  Indeed this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Very significant progress has been made in this context in recent years and my Department is currently in the process of attempting to secure beef access to a range of Third Countries including China, South Korea, Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam.  This is a vital means of providing Ireland's meat processors and primary producers with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef in addition to our existing European markets. </p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers especially in an environment where the number of calf births has increased in the last number of years.  The recent opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports has seen 1,700 heavy bulls make the trip and I note that another load of 3,000 weanlings set sail last week.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco. I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.  It is for this reason I led a major trade mission to four Asian Countries in September and why I will be leading another one to Algeria and Morocco next month.  It is only through further increasing our footprint internationally that we will help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the ensuring that there are sufficient market opportunities to create a sustainable demand for Irish beef and my Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia will continue to work to ensure that any increase in production from the Irish beef herd can deliver a viable return to the Irish Beef sector and the primary producer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-27a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102700056#WRA01500"><p>Afforestation of both native and non-native species can contribute towards the protection and enhancement of water quality and can also help in reducing the risk of flooding in lower lying areas of the catchment. </p>  <p>  In relation to water quality, new, well sited forests help reduce sediment mobilisation and runoff into nearby watercourses thereby protecting the quality of the water for fisheries and other aquatic life.  These forests also help reduce nutrient runoff and contribute towards stabilising the banks of rivers and streams.  Forests also play an important role in reducing the risk of flooding through canopy interception, the use of water by the trees themselves, and the higher infiltration rates and greater storage capacity within forest soils.  While these different mechanisms vary depending on the type of forest and the season, they underline the importance of forest land use as part of any wider solution to floodwater control. </p>  <p>  My Department operates a Forestry Programme that provides funding for the creation and management of a wide range of forest and woodland types, in order to realise the variety of environmental, economic and social benefits and services forest development brings.  Various measures under the programme can be used strategically as part of a wider response to water management within a catchment.  These include the following: </p>  <p>  - The Afforestation Scheme, which can be used to deliver appropriately sited, and well-designed and managed forests and woodlands ranging from more productive-focused forests to agro-forestry plantations to more biodiversity-focused native woodlands.  Grant aid under the scheme is designed to cover the cost of establishment, and annual premiums are payable for up to 15 years.  The Afforestation Scheme can deliver a range of forest and woodland types in both upland and lowland areas, delivering floodwater management as one of many 'eco-system services'.  </p>  <p>  - The Native Woodland Conservation Scheme, which can be used to convert conifer forests alongside watercourses, into native woodland.  This scheme provides grant aid (along with a 7-year premium, for private woodland owners) to undertake the appropriate restoration of existing woodlands, and also, the conversion of conifer forest into native woodland.  Converting existing conifer forests into native woodland at strategic points along watercourses, accompanied by drain-blocking and other site restoration measures, can help reduce the risk of flooding and sedimentation of nearby watercourse by providing areas for inundation during periods of high flow.  This type of development is a key action in the protection of the freshwater pearl mussel where the improvement of water quality is of critical importance.</p>  <p>  New forests established under the afforestation scheme located within uplands and elsewhere are subject to a variety of silvicultural and environmental checks and standards, including cultivation and drainage standards, to ensure that any new afforestation does not pose an undue risk to the environment and does not exacerbate floodwaters.  In addition, native woodlands must be included alongside aquatic buffer zones in water sensitive sites such as aquatic Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and sensitive fisheries areas when establishing new forests.  This will provide a filtration buffer zone slowing down runoff from upland areas and helping to prevent sediment reaching rivers and streams.</p>  <p>  Targets for afforestation over the period 2015 &ndash; 2020 are set out in the forestry programme.  While the planting of native woodlands is less than the level expected, afforestation overall in 2015 was higher than the target set.  In relation to 2016, early figures indicate that the Department is on target to reach its targets for 2016.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-27a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102700056#WRA01800"><p>The National Forest inventory of 2012 estimated forest cover at 731,650ha or 10.5% of the total land surface of the country.  In terms of total forest cover the target is 18% by 2050. The inventory is repeated every 5 years and the 2017 inventory is currently underway.</p>  <p>  The current Forestry Programme, covering the period 2015-2020, ensures continued state support for the two key objectives of increasing forest cover and wood mobilisation.  Almost &euro;500 million of investment over the six year programme period will facilitate an increase in forest cover by almost 44,000 hectares over the period of the Programme.  The level of afforestation grant and premiums, allied to the tax treatment of income from forests provide good incentives for land-owners to plant a proportion of their holding.  Forests established in the period since 1990 are forecast to remove up to 4.5m tonnes per annum of carbon dioxide over the period 2021&ndash;2030. </p>  <p>  Climate change mitigation also occurs when forest-based biomass replaces fossil fuels for heating or power generation.  This helps to reduce the dependence on imported fossil fuels.  The new Forestry for Fibre scheme allows landowners to plant fast growing species for fuel supply into local heating markets and for CHP and other energy uses.  Support for thinning and forest road building will also help mobilise forest-based biomass for heat and power uses. </p>  <p>  Coillte will also work with my Department in implementing a viable afforestation model which will contribute towards meeting this objective.  Furthermore Coillte will continue its programme of reforestation following harvest, thereby contributing to carbon sequestration over the longer term. </p></reply>

These measures were launched under the new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 and are co-funded under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).</p><p>The measures announced were the:</p><p>1. Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme </p><p>2. Dairy Equipment Scheme </p><p>3. Organic Capital Investment Scheme </p><p>4. Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme </p><p>5. Low Emission Slurry Spreading, and the</p><p>6. Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme.</p><p>The Scheme was opened in three month tranches.  The total number of applications received under Tranches 1, 2 and 3 of TAMS II was 2,952 under Tranche 1, 2212 under Tranche 2 and 1,999 under Tranche 3.  A total number of applications under the first three Tranches of the Scheme of 7,163.  This represents a significant level of interest in investing in the sector.</p><p>Approvals have now issued in respect of a total of 4,285 applications  across the six measures under the TAMS II Scheme.  The online payment claim system has been open for the submission of payment claims in relation to approved works completed in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme since July 2016. </p><p>To date, 274 fully completed claims for payment have been received, of which 38 have been approved for payment.  However, a significant number of payment claims submitted have minor issues that need to be resolved before payment can issue.

In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase in milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April last year.  </p>  <p>  Progress on those targets was monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The fourth annual report &ldquo;Milestones for Success 2014&rdquo;, published in September 2014, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets and illustrated the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of 'smart, green, growth' is being attained.  The latest data available show growth of 34% and 32% for primary production and exports, respectively, versus the baseline period.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July last year, is the successor to the Food Harvest strategy.  It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development. Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved.  </p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success.  I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the twelve individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  The agri-food commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government align closely with Food Wise 2025.  My Department has 65 detailed commitments in the Programme for Partnership.  The Food Wise strategy for the sector contains detailed recommendations aimed at improving value added and productivity at farm and food industry level through a focus on sustainability, efficiency, knowledge transfer and innovation. </p>  <p>  In July this year, I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.  I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.</p></reply>

This information must be present up to and including the point of sale to the consumer. </p>  <p>  Operators may supplement the mandatory information on place of rearing and slaughter (and origin) with additional information concerning the provenance of the meat, provided it is not contradictory to the mandatory indications and is not  misleading.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health has overall responsibility for general food labelling legislation but my Department plays a role in the labelling of food together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and Environmental Health Officers.  Under EU law primary responsibility for the safety and traceability of food placed in the market place lies with food business operators. </p>  <p>  Authorised officers enforce the Beef labelling Regulations at different stages of the food chain under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Officers are authorised by the Department of Agriculture,  Food and the Marine  (veterinary inspectors in export-approved meat plants), by local authorities (veterinary inspectors in abattoirs and meat processing plants producing solely for the domestic market), by health boards (environmental health officers in retail butcher shops and meat distribution centres and other officials appointed by the appropriate authority).  Environmental Health Officers are also authorised under the General Labelling Regulations.</p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at stand-alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant.  In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p>  <p>  I understand that HSE has reported to FSAI that in 2015 Environmental Health Officers of the HSE carried out 2, 214 assessments for compliance with the beef labelling legislation S.I. 435 of 2000 as amended.  I am also informed that in June 2016 FSAI took a successful prosecution for six offences related to breaches of food legislation.  These included falsely declaring Irish origin for beef imported from Poland, Lithuania or Germany;  the application of false Irish slaughter and cutting plant codes used on packaging labels and having an inadequate beef traceability plan.  The FBO was found guilty of six charges, fined a total of &euro;16,000, with &euro;10,000 as an agreed contribution to costs. </p>  <p>  During 2015 and 2016 to date I understand that the FSAI has issued three prohibition orders citing breaches of legislation related to meat labelling and traceability were.  Prohibition Orders are issued if the activities (handling, processing, disposal, manufacturing, storage, distribution or selling food) involve or are likely to involve a serious risk to public health from a particular product, class, batch or item of food.  The effect is to prohibit the sale of the product, either temporarily or permanently.</p></reply>

In this context, it is critically important to have a robust and transparent legal basis for the evaluation of proposals for mergers and acquisitions.  This helps maintain the continuing viability of the beef farming industry in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I note the outcome of the European Commission's recent decision on this particular case.  The proposal has been scrutinised in accordance with the well-established procedures under competition law rules, and amongst the factors taken into account by the European Commission was the impact this merger would have upon competition in the beef and lamb sectors.  My Department wrote to the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy some time ago and provided statistical industry data in response to a questionnaire which came from DG Competition. </p>  <p>  In this particular case the analysis and decision was undertaken by the Commission as per EU competition law on the basis of the combined turnover of the parties involved.  </p>  <p>  The vulnerable position of farmers in the supply chain is widely recognised and it was for this reason that we legislated earlier this year for the establishment of Producer organisations in the beef sector.  I have also proposed to make an amendment to our Rural Development Programme which would introduce support for these organisations to improve farmers' bargaining power in the beef supply chain.  Recognition as a Producer Organisation will give farmers the right to bargain collectively with factories outside normal competition rules, strengthening their hand and allowing for a more predictable and stable supply rate, which will be of benefit to both producers and factories. </p>  <p>  Through the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the State has an existing and well-established infrastructure for the oversight of competition issues and for dealing with allegations of anti-competitive practices or the abuse of a dominant market position.  I would like to reiterate that if evidence is available of practices by this or any other entity which are contrary to competition rules, the possibility of the matter being taken up with the relevant Competition Authorities remains open.</p></reply>

Consequently the uptake of afforestation by non-farmers was relatively low, 4% in 2013 and 2014.  At the time the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 was being drafted it was decided to introduce a single premium rate now that the EU rules had changed in this regard.  The reason for introducing this change was to attract more landowners into the afforestation scheme and increase planting levels in line with the targets set in the forestry programme. </p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind that farmers still enjoy a significant advantage over non-farmers in that farmers can draw down their Basic Payment and Forestry Premium on the same land at the same time. </p>  <p>  With the introduction of the single rate the percentage of planting undertaken by non farmers has increased to 15% in 2015 and 34% so far in 2016.  However, it remains the case that the vast majority of planting is still carried out by farmers.  </p>  <p>  The total area planted increased in 2015 over the previous year and the 2016 figures indicate an increase over the 2015 figure. </p>  <p>  With regard to the equal treatment of farmers and non farmers with regard to tax relief, it is not entirely accurate to say that this is the case.  Individuals are exempt from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on standing timber while companies are not.  Furthermore, the removal of forestry income from the 'High Earners Restriction' which was included in Budget 2016 concerns active foresters and farmers only.  Section 140 of the Tax consolidation Act excludes from this exemption 'Distributions out of profits or gains from stallion fees, stud greyhound services fees and occupation of certain woodlands'.  Institutional investment funds in forestry fall under Section 140 and therefore the removal of forestry from the 'High Earners Restriction' does not apply to this group.  </p>  <p>   The value of land is of course governed by the laws of supply and demand and for those selling land this is of course a positive development.  There are many reasons why lands are put up for sale which can include such lands which are viewed as marginal for agriculture or indeed the restructuring of farm holdings following retirement, death or inheritance.  Therefore the movements in all land prices cannot be attributed solely to changes in the rules of the afforestation scheme.</p></reply>

In previous years, ICES gave separate advice for herring in 6A North and 6A South. Since 2015, ICES has found that while there are two separate herring stocks it was not possible to provide definitive, separate scientific advice and better scientific information is needed in order to provide advice on the separate stocks. </p>  <p>  In order to provide for the collection of scientific data, the EU Council set a TAC of 1,630 tonnes for Area 6A South and 4,170 tonnes for Area 6A North involving an Irish quota of 1,482t for 6A South and 630t for 6A North. </p>  <p>  In order to support carrying out a scientific acoustic survey to help inform the state of the Area 6A North herring stock,  Ireland transferred 630 tonnes to the UK as our contribution towards carrying out this survey.  In addition, a small available quota in Area 6A North, transferred from 2015, was distributed in accordance with Ministerial policy.  This is intended to cover by-catches of herring in other pelagic fisheries.</p>  <p>  In relation to 6a South herring, the Marine Institute prepared a scientific sampling methodology for data collection.  In addition, the industry proposed an acoustic survey in Area 6A South, similar to that already undertaken in Area 6A North.  </p>  <p>  The industry representatives on the Quota Management Advisory Committee comprising Producers Organisations and the Inshore Forum reached an agreed compromise regarding the allocation of available quota to meet the sampling requirements set down by the Marine Institute. </p>  <p>  I issued the proposal for public consultation which ended on 20 October 2016.  There were eight written responses received.  It was clear from the submissions that there was strong support for the Quota Management Advisory Committee proposal, which I have now adopted.  My Department has advertised seeking expressions of interest by Tuesday 1st November.  If numbers in any category are over-subscribed, a lottery for the authorisations will take place in the Department Offices on Wednesday 02 November.  It is intended that the Marine Institute will work closely with operators to support the collection of the necessary samples in the specified areas.  In addition there will be an allocation to allow for the acoustic survey to be completed in Area 6A South.  This will be carried out by 1 or 2 vessels in line with  the survey  work already completed in Area 6A North.</p></reply>

We do not have such a quota and it is extremely unlikely that we could obtain one as it would involve reducing the share of the Total Allowable Catch of those EU Member States that do have quota and for whom bluefin is an important commercial fishery. </p>  <p>  A small bluefin by-catch quota is available to Ireland for our Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea herring fishery where there is a Bluefin tuna by-catch.  This bycatch quota is also available to other Member States of the European Union.  It cannot be used for recreational and/or sport fisheries, even in the context of a catch and release programme, as  it does not allow the direct targeting of Bluefin tuna. </p>  <p>  However, I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that I have recently made funds available to allow my Department and the Marine Institute, with the support of the European Commission, to actively engage in developing Ireland's involvement in the ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) Atlantic wide research programme for bluefin Tuna.  Ireland is currently participating in an ICCAT sanctioned  scientific 'tag and release' research programme on bluefin tuna in the waters off the North West coast using experienced local vessel operators. </p>  <p>  This is a scientific research project only to assess the abundance and distribution of bluefin tuna in the waters off the Irish coast. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to improving the scientific knowledge base for the stock of bluefin tuna in the waters off Ireland and I would be hopeful that the gathering of sufficient information could help build a case that would allow for a future angling catch and release fishery.  Any such proposal would have to based on a scientific assessment from the Marine Institute and would also need to be developed in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Inland Fisheries Ireland who have responsibility for recreational fishing.  Any such case will require the support of the EU Commission and approval of ICCAT.</p></reply>

Therefore I was pleased to announce plans for a &euro;150 million fund for 'Agri Cash Flow Support' on Budget Day. </p>  <p>  This fund will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%.  It will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  The proposed interest rate will represent a significant saving to farmers when compared with other forms of finance currently available.</p>  <p>  The loan fund is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.</p>  <p>  Further details of the loan fund will be provided shortly but it is expected that it will be operational as soon as possible in 2017.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) will make an open call for lending institutions to participate and I have spoken to the main banks to encourage them to make this facility available to their customers.  Normal lending assessment criteria will apply although the loans will be 'unsecured' in nature, thereby facilitating a more straightforward application process. </p>  <p>  My Department and SBCI are breaking new ground with this innovative approach to delivering support to farmers, designed to maximise the leverage achieved on the funding available.  The provision of &euro;11.1million in EU funding and &euro;14 million in National funding by my Department enables the SBCI to leverage the total fund of &euro;150 million. </p>  <p>  I would encourage farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now, and if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.</p></reply>

In this context, it is critically important to have a robust and transparent legal basis for the evaluation of proposals for mergers and acquisitions.  This helps maintain the continuing viability of the beef farming industry in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I note the outcome of the European Commission's recent decision on this particular case. The proposal has been scrutinised in accordance with the well-established procedures under competition law rules, and amongst the factors taken into account by the European Commission was the impact this merger would have upon competition in the beef and lamb sectors.  My Department wrote to the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy some time ago and provided statistical industry data in response to a questionnaire which came from DG Competition. </p>  <p>  In this particular case the analysis and decision was under-taken by the EU Commission as per EU competition law, based on the combined turnover of the entities to be merged.  </p>  <p>  The vulnerable position of farmers in the supply chain is widely recognised and it was for this reason that we legislated earlier this year for the establishment of Producer Organisations in the beef sector.  I have also proposed to make an amendment to our Rural Development Programme which would introduce support for such organisations to improve farmers' bargaining power in the beef supply chain.  Recognition as a producer organisation will give farmers the right to bargain collectively with factories, outside normal competition rules, strengthening their hand and allowing for a more predictable and stable supply rate, which will be of benefit to both producers and factories. </p>  <p>  Through the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the State has an existing and well-established infrastructure for the oversight of competition issues and for dealing with allegations of anti-competitive practices or the abuse of a dominant market position. </p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate that if there is evidence  of practices by this or any other entity which are contrary to competition rules, the possibility of the matter being taken up with the relevant Competition Authorities remains open.</p></reply>

Exporters are also required to comply with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport.  It is  imperative therefore to ensure that the transport of greyhounds over long distances is conducted in a manner which safeguards the welfare of animals being transported and minimises the risk of transmitting infectious diseases.  Bord na gCon is responsible for the regulation of the greyhound industry and the well-being of greyhounds in Ireland.  The Bord has developed a comprehensive Code of Practice on the welfare of greyhounds which sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  The code emphasises that owners and keepers take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have met with representatives of Bord na gCon and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum (represented in Ireland by the ISPCA and Dogs Trust) to consider all issues relating to the export of greyhounds. Officials have used the opportunity to emphasise that the well-being of greyhounds, including their physical and social environment, is at the core of Ireland's greyhound industry and the need for the industry to comply with the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the associated Code of Practice which sets out clearly specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  A number of airlines have also introduced a policy not to transport greyhounds and Bord Na gCon (BnG) has reiterated its advice to all owners involved in the export of greyhounds to only export to destinations that provide the expected levels of care and management as defined in BnG's Code of Practice for the welfare of greyhounds.  I fully endorse this view.  I have no proposal to amend the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 at this time.</p></reply>

This meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.   </p>  <p>  At that meeting, I outlined that one of my priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Support Loan Fund.  Developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150m, it will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.   Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.  This loan product is aimed at alleviating the pressures of income volatility and will enable farmers to improve the management of their cash flow and reduce the cost of their short term borrowings.  </p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payment would be made this year in respect of Basic Payment and Greening Payment scheme.  Advance payment commenced on the 17th October, the earliest possible date by which payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.  By the end of last week some &euro;735 million had been paid out to 112,922 farmers and these payments are ongoing. </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  </p>  <p>  I stressed at the meeting also and want to restate my view that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry, to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.</p></reply>

Current FAO estimates are that world consumption of fish will grow by an average annual consumption of 17 kg per person, per annum, resulting in a requirement for an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Seafood will also benefit from the shift in global economic gravity towards the East, where there is a strong cultural preference for seafood. </p>  <p>  To avail of this opportunity, Food Wise identifies 6 areas where we need to focus our efforts in the years ahead.  We must put sustainability at the heart of everything we do, add value to our raw material, develop scale in our processing sector, upskill our seafood workforce, increase our raw material supply and develop our markets.</p>  <p>  In January this year, my predecessor Minister Coveney launched Ireland's new &euro;240 million Operational Programme under the European maritime and Fisheries Fund.  This new investment programme will be the source of very significant investment supports for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020.  The Programme represents a doubling of previous support levels.</p>  <p>  The Programme aims to support the seafood industry in meeting the challenges of the CFP and in sustainably growing production, value and employment in the seafood industry.  The Programme will focus precisely on the same 6 areas identified in Food Wise and will be instrumental in our efforts to develop and adapt our seafood industry to take advantage of the economic and employment opportunities to come.  </p>  <p>  The Programme is providing some &euro;67 million for our fishing sector, &euro;30 million for our aquaculture sector and &euro;30 million for our seafood processing sector.  A further &euro;12 million is being made available to significantly grow the Fisheries Local Action Group initiative to foster economic activity in fishing communities and some &euro;10 million is available for blue growth and marine spatial planning initiatives.  </p>  <p>  The majority of support schemes under the Programme are already underway in 2016, with a small number to follow in early 2017.  I expect that in the region of &euro;20 million will be invested under the Programme in 2016 and I have secured a significant increase to &euro;43 million in 2017.</p></reply>

There are many factors that impact on the rotation length such as: species, site productivity, thinning regime, market requirements and site constraints.</p>  <p>  Until recently the majority of clearfelling has been concentrated in the public estate.  A significant portion of the private forest estate, particularly conifers, that were afforested in the 1980s and the early 1990s are now approaching a stage where forest owners may be considering the timing of felling operations.  In addition the storm damage of February 2014, and strong market demands have led to increased levels of clearfelling in the private estate, where an entire standing group of trees is removed from an area in one operation. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, it is generally accepted that rotation lengths should be geared towards ensuring that the regional and national growth potential is not reduced and that each forest stand is managed to achieve its maximum production potential.  Where there has been a continuous and substantial annual increase in the forest area, only the most exploitative policies will compromise sustained future production and capacity for carbon sequestration.  The issue therefore focuses on the general principle of rotation lengths that will provide a good return to the grower, consistent with the principle of sustained yield.  Exceptions to normal practice usually involve the replacement of unproductive stands with a more productive crop, and the early felling of stands susceptible to windthrow in order to avoid technical problems and to reduce financial loss.</p>  <p>  In February 2016, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine initiated a project to Assess the impact of forest felling age on overall financial return.  The purpose of this work is to provide information to make growers and foresters aware of the possible impact of felling age on overall financial return.  The results of this work will be made available online through an interactive tool that allows forest owners and managers assess the optimum fell age of their forest.  Hardcopy results will also be available.  The provision of this information will inform forest owners and managers on the appropriate felling age, with a view to maximising the return on their investment.  It is vital that landowners have a positive experience from their forestry investments and that revenue from the first rotation facilitates reforestation to continue the forest cycle.</p></reply>

It is therefore necessary to eradicate TB in both species.  In view of this, the comprehensive TB Eradication Programme as implemented by my Department has incorporated a badger removal and population control policy since 2004.   </p>  <p>  The badger control policy is cost effective and has contributed very significantly to a substantial reduction in the incidence of TB both in cattle and in badgers in recent years: herd incidence in the bovine population has fallen by almost 40% from 5.9% in 2008 to 3.37% in 2015.  In addition, the cost of the TB eradication programme has fallen from &euro;57.2m to &euro;30.7m in the same period.  This improvement is attributable to a comprehensive range of measures, not least of which is the badger removal programme.  It should be noted that the incidence of bovine TB in Northern Ireland, where badger culling is not practised, is approximately twice as high as in this jurisdiction.   </p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of my Department is to incorporate badger vaccination into the Irish TB eradication programme and the current badger policy, including monitoring and research work, will make vaccination more effective in the future.  However, the vaccination strategy can only be deployed when data are available to ensure that this can be done in an effective and sustainable manner.  In view of this, various projects, involving vaccine development and oral-delivery techniques are under way (including a collaboration with the United Kingdom), with a view to developing a viable badger TB vaccination strategy.</p></reply>

More recently the EU Commission published its  ESR (Effort Sharing Regulation  and LULUCF which set out a binding commitment for each Member State and how the land use sector can be accounted. These proposals include the accounting rules which determine compliance.</p>  <p>  The LULUCF  proposal (Article 4) requires each MS to ensure that accounted CO2 emissions from specified land use categories are entirely compensated by an equivalent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere through removals in other categories.  This requirement  is referred to as the "no debit rule".  For example, if a Member State cuts down its forests and does not replant (deforestation), it must compensate the resulting emissions by removals in other land uses in the Irish case this is mainly in afforested lands or by net uptake in managed forest land, managed cropland or grasslands.  In this way the "no-debit" commitment incentivises Member States to take actions that increase the absorption of CO2 in agricultural soils and forests.</p>  <p>  Under the proposed ESR there is flexibility for Member States to use net removals from afforested and deforested land, cropland and grassland to meet emissions reduction targets.  In Ireland's case the proposal caps this contribution at 2.7 million tonnes/annum. </p>  <p>  Within this context the Department's afforestation scheme  plays an important role in climate change mitigation.  The Forestry Programme 2014&ndash;2020 sets out annual planting targets for the 6-year period where the aim is to establish 43,410 hectares of new forest by 2020. In terms of total forest cover the target is 18% by 2050. </p>  <p>  Coillte also has a significant role to play in helping Ireland achieve its emission targets.  The company will continue its programme of reforestation following harvest, thereby contributing to carbon sequestration over the longer term.  It will also work with my Department in implementing a viable afforestation model.  Coillte continues to play a key leadership role in delivering renewable energy solutions to industry by providing long term, secure biomass fuel supply contracts to large energy users thorough regional biomass supply hubs.  The company's biomass sales business thereby contributes to decarbonising the Irish economy by providing a sustainable and natural substitute for fossil fuels.  The company is also active in other renewable areas which will contribute to renewable energy targets with the company's land solutions business on track to deliver electricity to over 300,000 homes by 2017.   </p>  <p>  Medite SmartPly, Coillte's panels manufacturing business, as one of the largest users of power in the country, has an important responsibility to reduce its reliance on traditional energy sources.  Wood-based panels as used in the built environment and elsewhere are an important carbon store in their own right.   </p>  <p>  Coillte advise that it will take a leadership position in shaping policy around the role that forests and forest products will play in climate change mitigation and will be at the forefront of global and European developments.  An example of the company assuming a leadership role in this area was its hosting of the Climate Change and Irish Forestry Conference in  Dublin earlier this year, on 29 February, 2016.  The conference brought together representatives to address the risks and opportunities that climate change and its mitigation presents to the Irish forest sector.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of resources is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p><p>The area referred to by the Deputy is covered by both the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division and DMR North Division.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the current Garda strength in those Divisions was 671 and 675, respectively.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is also supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation), and the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of which 50 have been assigned to the DMR West and 41 have been assigned to the DMR North.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.  It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>This accelerated recruitment of trainee Garda is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Garda Divisions within the Fingal area, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p></reply>

No. 507 of 2016, will be making the reports referred to by the Deputy on the regulation, monitoring, operation and impact of multi-disciplinary practices in the State.  The timing and submission procedures for these reports are clearly defined under section 119 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 which will be commenced shortly to facilitate the work which the new Authority is required to do, and to which I would refer the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Under section 119(1) of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, the Authority shall, not later than six months following its establishment day, make an initial report to the Minister for Justice and Equality which will provide information in relation to MDPs in other jurisdictions and on the likely consequences and impacts of the operation of MDPs in Ireland as set out in section 119(2).  The Regulatory Authority will then, under section 119(3) engage in a public consultation process on the matters covered by its initial report and make a final report.  The final report will have regard to the information contained in the initial report and any submissions received under the public consultation process and will also set out the recommendations of the Authority in relation to the establishment, regulation, monitoring and operation of multi-disciplinary practices in the State.  This final report has to be made by the Authority to the Minister not later than six months after the making of the initial report. </p>  <p>  Under section 119(5) of the 2015 Act the Minister shall cause copies of the initial report and the final report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 30 days of its receipt - this procedure will be followed when the reports are duly made.  The Legal Services Regulatory Authority held its inaugural meeting yesterday which represents a historic watershed in the independent regulation of the legal professions.  I am, therefore, confident that the reports on multi-disciplinary practices to which the Deputy has referred will be addressed by the Authority, within the statutory time-frames laid out, as a key component of its initial programme of work. </p></reply>

However, I can confirm to the Deputy that the Chairperson of GSOC wrote to me seeking access to certain records of the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation.  In view of the provisions of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 concerning confidentiality of evidence given before a Commission of Investigation, I sought the advice of the Attorney General on the matter.  Having received the Attorney General's advice I wrote to the Chairperson of GSOC pointing out that access to the records in question can be sought through an application to court for an order directing that the material be provided.  It is now a matter for GSOC how to proceed.</p>  <p>  While the granting of any such order is a matter for the Courts, I will, of course, comply with any such court order. </p>  <p>  So, while there are legal steps to be gone through in order to seek access to the records in questions they are not necessarily legal impediments.  Those steps are necessary, as the Deputy will be aware, to protect the integrity of the proceedings of Commissions of Investigation, in particular where evidence is given in private.</p>  <p>  Therefore, it seems to me that the best approach at present is to allow the current procedures to continue.  If they prove deficient then the issue can be looked at to see how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

Under section 20 it must prepare three-yearly strategic plans while under section 28 it must submit annual estimates of income and expenditure.  The Authority must also submit annual accounts for audit and scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General and those accounts, along with the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Legal Services Regulatory Authority will also be held accountable under the specific responsibilities which are conferred in this area by the 2015 Act on its Chief Executive.  These arise under the respective provisions of sections 28, 29 and 30 to which I would refer the Deputy.  In addition to keeping all proper and usual accounts of moneys received and spent by the Authority, the Chief Executive shall, when requested, attend before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to give account for the general administration of the Authority.  The Chief Executive will also give evidence, whenever required in writing, to the Public Accounts Committee on the regularity and propriety of transactions, the economy and sufficiency of the use of resources, the systems, procedures and practices employed for evaluating the effectiveness of operations or any other matter relating to these that may be raised in a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that section 11 of the 2015 Act sets out the circumstances in which a member of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority may be disqualified from office.  Section 12 sets out a number of circumstances in which the Government may decide to remove a member of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority from office by reference to ill health, stated misbehaviour, conflict of interest or being otherwise unfit to hold the office or unable to discharge its functions. </p>  <p>  The Legal Services Regulation Act of 2015, therefore, contains an array of oversight and accountability measures of application to public bodies.  These apply to the work of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority as an independent statutory regulator including in terms of the functions of its members and of its chief executive.  I might add that the Authority will also be subject to the extensive code of practice, under a range of different governance headings, for the Governance of State bodies which has most recently been updated in August of this year.</p></reply>

The introduction of two thresholds provides an incentive to develop blended solid fuels with a higher biomass content.  To further the environmental rationale, this relief is available only for low smoke solid fuels.</p></reply>

While it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in light of available resources and as part of the annual budgetary process, owing to the particular severity of Sligo's financial situation my Department entered into regular consultations with the Council.  This process resulted in Sligo County Council identifying areas where savings could be made and the putting in place of a formal long-term Financial Plan in December 2015. </p>  <p>  In support of the work undertaken by Sligo, my Department committed to providing financial support to the Council of &euro;1 million per annum on condition that annual surplus targets were achieved. </p>  <p>  Sligo's Financial Plan is subject to periodic reviews by my Department. Review meetings have taken place between my Department and the Council during 2016 and further engagement is envisaged.  On 3 October 2016, my Department agreed adjustments to the implementation schedule in respect of the Financial Plan.  A reduction in the 2016 savings target has been agreed with related adjustments to be made in respect of later years.  These changes, which relate to taxation, enterprise support and the timing of retirements and career breaks, have enabled the local authority to comply with the financial plan.  Additional funding of &euro;1 million on an annual basis is made available to Sligo where it demonstrates compliance with the plan in that year.  This additional funding provides Sligo with a greater degree of flexibility and enables it to consider a wider range of resourcing requirements.  However, in accordance with section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, it is a matter solely for Sligo County Council to prioritise and allocate its resources, including any additional funding, to address its requirements, including in relation to the library service.  My Department has not been prescriptive in this regard.   </p>  <p>  In December 2010, following engagement with Donegal County Council as regards its financial planning, my Department sanctioned a loan of &euro;48.6 million to be used by the Council in respect of financial restructuring, subject to the carrying out of periodic financial reviews by my Department.  There are no resources available that could be used to provide additional funding to Donegal County Council.</p></reply>

To date almost 2,400 people have availed of the DMA MABS service.</p>  <p>  MABS has also established a national network of court mentors to attend each listed repossession Court hearing nationwide, to provide support to  distressed borrowers who are facing loss of their home, and signposting them to appropriate services. </p>  <p>  More recently, the Government has put in place a scheme called Abhaile to assist people who are insolvent and in mortgage arrears on their home to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance free of charge.  This scheme is designed to help them find the best possible solutions, with the priority being to support families to remain in their own homes.  MABS acts as the gateway for a person to access the appropriate professional advice under the scheme and operates a voucher system to facilitate that.  The scheme has been in operation since 22 July 2016 and almost 2,000 vouchers have been issued to date.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE, including, for example, advice from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. </p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi).  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its HTA and submitted it to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p><p>A summary of the HTA has been published on the NCPE website and is available at:<font color="#0000FF"> </font>.</p><p>The HSE has since had further engagements with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Orkambi.  The HSE is considering the outcome of these engagements and any other, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement. </p><p>In relation to the cost of new medicines, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 sets out the conditions by which new medicines can be added to the reimbursement lists for the community drugs schemes.  Before approving reimbursement of a new medicine the HSE is required to consider a number of criteria including: the potential or actual budget impact of a medicine, the cost-effectiveness of the medicine, the health needs of the public and the resources available to the HSE.  The HSE therefore undertakes a robust analysis of the pricing points of new medicines and this is factored into negotiations with manufacturers.  In the negotiation process the HSE will often seek significant price reductions so that medicines reimbursed are both cost-effective and affordable.</p><p>Under the new Framework Agreement on the Pricing and Supply of Medicines agreed between the State and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, medicines are now subject to an annual downward only price realignment.  The price realignment is now based on an basket of 14 countries; this has been extended from 9 and also includes more lower cost countries.  This will ensure that the State achieves better value for money on the cost of medicines as prices in the other reference countries are adjusted downwards over time.  It also ensures that the prices paid by Ireland are not out of line with the other 13 EU Member States.</p><p>The issue of affordability and access to new and innovative medicines represents a major challenge to the health service in Ireland and indeed to health systems internationally.  I have said previously that I am willing to examine, with the Oireachtas, new ways in which this challenge might be addressed.</p></reply>

From the outset the Government has been clear that it will not be possible to spend all of this revenue in 2017 due to timing factors.  However, I have also received approval for very significant additional capital expenditure on mental health services.  This has allowed for the award of the contract to construct a new Forensic Mental Health facility at Portrane.  The redevelopment of forensic mental health facilities was a key recommendation in "A Vision for Change: The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy" which was published in 2006.  Some &euro;50 million will be spent on this capital project next year, with the total cost of the project in excess of &euro;150 million. </p>  <p>  Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out of hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional revenue spend of &euro;9.7 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates.  The revenue allocation for Mental Health in 2017 will be &euro;851.3 million, an increase of &euro;24.7 million, or approximately 3%, over 2016.  This will be supplemented by a further &euro;50 million in capital funding.  Despite significant increase in the cost of the new National Forensic Mental Health facility since it was originally initiated in 2000, due mainly to price inflation in the construction sector, the capital provision made and the award of the construction contract will secure the long overdue modernisation of these services.</p></reply>

There is currently a worldwide shortage of BCG vaccine and the vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  The only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine.  The manufacturer has informed the HSE there will be no supply of BCG until 2017.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives. </p>  <p>  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply a decision will be made, guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, on who should be prioritised to receive the vaccine. </p>  <p>  I have not been informed of any difficulties in procuring supplies of any of the other vaccines referred to in the question.  However, as the procurement of vaccines is a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aim of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme 'A Fair Deal' is to enure that long term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone assessed as needing it, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  My reply to Parliamentary Question number 386 of 4 October 2016 outlined the financial contribution which participants in the Scheme make towards the cost of their care, regardless of whether they choose a public, private or voluntary care facility.  An individual financial assessment is carried out for each applicant to the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  My reply to Parliamentary Question 386 also described the many safeguards contained in the Scheme, one of which is to ensure that an applicant keeps a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  </p>  <p>  A further safeguard contained in the Scheme relates to certain items of expenditure known as allowable deductions which can be taken into account for the financial assessment, such as health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person's principal private residence, maintenance payments, and payments in respect of the maintenance of dependent children.</p>  <p>  Importantly, where an applicant's assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  This is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long term nursing home care.</p>  <p>  A list of Nursing Home Support Offices are provided on the HSE website.  An applicant's local Nursing Home Support Office will be in a position to provide information in relation to having a review of their  financial assessment.  This can take place if 12 months have passed since the initial financial assessment or the most recent review, or if the HSE is satisfied that there has been a material change to the person's financial circumstances.</p></reply>

This work is overseen by Government through a hierarchy of committees and sub-groups, with independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council, as appropriate.  These committees and groups include the Cabinet Committee and Senior Officials' Group on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, a Technical Research and Modelling Group and a Domestic Climate Finance Group. </p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, a National Mitigation Plan is being prepared.  Food Wise 2025 &ndash; the strategic plan for the sustainable development of agri-food sector over the next decade - provides a framework for the agri sector to engage with the national mitigation plan.  Food Wise builds on its predecessor and focuses on the continued growth in the value of Irish agri-food including dairy production. While this is likely to mean some increase in dairy numbers, it is not expected that there will be a significant increase in overall cattle numbers. </p>  <p>  There is a strong commitment in Food Wise 2025 to measure and monitor the sustainability credentials of the sector.  As part of the implementation of Food Wise, an Environmental Sustainability Committee has been established.  This implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department will continue to engage with research initiatives to further assist with the refinement, development and deployment of new and innovative practices to further reduce GHGs that are associated with agricultural production.</p></reply>

I met with a range of stakeholders in advance of the recent Budget and I have been engaged, both at National and EU level, to address the issues involved and to ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and resilient sector.  As part of the recent Budget, I announced a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; to alleviate the pressures of income volatility through:</p>  <p>  - Lower Cost Finance: I announced plans for an 'Agri Cashflow Support Loan' fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans at an interest rate of 2.95%, for amounts up to &euro;150,000 and for terms up to six years.</p>  <p>  - Tax Measures: I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance an adjustment to the current 'Income Averaging' system, allowing for an opt-out in an exceptional year.</p>  <p>  - Farm Payments: Spending on farm schemes through the Rural Development Programme will see &euro;601 million go directly to farmers in 2017, including a new &euro;25 million sheep welfare scheme and increased participation in GLAS, BDGP &amp;amp; TAMS.  his is on top of &euro;1.2 billion paid through the Basic Payments Scheme.</p>  <p>  Regarding the agri-food sector generally, the Food Wise 2025 strategy contains recommendations aimed at improving value-added and productivity at farm and food industry level through a focus on sustainability, efficiency, knowledge transfer and innovation.  Realising the ambitious growth projections set out in Food Wise will be challenging, particularly in the context of Brexit, but I am confident that the  strong implementation process for the strategy, led by the High Level Implementation Committee which I chair, will deliver results.</p>  <p>  Specifically on the cost of inputs, we will of course remain vigilant in the current market environment but the CSO's agricultural input price index decreased by 1.0% in August 2016 compared with July 2016 and decreased by 4.7% in the 12 months to the end of August.</p></reply>

Food Wise includes over 400 recommendations on cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.  Food Wise 2025 foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.  While realising this growth projection will be challenging following the UK referendum, a combination of diversification of markets and identifying opportunities in existing markets can deliver long term growth.   </p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success.  I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee on priorities for particular sectors or themes in enabling and delivering sustainable growth in investment and employment to benefit the agri-food sector.   </p>  <p>  Opening markets is a priority.  In 2015 my Department secured market openings for beef in USA, Canada, Iran, Oman and the Maldives, for sheepmeat and pigmeat in Oman and the Maldives, for pigmeat in South Africa.  Extended access to the Philippines market was also secured for beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat and this work continues in close cooperation with producers and industry.   </p>  <p>  The launch of the Bord Bia Thinking House in September now offers client companies access to cutting-edge global research and innovation resources.  This facility will be supported by an increase in the number of Bord Bia marketing specialists working in the areas of qualitative research, data mining and analysis, brand and innovation.  These complement the range of market promotion and quality services, specialist Bord Bia personnel available to companies and talent development programmes with a high retention rate within the industry.   </p>  <p>  In relation to meat, the Meat Technology Centre, hosted in Teagasc Food Research Centre, Ashtown, now establishes an internationally leading centre of excellence for meat processing research and innovation.  It will be market-led and informed by leading meat firm stakeholders and expert meat research capabilities through the technology cycle.  Ambitious plans and investment are underway also in relation to fisheries and seafood.   </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports food and drink companies to scale through investment, development of management capability, improving competitiveness and innovation.  This includes investments in building Dairy industry capability in the form of Food for Health Ireland (FHI), and the recently launched Dairy Processing Technology Centre.  Lean manufacturing and leadership programmes also enhance company capability.  Enterprise Ireland also works with international food companies as they develop their activities in Ireland, and seeks to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).  In the past three years Enterprise Ireland have approved funding of &euro;138m to the industry between 2013 and 2015.  This support leveraged an estimated investment of &euro;995m by the industry.</p></reply>

Ongoing commitment to this sector is underlined in the Food Wise 2025 report for the industry.  This action plan for the Agri-food sector contains over 400 recommendations and identifies many areas for growth in the tillage sector, particularly in the very important and successful distilling and craft brewing industries, high-end health foods and value-added niche foods and ingredients. </p>  <p>  I recently chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector.  This meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenging environment this year on tillage farms, I informed the meeting that I had directed my officials to prioritise the processing of all payments this year including the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), the areas of Natural Constraint Scheme, GLAS and AEOS which are in total worth over &euro;1.5 billion annually to the Agriculture Industry.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the BPS and Greening Payment, I was pleased to arrange for advance payments to commence on 17 October, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations.  By the end of last week, some &euro;735 million had been paid out to 112,922 farmers and these payments are ongoing. </p>  <p>  At the meeting with tillage stakeholders, I outlined that one of my priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Support Loan Fund.  Developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150m, it will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.  This loan product is aimed at alleviating the pressures of income volatility and will enable farmers to improve the management of their cash flow and reduce the cost of their short term borrowings.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 contains measures to support the establishment of Knowledge Transfer Groups across the main farming sectors.  A Knowledge Transfer Group for the Tillage sector is currently under way. </p>  <p>  An amendment to the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 also provides for the inclusion of a Tillage Scheme under the suite of measures provided under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme.  It is anticipated that the Tillage Scheme will open for applications in the near future.</p>  <p>  In addition to these specific recent initiatives, my Department operates ongoing schemes and programmes in relation to seed certification and crop variety evaluation.  These schemes ensure that only the best quality seed is available to growers and that Irish cereal yields remain among the highest in the world. </p>  <p>  The changing landscape of global arable production requires us to take a fresh look at our tillage industry, to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.</p></reply>

The last 18 months have been somewhat challenging particularly in the dairy and pigmeat sectors due to a number of factors.  These factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 and 2016 included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers including the EU on the supply side. </p>  <p>  The UK Brexit referendum is obviously foremost in our minds too and in Government it is very much our number one priority.  It is essential that we retain our national competitiveness as much as we possibly can while mitigating the effects of a possible disruptive exit by Britain from the EU.  The effects on our agri-food sector are already been felt by exporters hugely affected by the strengthening sterling rate against the Euro lately.  I am listening closely to what exporters have to say and as recently as Thursday last I chaired a meeting of a Stakeholder Forum for the agri-food sector which I established to focus on Brexit related issues.  This will continue to be my priority in the immediate future.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.  It is for this reason I led a major trade mission to four Asian Countries in September and why I will be leading another one to Algeria and Morocco next month.  It is only through further increasing our footprint internationally that we will help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential. </p>  <p>  There are a number of other initiatives at industry, national and EU level aimed at mitigating market volatility in the dairy sector.  The EU Commission has responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures provided for under the CAP.  Market difficulties continued into the middle of 2016 and the Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council in July.  The main component is a fund of &euro;500 million, which is in turn comprised of two elements. </p>  <p>  The first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure that will compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg).  In Phase 1 over 99% of available resources in terms of finances and tonnages were applied for.  In Ireland, this amounted to approximately 74.2 million kilos from approaching 4,500 producers.  If fully utilised, this will be worth over &euro;10m to Irish dairy producers.  Phase 2 of the scheme saw approaching 570 Irish suppliers apply for over 6 million kilos of reduction.  At EU level, Phase 2 of the scheme was highly oversubscribed, with approaching 100 million kilos worth of proposed reductions made for the approximate 12 million kilos remaining after Phase 1.</p>  <p>  The second element of the EU July 2016 package is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes, which Member States can use in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  As part of Budget 2017 I announced a new low cost loan fund for the livestock, including in particular dairy, as well as tillage sectors which will utilise Ireland's &euro;11.1M allocation, in conjunction with national funds, to leverage a greater fund in the region of &euro;150M to provide such a low cost loan model for Irish farmers.</p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong but there have been significant challenges this year.  I am confident that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand whilst simultaneously addressing the aforementioned challenges with a particular focus on the challenges of price volatility.</p></reply>

I am confident that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand whilst simultaneously addressing the aforementioned challenges with a particular focus on the challenges of price volatility.</p>  <p>  On the sheep sector, I am also aware profitability at farm level remains a challenge for all sheep farmers, including hill farmers.  My Department already has in place a number of schemes, including the BPS, GLAS, ANC and TAMS which make vital contributions to ensuring the continuing viability of hill farming. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the introduction of a scheme for sheep farmers under the Rural Development Programme with a budget of some &euro;25 million to be provided in Budget 2017.  This new Animal Welfare scheme for sheep, in addition to the existing supports available to sheep farmers under the BPS, GLAS, ANC and TAMS, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability and sustainability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In designing the scheme, I am aware of the different challenges facing sheep farmers in which different areas of sheep farming are carried out in Ireland.  I believe that this scheme will provide a lasting benefit to sheep farming and demonstrates and acknowledges the contribution sheep farming makes to the Agri-food sector in this country.  This scheme has been submitted to the European Commission for formal approval as part of Ireland's proposed second amendment to the Rural Development Programme.</p>  <p>  My role as Minister in relation to the beef sector is to create a policy and support environment that allows it to flourish in line with standard market principles and delivers the best possible returns for all participants in the sector.  I am guided in this context by the long-term sectoral development strategies as set out in Food Wise 2025 and I am confident that these initiatives, in conjunction with the Rural Development Programme, will lead to continued growth in terms of profitability and efficiency of the sector as whole.  The primary determinant of prices in any market is the relationship between supply and demand.  As with any Minister for Agriculture in the EU, I can have no role in beef prices in Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is a clear objective of mine to ensure that this sector continues to receive the necessary support to address the challenge of profitability within the sector.  In addition to the Basic Payment Scheme, a range of measures introduced under the Rural Development Programme helps to improve efficiency and profitability on farm and to support environmentally sustainable production.  This includes programmes such as TAMS, GLAS, Knowledge Transfer Groups and of course the Beef Data and Genomics Programme.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK's decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK. </p>  <p>  I am following up on this in a very real and practical way through my participation in an ambitious Trade Mission agenda, which is being rolled out in co-operation with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland.  For example, I led a very successful Trade Mission to China and Singapore in early September, at around the same time that my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle, was leading another very successful mission to Vietnam and Korea.  I will also be visiting Algeria and Morocco next week at the head of another very strong Trade Mission, and this will be followed by a visit to the Gulf region at the end of November.  It is also my intention to continue this activity through further strategically targeted visits in 2017, and I am of course also ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

Agri food exports account for 7% of GDP and continue to grow year on year.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays a vital role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Currently my Department has assisted our colleagues in the Department of Health on the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat and poultry into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April the first 2015.  This requires businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  The draft SI has been finalised and my Department has placed it on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States and following on from the obligatory three month standstill period I would be confident that the Minister for Health will be in a position to sign the SI, thereby bringing it into force.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the 'one step forward, one step backward' traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department. </p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission's Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance.  Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety's website.</p></reply>

This Committee met for the second time last week, and will continue to facilitate an ongoing exchange of dialogue with my Department as the situation in relation to Brexit unfolds.</p></reply>

Current FAO estimates are that world consumption of fish will grow by an average annual consumption of 17 kg per person, per annum, resulting in a requirement for an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Seafood will also benefit from the shift in global economic gravity towards the East, where there is a strong cultural preference for seafood.</p>  <p>  To avail of this opportunity, Food Wise identifies 6 areas where we need to focus our efforts in the years ahead.  We must put sustainability at the heart of everything we do, add value to our raw material, develop scale in our processing sector, upskill our seafood workforce, increase our raw material supply and develop our markets.</p>  <p>  In January this year, my predecessor Minister Coveney launched Ireland's new &euro;240 million Operational Programme under the European maritime and Fisheries Fund.  This new investment programme will be the source of very significant investment supports for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020.  The Programme represents a doubling of previous support levels.</p>  <p>  The Programme aims to support the seafood industry in meeting the challenges of the CFP and in sustainably growing production, value and employment in the seafood industry.  The Programme will focus on the same 6 areas identified in Food Wise and will be instrumental in our efforts to develop and adapt our seafood industry to take advantage of the economic and employment opportunities to come. </p>  <p>  The Programme is providing some &euro;67 million for our fishing sector, &euro;30 million for our aquaculture sector and &euro;30 million for our seafood processing sector.  A further &euro;12 million is being made available to significantly grow the Fisheries Local Action Group initiative to foster economic activity in fishing communities and some &euro;10 million is available for blue growth and marine spatial planning initiatives. </p>  <p>  The majority of support schemes under the Programme are already underway in 2016, with a small number to follow in early 2017.  I expect that in the region of &euro;20 million will be invested under the Programme in 2016 and I have secured a significant increase to &euro;43 million in 2017.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broaElamdband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  - The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p>  <p>  - The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p>  <p>  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Co Kerry.</p>  <p>  The maps shows that 44% of  Blennerville in the townland of Curragraigue (Trughanacmy) falls within the AMBER area and that the areas between the town of Blennerville and Camp in County Kerry falls largely within the AMBER area and will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process. </p>  <p>  The townland of Camp together with the remaining 56% of Blennerville in the townland of Curraghraigue (Trughanacmy) is included in the BLUE area where commercial providers are either currently delivering or previously indicated that they have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode. </p>  <p>  While I cannot compel any operator to provide services to a particular premises, my Department continues to actively monitor the deployment plans in the BLUE area and direct feedback from consumers is important.  In this regard, if customers in Camp  or Blennerville cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dcenr.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.</p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises in Ireland including over 51,000 premises in County Kerry covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been approximately 150 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.</p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. </p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-27a.485.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102700064#WRJ04200"><p>For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) No. 406/2009/EC.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.</p>  <p>  Regarding my Department's prediction as to the amount by which Ireland will miss its 2020 EU emissions target, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are the appropriate body to provide this detail.  In this context, in March 2016, the EPA published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland's emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6-11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013-2020, Ireland is projected to have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e).   </p>  <p>  The extent of this challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.   </p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities assigned to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to make a draft National Mitigation Plan available for public consultation by the end of the year followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.   </p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve the long-term vision of low carbon transition, set out in the National Policy Position, by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland's obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.</p></reply>

In 2015, the contribution of coal, natural gas and oil to gross electricity generation stood at 16.9%, 43% and 1.4% respectively.  </font>The Energy Policy Paper recognises that key decisions on the future of Moneypoint will have to be taken before 2020 as the station comes to the end of its operating life in its current configuration in 2025.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Programme for Government commits to reducing import dependency while maintaining energy security, affordability and reducing energy-related emissions.

In 2015, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that 25.3% of electricity was generated by renewable sources, of which 22.8% was generated by onshore wind. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that 9.1% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources and that this avoided &euro;286 million of fossil fuel imports.</font></p></reply>

This work involves dealing with issues of assessment' child protection' and children in care.  There were a further 4'727 children (open cases) who had been assessed as needing a dedicated social worker' and were waiting for one to be allocated.  Some of these cases may have had an allocated social worker.  However' maternity leave' sick leave and movement of staff within the service can result in a case being unallocated for a short period of time.  I wish to assure the Deputy that all urgent and emergency cases are dealt with immediately.  This could involve' for example' cases of abandonment' allegations of physical and sexual abuse' parental ill health and the need to find an immediate placement' or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party. </p><p>Tusla is currently implementing a three-year development plan which includes provision for extra staffing to meet critical service concerns such as addressing children with no allocated social worker.  The Government has provided significant additional resources to Tusla' and the Agency have been instructed to expedite the recruitment of staff to address such capacity concerns.  During 2016' Tusla has been active in developing its capacity to recruit and retain staff across its multi-disciplinary organisation and this will continue throughout 2017 with a particular focus on areas of highest need.</p><p>This Department continues to monitor the number of cases that are reported as awaiting the allocation of a social worker.  The additional funding of &euro;37 million which has been secured for Tusla in 2017 will provide increased resources to meet identified risks and service demands.

To cater for an expansion of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme would require significant capital investment to increase the capacity of the childcare sector.  In addition' this is likely to require an enormous volume of additional qualified staff. </p>  <p>  Currently the ECCE Programme is available for children from the age of three until they attend primary school' provided they are no older than five years and six months by the end of the pre-school year' (ie. end of June).  As all children must be in primary school by the age of six it would be impractical to extend the ECCE Programme beyond the current cut off point of five years and six months.  Therefore' if ECCE were to be provided for a third year the programme would need to be extended to children from the age of two.  The cost of childcare for children aged between one year of age' and two years of age is considerably higher than for children participating in ECCE' as a significantly higher ratio of staff to children is required (11:1 for current ECCE-age children' 5:1 for children between the ages of one and two-and-a-half in a sessional pre-school service).</p>  <p>  Given the complexities described above it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of cost.  The Department is currently in the process of procuring an independent review of the cost of care' following which the data required to enable an answer to this question may be available.</p></reply>

Notification of Ireland&rsquo;s transposition of the EU Directive on Preventing and Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings and Protecting its Victims was forwarded in July 2013.

My Department will then be in a position to proceed with its commitment to ratify the Protocol.</p>  <p>  While the Second Protocol has yet to be ratified' considerable provisions exist in Irish law to combat the sexual abuse or exploitation of children' including ensuring the necessary flow of information to the relevant authorities about child abuse.  </p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 and the respective Amendment Act of 2013 contain specific provisions to combat the exploitation' including sexual exploitation' of trafficked children.  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012' which makes it an offence to withhold information relating to the commission of certain arrestable offences (including certain sexual offences) against children' also forms part of the legislative protections for children.  Other relevant legislation in the area of reporting is the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 and the Children First Act 2015.</p></reply>
