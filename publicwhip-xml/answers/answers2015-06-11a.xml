This included clarification as to whether the selection process underway in Ireland was open to any interested entity submitting an expression of interest to be a Local Action Group under the new programme.  A response has now issued to the Commission clarifying matters which were raised in their correspondence. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the selection process which is underway for LEADER Local Development Strategies in Ireland is an open process and all interested entities were invited to submit an expression of interest to be a Local Action Group if they so wished.  I should say for the purposes of the new LEADER programme, there are 28 sub-regional areas in Ireland and on the closing date for submission of expressions of interest, 45 separate expressions of interest were received.  A single expression of interest has been received in 19 of the 28 areas and at least 2 expressions of interest have been received in the remaining 9 areas.   </p>  <p>  I expect that all the expressions of interest will be presented to an Independent Evaluation Committee for assessment and decision by late June.  On foot of this, preparatory support will be made available to all eligible Local Action Groups selected by the Committee.  The Groups will then be provided with a minimum of 6 months to develop their strategies.  The Independent Evaluation Committee will also assess and make the final decisions in relation to the quality of each local development strategy submitted in due course and where multiple strategies are submitted, it will be a matter for the Evaluation Committee to a make a decision on which local development strategy best meets the needs of the community.</p></reply>

Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  The greater Dublin area accounted for the bulk of that growth, with 4,427 units completed.  In Quarter 1 2015, a total of 652 units were completed in the four Dublin local authority areas, an increase of 28% on the same period in 2014.</p><p>A range of measures are being taken to support increased housing delivery.  In particular, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 which was published last week, provides for changes in development contributions and in relation to Part V.  In addition, the Bill provides for the introduction of a vacant site levy. </p><p>With regard to social housing provision, the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>sets out ambitious targets for delivery to 2020, with delivery in the Dublin area being driven by a dedicated Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce.  On 1 April, Minister Kelly and I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities, to meet an ambitious delivery target of 22,883 social housing units out to 2017.  Within this, the combined funding total for the Dublin local authorities comes to over &euro;500 million.  As part of the delivery under this &euro;500m programme for Dublin, &euro;117m was allocated to the four Dublin local authorities on 5 May in respect of 19 build projects, which will see the development of 566 new units of accommodation.  I expect further approvals to be announced in the coming months.</p><p>In addition, nearly &euro;6m has been allocated to the 4 Dublin local authorities to bring 345 properties back into use this year and over &euro;15m has been provided for Dublin across a range of other housing schemes, including works to improve housing for people with disabilities, as well as retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency.</p></reply>

While fees for professional services are determined by market forces and are therefore outside the scope of my regulatory powers, my Department has recently prepared a <i>Sample Preliminary Inspection Plan for a Single Unit Dwelling on a Single Development</i>which has been subject to a recent public consultation exercise undertaken as part of a general review of SI No. 9 of 2014 during its first twelve months in operation.  A copy of this plan and all other documents released as part of the public consultation process are available on my Department's website at </p><p>Cost calculations published to accompany the Sample Preliminary Inspection Plan demonstrate that the new Assigned Certifier role can be achieved at a n approximate cost of &euro;3,800 incl. VAT.  Where additional design work is required the combined cost of Assigned Certifier duties and additional design work will be of the order of &euro;6,000 incl. VAT.</p><p>The arrangements in respect of self-built, one-off houses form an essential element of a full review of the broader operation of S.I. No. 9 of 2014.  Some 170 submissions have been received during the public consultation stage of this review process which concluded on 15 May 2015.  These submissions are currently being considered and my Department will produce a report on the matter by end June 2015 with a view to ensuring that any measures required can be put in place as a matter of priority.</p></reply>

Any person regarded as homeless by a housing authority may be placed into temporary emergency accommodation, which the housing authority may arrange itself or which may be operated by a State-funded service provider, without the requirement to undergo a social housing assessment and be approved for social housing supports.</p>  <p>  I am not considering any amendment to the existing arrangements.  I believe that they give housing authorities the flexibility that is essential to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of cases that may present to them.  I am satisfied that local authorities make every reasonable effort to address the accommodation needs of those individuals and families presenting as homeless, supported by significant resources provided by my Department.  In that regard, some &euro;55.5m is being provided for homelessness services this year, some &euro;10.5m more than the initial allocation in 2014. </p>  <p>  Addressing issues in relation to homelessness will continue to be a top priority for me and my Department, working with local authorities and service providers.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each local authority to identify the appropriate initiatives to respond to their housing need, including consideration by them of options to acquire available properties, new building developments, leasing and the provision of housing supports through the private rental sector.  A breakdown has been provided to local authorities in relation to their targets as between capital-funded and current-funded units.  </p><p>The estimated cost to the Exchequer for the delivery of the additional 35,000 new units to be delivered under the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>to 2020 is &euro;3.8 billion.  The funding provided through Budget 2015 will provide the required kick start to the delivery of the targets in the Strategy and I am confident that my announcement of over &euro;1.5 billion for the delivery of the targets out to 2017 will meet the full delivery cost of these units.</p></reply>

There is now just one remaining measure under the RAPID programme, which accounts for unpaid commitments, namely the sports capital top-ups.  In 2015, I allocated funding of &euro;500,000 for sports capital projects under the programme and these are being jointly funded with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

Details of monitoring requirements along with the procedures to be followed and the roles of water suppliers, the EPA and the HSE, where there is non-compliance with the parametric values set out in the Schedules to the Regulations, are clearly laid out in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system.  Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the main stopcock to the house and within the house therefore rests with the homeowner.  In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time. </p>  <p>  Earlier this week the Government approved a National Strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water.  The Strategy was prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health, Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA, in order to map the scale of the problem and identify measures to mitigate any risks to human health posed by lead in drinking water.  As part of the Strategy I will be establishing a new grant scheme to assist low income households to replace lead pipes in their home.  The scheme will be administered by local authorities and in line with Drinking Water regulations, the available resources will be prioritised to areas of highest risk.  Funding for this measure in 2016 will be finalised in the context of Budget 2016.</p></reply>

It reported that rents nationally were 8.2% higher than in the first quarter of 2014, down from the 10.4% annual increase recorded in mid-2014.  While the report recorded a slow-down in rent inflation in Dublin, this was offset by an increase in the surrounding counties.</p><p>These trends are broadly in line with the most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) whose rent index is based on actual rents paid as opposed to the asking price.  The PRTB data shows that in the fourth quarter of 2014, rents were 5.8% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2013.  Dublin, however, was seeing the highest rates of increase nationally with rents there higher by 9.6% over the same period, although the rate of annual increase was down slightly. </p><p>A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts.  <i>Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed.  <i>Construction 2020</i>also commits to identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development.</p><p>Addressing the supply shortfall in housing will take time but in the period since the publication of <i>Construction 2020</i>, some welcome signs of recovery in the sector have become evident.  Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  The latest figures for new house completions show that 2,629 units were completed in the first three months of 2015, up 26% on the corresponding figure for the first quarter 2014.</p><p>Social housing is a key priority for the Government, evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in Budget 2015 and the publication of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>in November 2014.  The total targeted provision under the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units through Pillar 1.  The private rental sector, through Pillar 2 of the strategy, will accommodate up to 75,000 eligible low-income households primarily through the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  Social housing targets have been set for each local authority out to 2017 and are available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) report <i>Ireland's Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply</i>, which was published last month, is a welcome and timely contribution to the debate around the rental sector.  The report calls for more secure occupancy for tenants, including greater rent certainty as well as measures to increase the supply of rental housing.  The recommendations put forward in this report will be considered carefully in the context of framing any measures in relation to the rental market.  My overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

Specifically, the Government will provide &euro;399m in operating subvention to Irish Water in 2015.

The letter indicates that while this may lead to a funding requirement of less than the amounts agreed by Government, they cannot lead to the position where there would be an expectation of increased Government subvention.

However, in order to get the most accurate data relating to the numbers applying for social housing support, the Government's <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>, published in November 2014, includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the summary of social housing assessments by undertaking it on annual basis from 2016 onwards.</p><p>The 2013 Summary results were analysed by the Housing Agency and on the basis of the certain assumptions and having regard to housing support mechanisms including the roll-out of the Housing Assistance Payment, a requirement was identified for an additional 35,000 properties for social housing. </p><p>The targeted provision in the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand. </p><p>The Strategy will be delivered in two phases.  Phase 1 targets the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units and 32,400 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units, by the end of 2017.  In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the delivery of 17,000 additional units and 43,000 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units.  In addition, the implementation of the range of actions under <i>Construction 2020</i>will support increased supply in the wider housing market. </p><p>Earlier this year my Department requested and received proposals from all local authorities on their planned delivery of new social housing units out to 2017.  In that context, on 5 May I announced the first phase of a major social housing construction investment programme, with a value of &euro;312 million, covering all 31 local authorities and with over 1,700 housing units to be built across some 100 separate projects. </p><p>Local authorities are responsible for the detailed planning of social housing provision based on the needs of their areas.  It is a matter for each local authority to identify the appropriate initiatives to respond to their housing need, including consideration by them of options in respect of new building developments, property acquisition, leasing and the provision of housing supports through the private rental sector.</p></reply>

The overall strategic objective of the Government's housing strategy is to enable all households access good quality housing appropriate to household circumstances and in their particular community of choice.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government published the comprehensive <i>Construction 2020</i>Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector in May 2014 aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any critical bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed.  The Strategy incorporates 75 specific actions encompassing the development of an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision.</p><p>My Department takes the lead on a range of actions under <i>Construction 2020</i>relating to housing and planning, including the publication of the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>in November 2014 and two significant pieces of legislation.</p><p>The Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill, aimed primarily at addressing the current housing supply shortage situation, providing for the revision of the Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing; retrospective application of reduced development contribution charges; the introduction of a vacant site levy to incentivise urban regeneration and the provision of housing in central urban areas, was published last week.  This Bill is targeted for enactment before the summer recess.</p><p>The Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill provides for the primary planning-related recommendation of the Mahon Tribunal, namely the establishment of a new Office of the Planning Regulator; a legislatively defined approach to the development of a successor strategy to the 2002 National Spatial Strategy - the National Planning Framework - and enhanced transparency in, and streamlining of, the planning system.  This Bill is due to be brought to Government seeking approval to publish before the summer recess.</p><p><i>Construction 2020</i>seeks to realign housing demand and supply and promote stability in the sector.  We are already beginning to see some welcome and positive signs of recovery in the sector.  Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure. </p><p>Furthermore, the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>was developed under Action 8 of <i>Construction 2020</i>and is a key component in the delivery of social housing infrastructure.  The targeted social housing provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  Importantly, the Strategy restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing.</p><p>The Strategy will be delivered in two phases.  Phase 1 targets the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units and 32,400 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units, by the end of 2017.  In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the delivery of 17,000 additional units and 43,000 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units. </p><p>With regard to monitoring progress, effective on-going cross-Government coordination is essential for the successful delivery of all actions included in both Strategies.  My colleague, Minister of State Coffey has special responsibility for Housing, Planning and Coordination of Construction 2020 and the implementation of the Strategy is overseen by the Construction 2020, Housing Planning and Mortgage Arrears Cabinet sub-Committee, which is chaired by An Taoiseach. </p><p>Likewise, the Social Housing Strategy has a clear governance structure in place to drive and oversee measured output and outcomes.  The Strategy is clear, measurable and targeted to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  In order to do that, Ministers Coffey and I co-chair a high level Oversight Group where all key delivery agents from my Department, local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and Social Protection are represented. </p><p>Since the Strategy was published details of over &euro;1.5 billion for building, purchase and leasing schemes, to accommodate 25% of the housing list by 2017, has been announced and <b>&euro;312m</b>was approved for the first tranche of building <b>1,700</b>social housing units.  The projects will have a knock on effect of creating approximately <b>3,000</b>jobs in construction.  As more projects are approved there will be a series of further announcements.  The Government is committed to ensuring that every household will have access to secure, good quality housing suited to their needs at an affordable price in a sustainable community.</p></reply>

As a private company, my Department has no role or function in its operations.</p><p>However, in the context of the pyrite remediation scheme, an agreement was reached between the Pyrite Resolution Board and HomeBond in June 2014 under which HomeBond has agreed to contribute technical and project management services to the Board to the value of &euro;2 million.  Such services include assisting in organising and managing t he testing of dwellings and project management of remediation contracts.  HomeBond has also agreed to make available to the Pyrite Resolution Board/Housing Agency the results of testing undertaken by it prior to the operation of the scheme.</p><p>As matters stand, over 730 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme and the Board will continue to accept applications from homeowners, and will continue to remediate dwellings, subject to those applications meeting the eligibility criteria of the scheme.</p></reply>

This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014. </p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  The Government has no plans to change this policy.  In fact, the Government increased payments for certain pensioners by increasing the rate of the Living Alone Allowance in Budget 2015 to &euro;9.00. </p>  <p>  This increases the maximum personal rate of the State non-contributory pension for a qualified person living alone to &euro;228 per week, and the maximum rate for the contributory pension to &euro;239.30, when both the basic pension and the allowance are taken into account. </p>  <p>  The most recent change in the core rate of State pensions was in Budget 2009, when the State pension contributory was increased by 3.1% to &euro;230.30, and the non-contributory pension by 3.3% to &euro;219.00.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, and there are also payments for dependant adults which attracted similar increases at that time. </p>  <p>  Core pension rates have not been reduced in the life of this Government, despite significant pressures on Exchequer spending.  The same period has seen considerable deflation which has protected core pension rates in real terms from erosion by inflation.  This has had the effect of protecting older people from poverty.  CSO figures show that those over 65 are significantly less likely to be at risk of poverty or deprivation than those aged under 65. </p>  <p>  The recovery has also allowed us some leeway to increase spending in targeted areas, which is why I was able to restore a partial Christmas Bonus benefitting over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total. </p>  <p>  Any decision to increase pension rates would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

In 2012 the average processing time reduced to 33.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 28.5 weeks.  As at the end of May 2015, the average time taken to process a carer's allowance appeal has reduced further to 21.7 weeks, a reduction of 17.1 weeks since 2011. </p>  <p>  The reduction in processing time reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  In addition the Department has undertaken a process of reform in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing the time taken to respond to requests for submissions in relation to appeals.  The response time to requests for submissions to the Department for appeals of carer's allowance has reduced from an average of 17.9 weeks in 2011 to 14 weeks at end May 2015.</p>  <p>  Processing times are calculated from the registration date to the date of finalisation and include time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant and time in the Department for review and preparation of its appeal submission, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p>  <p>  Appeal processing times are kept under continual review in the Social Welfare Appeals Office and every effort is made to reduce processing times.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

This was a once-off call for pilot projects.  The purpose of the Ballymun Youth Guarantee (BYG) pilot project was to test key elements to inform the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee.  The project officially finished on the 31st December 2014.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people, who become unemployed, in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.  There are additional planned measures that have not yet been fully implemented.  Those under 18 are offered second chance education, e.g., through Youthreach.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee national roll-out will progress throughout 2015. There will be flexibility to tailor approaches to meet local conditions.  The specific approach to be followed in each area will be a matter for local DSP management working together with relevant stakeholders, including employer groups, community groups and training providers.  It is expected that this approach will be informed by the lessons learned from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee project, rather than requiring further pilot exercises.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee is focused in the first instance on the young unemployed in receipt of jobseekers payments, and involves the conditionality related to such payments in respect of jobsearch, availability for work, and willingness to take up appropriate offers of employment or opportunities on training and temporary employment programmes.</p>  <p>  Young people in receipt of non-Live Register payments (for example lone parents and people with disabilities) are entitle to benefit from the full range of services and programmes that are available to those on job-seekers' payments.  They are not however subject to the same conditionality in terms of willingness to engage with those services.</p></reply>

Specific criteria were set down in respect of the areas which should be included within the remit of the Living City Initiative which were required to be taken into account by the relevant city councils when putting forward the proposed Special Regeneration Areas for each city. </p>  <p>  As the Living City Initiative is a very targeted urban regeneration incentive, the criteria to be met for the inclusion of an area in the scheme are more stringent than simply being located in the relevant city and constructed pre 1915.  In particular, it was stated that the Special Regeneration Areas should be inner city areas which are largely comprised of dwellings built before 1915, where there is above average unemployment and which demonstrate clear evidence of neglect, dereliction and under-use.  It was specified that areas which are generally regarded as affluent, have high occupancy rates and which do not require regeneration should not be included in the Special Regeneration Areas. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that I do not see this as a wide-spread Initiative, as it is targeted at those areas which are most in need of attention.

It should be noted that as solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.</p>  <p>  When introducing the carbon tax I was acutely aware of the impact it would have on the price of fuel.  Taking the above into consideration I did not commence the application of carbon tax to solid fuels until a regulation was developed and introduced ensuring that all bituminous coal contained less than 0.7% sulphur.  Further to allowing for the development of that arrangement when the carbon tax on solid fuel commenced it was introduced on a phased basis over 2 years.</p>  <p>  My officials and officials from Revenue meet with the Solid Fuel Traders Group on a ongoing basis.  More recently, these meetings have been largely to discuss the development of a relief from carbon tax on the biomass element of solid fuel.  </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for collecting solid fuel carbon tax (SFCT), advise me that while there is no reliable estimate of the value of the shadow economy in the solid fuel sector, they are very aware of the risk of such activity, particularly given the price differentials with Northern Ireland and the absence of controls for tax purposes on cross-border supplies.  The application of the tax is heavily dependant on the regulatory regime for coal put in place by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2011.  This regulatory regime establishes higher environmental standards for coal supplied in the State compared with Northern Ireland, and provides for enforcement of those standards by the local authorities.  Suppliers who produce or supply solid fuels in contravention of the coal regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State agencies charged with preventing such supply. Revenue liaises with these bodies, as required, to ensure that lawful supplies of solid fuels are properly taxed.  The coal regulations provide also for the establishment of a register of coal suppliers by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioners that solid fuel traders who make taxable supplies of solid fuel are obliged to register with them for tax purposes and SFCT is subject to the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes.  In circumstances where there are grounds to believe that tax due has not been paid, Revenue investigates the suspect person's tax liabilities and collects any unpaid tax, including unpaid income tax, SFCT and VAT, together with any interest or penalties due. </p>  <p>  As part of its work against the shadow economy, Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group (HEMG) to facilitate the reporting of information by traders through their representative associations.  Solid fuel traders who suspect, or have evidence, that illegal and/or untaxed solid fuel is being sold in their area should report any information to their local authority and Revenue.  Revenue has held a number of meetings with suppliers on matters relating to untaxed supplies of solid fuel and, in common with all such reports, the information received is treated confidentially and is investigated fully for evidence of unpaid tax liabilities.</p></reply>

The fact that this Government has maintained such a progressive and redistributive tax and social welfare system during one of the most difficult fiscal consolidations in the history of the State demonstrates its commitment to equality and fairness.  ESRI research shows that Budgets 2009-2015 in aggregate had neither a progressive nor a regressive pattern and that losses due to budgetary policy were highest for those in the top ten percent of the income distribution followed by those in the bottom ten percent. </p>  <p>  Looking at the budgetary decision making process, the Cabinet handbook requires a statement on the likely effects of the decision sought on gender equality, people with disabilities and persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion to be included in Memoranda to Government. Consequently, Government does consider each of these important issues at an individual policy or programme level. </p>  <p>  With regard to the international taxation of corporate profits, this is something which is of concern to my Department who have been engaging on this issue at a supranational level through the BEPS initiative.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would emphasise that the Department of Finance is committed to engaging with developing countries to assist them in increasing their domestic tax revenues in ways that are more efficient, fairer, and better promote good governance and equity was stated in October 2013 in "Ireland's International Tax Strategy".  Further, Ireland's "One World, One Future" policy for international development commits to an all-of-government approach to international development.  This project also reflects a growing international interest in the subject of how tax systems may impact on the economies of developing countries.</p></reply>

The changes introduced in Finance Act 2014 do not prevent a foreign-incorporated company that is centrally managed and controlled in the State being resident in the State for tax purposes.</p>  <p>  The change in Ireland's company residence rules applies directly to companies incorporated on or after 1 January 2015.  For companies incorporated in the State before this date, the change will come into effect after 31 December 2020.  This transition period was provided to give existing groups of companies that continue to have substantial operations in Ireland a reasonable timeframe within which to reorganise their business structures to take account of the change.  However, where there is a change in ownership of a company before or after a major change in the conduct of the business of the company, the transition period will not apply and the new residence rules will apply from the date of the change of ownership of the company. </p>  <p>  The new residence rules are expected to principally affect companies that do not have any Irish operations within the charge to corporation tax - their only link with Ireland being their incorporation here.  There should not be any loss of corporation tax revenues in respect of such companies.  Those companies may also be part of multinational groups of companies with associated companies which do have substantive operations in Ireland and which pay corporation tax.  It is not anticipated that there will be any significant change in the activities which those associated companies undertake in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The residence rules change is part of a package of measures which was announced on Budget day 2014 in the new Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness, which is intended to increase the substantive Irish operations of foreign-owned and indigenous companies.  While it is not possible to predict how all individual companies will react to the company residence measure, it is unlikely to affect companies with substantive operations here and the broader Road Map will provide the foundations for Ireland to advance and prosper as a location for both indigenous and foreign corporate investment.</p></reply>

This report is published on the Department's website and can be viewed at the following link:</p><p>In attempting to assess the effective corporate tax rate that is applied to the total of company profits in Ireland, the Paper concludes that the approach based on national aggregate statistics is the most suitable.  Using that approach based on separate datasets from the Central Statistics Office and the Revenue Commissioners, the Report found that since 2003 the effective corporate tax rate has averaged 10.9% and 10.7% respectively with the two datasets.</p><p>It is not possible to accurately cost the proposal to increase the effective rate to 12.5%.  While the effective rate is lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of double taxation relief and a small number of corporate tax incentives such as the Research and Development Tax Credit and the Tax Relief for New Start-Up Companies for example. </p><p>On the issue generally, some countries have a high headline rate of corporation which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent: we have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base. </p><p>We therefore only have a small number of tax incentives in Ireland, and we make sure that those we do have are specifically targeted.  They are focussed:</p><p>- firstly on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current government policy; and</p><p>- secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.</p><p>We make sure that we review the few incentives that we have on a regular basis to ensure value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  An example of this is the review of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit which took place in 2013.  This review found that the tax credit meets these objectives, and is important for supporting jobs and innovation in Ireland.</p><p>In order to ensure the proper evaluation of such reliefs on an on-going basis, the Department of Finance developed and published new guidelines for the Evaluation of Tax Expenditures which can be viewed at the following link:</p></reply>

Indeed, I note that the ESRI in its Summer Quarterly Economic Commentary published yesterday confirms it too expects a 2015 headline deficit of 2.3 per cent, well inside the 3 per cent of GDP ceiling.</p><p>From 2016 onwards, the public finances in Ireland will therefore be subject to the requirements of the preventive arm of the SGP.  The European Commission assesses compliance with the requirements of the preventive arm on the basis of two complimentary pillars.  First is the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance and the second is compliance with the expenditure benchmark.  The minimum improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark are in theory designed to be complementary, although differences between the two metrics can emerge from time-to-time.</p><p>The IFAC noted that the fiscal projections contained in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) did not show Ireland complying with our requirements under the SGP; in other words, that the improvement in our structural balance is below the required 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2016.</p><p>However, SPU estimates show that for Ireland compliance with the expenditure benchmark pillar is consistent with delivering a lower suggested quantum of structural adjustment in 2016.  This somewhat counterintuitive outcome was explicitly addressed in the SPU, and emphasises the problems posed by some of the technical aspects of the rules.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that compliance with the requirements of the SGP is ultimately assessed on the basis of analysis undertaken by the European Commission.  In this context, the recent of the SPU published by the European Commission as part of the European Semester process finds that 'on the basis of information in the 2015 Stability Programme Update re-calculated according to the common methodology, progress towards the MTO is in line with the requirements of the preventive arm of the [Stability and Growth] Pact'.  The assessment by the Commission also finds that 'the rate of expenditure growth net of discretionary revenue measures, as planned in the SPU, is expected to be in line with the requirements of the expenditure benchmark pillar'.</p><p>In summary, therefore, the projections in the SPU are consistent with the requirements of the SGP.</p></reply>

The impact of this on outer years is broadly the same. It should be noted that this does not take estimates of second round economic effects into account.  All things being equal, the projected straight line improvement in the deficit of 0.6% of GDP would be reduced somewhat. </p>  <p>  The post-2016 forecasts in the SPU and SES reflect a no-policy change scenario other than an increase in expenditure of &euro;300m per annum for demographic pressures and indexation of the income tax system at an estimated cost of &euro;300m in a full year.  </p>  <p>  As outlined in the SES, initial estimates produced by my Department at that time suggest that there would be sufficient fiscal space to implement a budget along the lines planned for 2016 in each year from 2017 onwards, whilst complying with the rules and still achieve our MTO over the forecast horizon. </p>  <p>  However, while Government has stated elsewhere its intention to reduce the marginal rate of tax and new expenditure priorities, the production of fiscal forecasts reflecting policy beyond 2016 requires specific decisions on the allocation of fiscal space for each year.  Options include whether it should go wholly to expenditure (current/capital) or tax cuts or a combination of these and the iterative nature of forecasting over a four year period means that the range of potential fiscal projections is significant.</p>  <p>  When Government has fully considered the appropriate use of the available fiscal space, it will set out its proposals.</p></reply>

The fiscal projections contained in the SES and the Stability Programme Update (SPU) are based on a technical assumption of a budgetary package of &euro;1.2 billion in 2016, split evenly between expenditure increases and tax reductions. </p>  <p>  Post 2016, the fiscal forecasts included in the SES and the SPU, and all related general government expenditure ratios, reflect a no-policy-change scenario from an expenditure perspective, other than provision being made for a &euro;300 million increase in gross voted expenditure per annum to offset demographic pressures. </p>  <p>  This no-policy change scenario would result in the pace of structural adjustment in the period 2017 to 2020 significantly exceeding the minimum annual rate of greater than 0.5 per cent of GDP required under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).  However, it is the Government's firm intention - stated clearly in the SES - to make only the minimum adjustment required under the rules of the SGP in these years, which means that additional fiscal space will be available.  </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the application of this fiscal space will fall to be taken each year, as part of the Budget, taking account of the prevailing economic conditions and Government's commitments to investing in public infrastructure and services. As these resource allocation decisions are made by Government, the ratios in relation to general government expenditure will adjust accordingly.</p>  <p>  The Medium Term Expenditure Framework, with multiannual ceilings, was introduced in 2011 during a period of significant fiscal consolidation and has been very successful in assisting Government to meet its fiscal targets each year.  Working within this framework, the Government has been able to achieve its fiscal targets and also allocate additional resources to areas of priority as these became available. </p>  <p>  The Medium Term Expenditure Framework operates within the broader context of the SGP, in particular the Expenditure Benchmark.  The recent refinements in relation to the application of the Expenditure Benchmark now allow calculations of the reference rate for potential expenditure growth to be updated annually.  This ensures that the rules take account of the most up-to-date outturn and outlook for potential GDP growth.  This change has resulted in some 0.4 per cent of GDP in additional fiscal space in 2016.  With an annual update to the Expenditure Benchmark reference rate, it is reasonable that the expenditure ceilings should be revised to take account of the most up-to-date data.</p></reply>

The level of interest expressed in the new scheme has been remarkable.</p>  <p>  I should also say that the prioritisation of farms with clearly identified priority environmental assets is a key component of GLAS, and one which has been broadly welcomed by farmers, environmental NGOs and the European Commission.  The identification of priority farmland bird areas on the GLAS system, including Geese and Swans, was informed by the expertise of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, who provided the most up-to-date datasets available. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that GLAS is a completely voluntary scheme and the payment rate for this farmland bird action, at &euro;202 per hectare, is designed to take full account of the income foregone by the farmer in complying with the prescription outlined in the GLAS Specification. </p>  <p>  That said, an assessment of Tranche 1 of GLAS will be carried out before Tranche 2 is opened in the Autumn.  This assessment will look at uptake and issues arising, including the one you have raised.  Adjustments to the Scheme, if any, will be on environmental grounds and will be limited given that the overall structure of GLAS has already been approved by the Commission.</p></reply>

Much of the analysis therein reflects similar analysis done by the Department, Teagasc and others in this regard.  In relation to the CAP implementation issues which were raised in the Review:</p>  <p>  - The Single Payment Scheme was replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme and the Greening Payment in 2015. While all farmers in receipt of payment under the Basic Payment Scheme are eligible for the Greening Payment, the greening obligations apply mainly to arable farmers.  My Department worked very closely with the farming organisations, Teagasc, the ACA and individual farmers to introduce a system most appropriate to arable farming in Ireland.  An on-line application system was designed to assist arable farmers in ensuring that they were compliant with the greening obligations in their 2015 application.  The applications process has now closed and I am satisfied that every assistance was provided to individual farmers during the application period.  My Department has now commenced processing the applications with a view to making the Greening advance and balancing payments in October and December respectively.</p>  <p>  - The approval of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) was a key priority of mine and following my recent announcement of its approval by the Commission, I have commenced a number of key measures, which will underpin economic growth and development throughout rural Ireland in the years to come.</p></reply>

The funding will enable the expansion of the GYDP service by approximately 18% nationwide.  The locations for new projects and for the additional youth justice workers have been selected following a detailed examination by IYJS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of national youth crime and population statistics, including a detailed analysis of youth crime by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service.

The project will employ two youth justice workers to engage young people in the area who have come in to contact with the local Juvenile Liaison Officer because of their offending behaviour.  The project will operate in line with the existing "Operational Requirements" for GYDPs (available on the IYJS website).  The resource will also form part of the new Garda Youth Diversion delivery model currently being developed in Cork City Garda Division by local Garda management and the service provider in the area with support from the National Garda Youth Diversion Office and Community Programmes Unit, IYJS.</p></reply>

Among these measures are initiatives to improve the qualifications of, and provide training opportunities to, early years professionals.</p>  <p>  New qualification requirements for staff working directly with children in early years settings are planned.  All staff will be required to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent qualification. In addition, pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will be required to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent to qualify for ECCE.  To support staff to meet these new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund which allocated &euro;3 million to almost 3,000 staff for the purpose of up-skilling.  Further, my Department provides some &euro;16 million annually to City and County Childcare Committees, the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations and the Early Years Specialist Service towards the valuable work of these bodies who support early years' services and professionals around the country, through training, mentoring, continuing professional development programmes, networking and cluster-type support groups. </p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education will be considering further steps to be taken to support the professional development of the sector.  It will also consider options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision and support the sustainability of the early years sector.  It is likely that increased capitation rates will be considered in this context.  The Group is expected to submit a series of recommendations to Government in June 2015.</p></reply>

This Programme, which has an annual cost of &euro;170 million, benefits in the region of 67,000 children every year. </p>  <p>  To deliver the free pre-school year, a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating early years services.  A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week is paid per eligible child to services with more highly qualified staff.  These capitation payments are paid to services in advance of, and during, each school term. </p>  <p>  Despite the downturn and the difficult budgetary situation, and the need to reduce capitation payments in 2012, the Government did maintain the pre-school year on a universal and free basis and, importantly, the number of  early years services participating in the Programme, at approximately 4,200, remained consistent.  The funding provided under the  Early Childhood Care and Education Programme to these services was a guaranteed source of income at that time and ensured that early years services were able to continue to deliver services at a time when the demand for childcare had fallen considerably.  </p>  <p>  One of the issues to be considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education will be capitation rates and funding options overall for this area.  It will consider options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision and support the sustainability of the early years sector.

I can advise the Deputy that the Commission has begun this important work.  The Government Order and a number of related explanatory documents are available on my Department's website (www.dcya.gov.ie). </p>  <p>  The Government specifically provided for a confidential committee as a forum intended to facilitate any individual who wishes to describe their experiences of living or working in relevant homes to the Commission.  I know many former residents have welcomed this opportunity.  This module, which is scheduled to be completed by August 2016, will allow the Commission to ground its work in the reality of the experience of mothers and children in these institutions.  It is essential to reiterate that the Commission is completely independent in the conduct of its investigations.  Therefore the precise timing and approach to the Confidential Committee module is a matter for the Commission to decide and progress.  I have no role in these decisions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Commission recently launched its own website www.mbhcoi.ie.  As indicated on the website, the Commission would like to hear directly from persons with information about matters within its terms of reference.  I am also aware that the Commission intends to conduct a national advertising campaign to notify members of the public who may wish to engage with its investigations.  </p>  <p>  Persons wishing to contact the Commission may do so by writing directly to: Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, 73 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2, email info@mbhcoi.ie or by using the confidential freephone number 1800 806688.</p></reply>

In this context, I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children's educational and developmental outcomes.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of a second pre-school year however, would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not presently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating. </p>  <p>  It is likely that  the introduction of a second pre-school year will be one of a number of options that will be considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established in February this year.  This Inter-Departmental Group, which includes representation from right across Government, including the Department of Education and Skills, is tasked with setting out a range of options for current and future investment, will consider options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision and support the sustainability of the early years sector.  The Group is expected to submit a series of recommendations to Government in June 2015.</p></reply>

Improvements were needed in the refinement and consistent application of some processes and definitions, particularly with respect to the appropriate diversion of cases to a local area pathway or for a case to be formally closed.  Local area pathways involve working with parents to provide support focussed on protective factors for children, and family support to avail of universal services.  I understand that the findings from the ongoing quality assurance work will be used to inform future business planning with my Department.  In the Louth/Meath administrative area, Tusla has indicated that key aspects of the service were not at an acceptable standard.  Currently, measures, led by the Chief Operations Officer, are being taken to address this.

This figure, which includes the additional funding of &euro;35 million held by the Department of Health the details of which were finalised recently, represents 6.5% of the total health budget.  In relation to the 2006 percentage figure it is difficult to carry out a precise comparison, as performance and financial reporting prior to 2014 was done on a geographic basis as opposed to the current Directorate model.  However, it is estimated that it would have been approximately 7%.</p><p>A total of &euro;125m additional ring-fenced funding has been provided by the Government for mental health since coming into office.  This funding has been provided to recruit approximately 1,150 new staff for the ongoing re-configuration of community mental health teams, in particular, and to underpin the development of a recovery-focussed and community-centred service.  Bearing in mind the many competing demands on both the wider Health budget and Exchequer funding generally, this represents a substantial ongoing commitment to our mental health services.</p><p>Historically, funding for the mental health services constituted a high proportion of overall health spend in Ireland.  In part, this reflected the traditional emphasis on an institutional model of service delivery with a clinical care focus. While funding may have been a higher than current percentage of 6.5%, much of this funding would have been spent on what was considered a staff-intensive and relatively expensive model of service.  In addition, historically other areas of the overall health budget in Ireland may not have received an adequate level of funding appropriate to a modern community-focussed health service.  This has been improved in recent times with, for example, greater investment in primary and community care areas, which also benefits people with mental health issues. </p><p>In line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>, the HSE mental health service is now moving towards a more person-centred recovery model of care, with an increasing focus on community delivery.  This model of service is widely agreed to be more focussed on the needs of the service user in the first instance.  It is also considered to be more cost effective and aims for a planned greater integration of services across the primary and community care sectors over time.  Therefore, while every effort will be made to maximise resources for mental health, the promotion and resourcing of positive mental health extends to a much broader range of HSE service areas.</p></reply>

All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.</p>  <p>  I convened the ED Taskforce in December 2014 to provide focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding.  Reflecting the wide range of experience and perspectives represented on the Taskforce, the resulting action plan presented a range of time defined actions to (i) optimise existing hospital and community capacity; (ii) develop internal capability and process improvement and (iii) improve leadership, governance, planning and oversight.  </p>  <p>  The most immediate actions listed have already commenced, supported by an initial &euro;25 million in 2014 to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressure on, acute hospitals.  Additional funds of &euro;74 million have been provided in 2015 to increase the number of long term nursing home care places and reduce the waiting time for the funding of such places, as well as providing additional transitional care beds and home care packages to provide viable supports for those no longer needing acute hospital care.   </p>  <p>  All of these actions are intended to enable the HSE to deliver my stated objective of reducing the number of patients with Delayed Discharges by one-third to less than 500, and the number of patients on trolleys in EDs waiting for admission for over nine hours to fewer than 70.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

It reported that none of the Public Access Defibrillation programmes evaluated would be considered cost-effective using conventional willingness to pay thresholds. </p>  <p>  One of the means to help improve health outcomes in this area is through the expansion of the National First Response Network. Community first responder groups comprise this national network.  These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.</p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched earlier this year, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups.  CFR Ireland is supported by the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  Each group is linked to the National Ambulance Service control and despatch system.  If there is a cardiac 999 call in an area, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the site and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service and Rapid Response vehicles arrives.</p>  <p>  This national initiative provides an opportunity to extend care for cardiac events.  The prospect for a pilot programme on defibrillator availability in a local area will also be explored and will address the practical issues relating to the use of AEDs in the community.  In addition, the development of a national AED register is under consideration.</p></reply>

This is a fantastic achievement.  One third of these missions have involved very serious and time-critical STEMI heart attacks.  These patients need to be brought to a specialist cardiac catheter unit within 90 minutes of diagnosis by an ambulance crew.  In particular, the EAS allows this to be done for patients in remoter parts of the west.</p>  <p>  The EAS pilot established a clear need for an aeromedical emergency service targeted at the most seriously ill patients who are at a distance from major acute hospitals.  The EAS Establishment Group examined a number of options for putting the EAS on a permanent and sustainable footing.  I am, along with my colleague the Minister for Defence, considering the Group's recommendations for sustainable support to the service.

If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question concerning the calculation of running costs of public and private nursing homes and the extent to which high dependency patients are referred to both the public and private sector I can advise that when the stage is reached where an older person can no longer remain at home, the State provides financial support through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) for those who need long-term residential care.  Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme, a key component of our health service involves very significant financial commitment on the part of the State.  </p>  <p>  Once a person's application to the NHSS is approved they can choose to enter any approved nursing home that has an available bed and can cater for their care needs.  The applicant can choose a public, private or voluntary nursing home, and their level of contribution is unaffected by their choice of nursing home, regardless of the type of nursing home chosen or the cost of care. </p>  <p>  The price to be paid for the provision of care in both private nursing homes and section 39 voluntary nursing homes is negotiated facility by facility by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), and these agreed prices are the basis for the financial support payable by the HSE under the NHSS. The NTPF is independent in the performance of its function. </p>  <p>  The NTPF has no role in setting or negotiating prices for public facilities.  The maximum prices to be paid in public facilities, and referred to as the cost of care, are set by the HSE and are published on the HSE website.  The cost for each public nursing home is determined using the definition of long-term residential care services underpinned by an agreed set of cost components which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

My Department meets with the Forum representatives on a quarterly basis. </p>  <p>  Hospital Groups provide a real opportunity for statutory and voluntary providers to work together and build on the strengths of both sectors.  The future of all hospitals is as a constituent hospital within their Group, with the expectation that every hospital in the Group, large and small, statutory and voluntary, will play a vital role within the Group.   </p>  <p>  Any programme of change on the scale of the establishment of Hospital Groups throws up issues to be addressed as new models are refined and new relationships developed.  However,the health policy environment within which voluntary hospitals operate is supportive of the valuable role played by these hospitals over many decades.  The future of these hospitals is very positive and this includes their new role in  contributing to the success of Hospital Groups in serving population health needs.</p></reply>

Ministers agreed to continue to examine opportunities and progress in drawing down EU funding and that a further update on EU Funding Opportunities will be brought to the next Plenary meeting. </p>  <p>  The NSMC welcomed the approval of the INTERREG V programme by the European Commission and looked forward to the early finalisation of the PEACE IV programme.  Ministers welcomed the indications that good progress is being made towards reaching the joint target of &euro;175 million in terms of cross-border projects under the Horizon 2020 Programme, and noted the work of InterTradeIreland and the All-Island Steering Group in raising awareness of this &euro;80bn EU programme. </p>  <p>  Ministers discussed the Progress Report prepared by the NSMC Joint Secretaries on the work of the North South Bodies and in the other NSMC areas for co-operation since the last Plenary meeting on 5 December 2014 in Armagh. </p>  <p>  The Council noted that the development of new priorities for North/South cooperation was discussed at the NSMC Institutional meeting on 25 February 2015 and that 'new Sectoral Priorities' will be an agenda item at future Institutional meetings.  The Council noted the decision that was agreed at the NSMC Institutional meeting whereby Ministers would review their current Work Programmes and that endorsement of any changes will be sought at a future NSMC Plenary meeting. </p>  <p>  There was an extensive discussion on cross-border smuggling and fuel laundering.  Ministers noted the on-going efforts by the relevant authorities in both jurisdictions to tackle this criminal activity which affects the lives and well-being of people on both sides of the border.  The very detrimental environmental and health effects of fuel laundering were discussed and Ministers noted the introduction of the new fuel marker in both jurisdictions.  The Council recognised the importance of closer co-operation between agencies in tackling and combating cross-border smuggling and fuel laundering and agreed that the topic be revisited at a future meeting.</p>  <p>  The Council noted the continued engagement between officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister with stakeholders concerning the future development of the North West Gateway Initiative and the ongoing discussions on arrangements to hold a meeting of relevant Ministers on this in the North West.  The Council further noted the current work by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council to develop new and collaborative cross-border arrangements at local government level to promote the development of the North West region, in cooperation with regional stakeholders and central governments. </p>  <p>  The Council noted that, in line with the decision taken at the NSMC Institutional Meeting on 25 February 2015, the NSMC Joint Secretariat has consulted with Sponsor Departments and with Board members of the North South Implementation Bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited regarding the proposal to extend the existing terms of appointment of Board Members for 12 months.  This consultation is currently ongoing.  The Council agreed that decisions on Board appointments will be made before the expiry of the current Board members' terms of office in December 2015. </p>  <p>  Ministers also noted the current position on setting up a North South Consultative Forum as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  The Council approved a schedule of NSMC meetings proposed by the Joint Secretariat, including the next NSMC Plenary meeting in November 2015.   </p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing, with my colleagues in Government, to pursue opportunities for further North/South co-operation with the Northern Ireland Executive, particularly through the structures of the North South Ministerial Council.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  The Circular explains that transition to Post Primary school should be recognised as a critical time for a student with special educational needs.  The Circular sets out that a key goal of SNA support is to help children to develop their independent living skills, and that continued and ongoing access to SNA support is generally not desirable for post-primary students, unless essential, as it can impede their independence and socialisation needs at an important developmental stage of their life.</p><p>  Accordingly, whereas SNA support will be provided to post primary schools when required, only pupils with chronic and serious care needs will normally be allocated SNA support in post primary schools.  In considering applications for SNA support from post primary schools the NCSE will take into account the importance of the requirement to allocate necessary care supports with the right of a child to acquire personal independence skills.</p><p>  All schools have been asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March, 2015. </p><p>  The NCSE will consider all applications for SNA support which have been made by schools and all schools will be advised of their revised SNA allocations for the 2015/16 school year, prior to the end of the current school year.</p><p>  Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The conclusion of Stage 2(b) will also include the completion of tender documents.</p><p>  Due to competing demands on my Department's capital budget, imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements, it was not possible to include this project in the 5 year construction programme announced in March 2012.</p><p>  School building projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy, which have been initiated but not included in the current five year construction programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to my Department in the future.</p></reply>
