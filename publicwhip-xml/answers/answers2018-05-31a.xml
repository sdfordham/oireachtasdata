In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .  This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. The Map is colour coded and is searchable by address or eircode.  I also signed a  Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  As of end March this year eir has passed 145,00 premises and has committed to completing this rollout.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at the website.</p><p>The procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State led intervention area is now in its final stages. My Department will engage with the successful company on the most efficient rollout of the network.</p><p>In the interim, high speed broadband services continues to be rolled out through significant commercial investment by commercial operators to a value of &euro;2.75 billion in the last 5 years.  By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises the length and breadth of Ireland will have access to high speed broadband.  </p><p>For those premises awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p></reply>

Given the significant level of interest in developing solar energy projects in Ireland, I wrote to my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government last year, and we agreed that both Departments would engage at senior level to explore the potential for enhancing national planning level guidance on solar energy.</p>  <p>  My officials are engaging with their counterparts in the  Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on this matter taking account of solar energy projects being assessed by planning authorities and the scope for future development of the sector in the context of emerging and future policy direction in the area of renewable energy generally. </p>  <p>  My Department's engagement with  Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government officials will also examine if scope exists to streamline wider regulatory measures in a manner sufficient to enhance the development of solar energy, such as enhancing current exemptions from planning permissions in relation to rooftop solar installations. </p>  <p>  Given the interrelationships between the development of our renewable energy potential and strategic planning objectives as laid out in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework, both Departments will work to progress these matters in the coming months. </p></reply>

The most recent analysis from April was published on 25 May 2018 and is available on my Department's website.  Last summer, I established the Price Monitoring Group to monitor pricing developments for residential household waste collection services during the phasing out of flat rate fees.  The Group is chaired by Mr Frank Conway, an independent financial expert.  The membership of the Group also includes a statistician from the Central Statistics Office and Shelfwatch, an independent price monitoring group.  The Group monitors 26 service providers; this comprises 19 individual companies with several of those being monitored in more than one area. I have recently decided to extend the operation of the Price Monitoring Group to the end of the year to continue it monitoring of pricing developments. </p>  <p>  The Price Monitoring Group was not established to provide a price comparison service. This would require whole-of-market monitoring of the sixty plus household waste collectors in the country across the different areas they provide a service. Accordingly, while the company names are not currently being published, the prices quoted by the companies being tracked are made available by the Group for all to see.</p>  <p>  The Chair of the Price Monitoring Group, Mr Conway, has recently reported to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that while fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability for householders.  The Price Monitoring Group has reported that there are currently 9 different types of price models on the market. The main price examples include a service charge plus charge per bin lift, with an excess per kg charge, and a service charge plus per kg weight charge. The most popular service offering now is the &lsquo;service charge including weight allowance, plus per kg charge for excess above allowance&rsquo;. </p>  <p>    </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-31a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018053100067#WRA02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 34, 37, 40 and 43 together.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I am responsible for the postal sector including the governance of An Post.  I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and am concerned to ensure the needs of those communities continue to be met.</p>  <p>  As part of its strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail.  An Post's recently announced vision for the post office network centres around the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network. Such services will include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. The announcement by An Post is supported by an agreement reached with the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following three months of intensive negotiations, which has subsequently been endorsed by 80% of IPU members. </p>  <p>  The agreement represents a positive first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  We are already seeing a number of important new business initiatives being progressed. </p>  <p>  A pilot e-Local service was launched by An Post last year in three districts- Bantry, Mullingar and Ennis. This service combines the strengths of online commerce with that of An Post mails network for the benefit of local business. It gives local business an edge over national and international online operators by connecting retailers with their customers both online and in person. A key feature of the eLocal.ie service is that An Post will give each retailer an online presence, displaying their goods and services, and enabling online orders.</p>  <p>  As part of its consideration of the financial position of An Post, Government agreed that further opportunities for Government business through the Post Office Network, particularly the payment of motor tax, should be explored.  While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there is always likely to be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services. The post office network is the obvious choice as the &ldquo;offline gateway&rdquo; for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens. My Department has engaged with An Post and other relevant stakeholders such as the Office of Government Procurement, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and other Government Departments to assess how additional Government business might be channelled through the post office network. Discussions have been positive in this regard.</p>  <p>  The first practical step that the Government is taking in this area is to rollout the digital assist pilot programme. Under that programme, post offices will provide access to a wide range of Government services. Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been secured, by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, for the roll-out of the pilot scheme. Ten post offices will be equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions. The ten pilot schemes will be located in rural post offices and will be in place later this year.</p>  <p>  In April 2018 the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, Child Benefit and other social welfare payments in cash at Post Offices. Last year&rsquo;s contract amounted to &euro;51 million for 33.6 million payments, and the value of the 2018 contract is expected to match that.  This re-affirms Government policy which sees the post office network as a key piece of the country&rsquo;s financial and social infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.   Accordingly, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to actively encourage payment at post offices.</p>  <p>  In addition to this the National Treasury Management Agency also provides significant business to An Post.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that there is concern regarding the potential closure of post offices.  An Post have advised that under the terms of the new agreement between An Post and the IPU some postmasters who wish to retire will be offered a voluntary severance package. There will be no compulsory closures of Post Offices as a consequence of this new deal. Postmasters have until July 31st next to signal their intentions in this matter.  It is important to note that a new protocol has been established which sets out how An Post will facilitate the continued provision of Post Office services in areas where an existing postmasters retires or ceases operating an existing Post Office. In such cases An Post will make an assessment on the future provision of post office services within the locality by reference to specific agreed criteria.</p>  <p>  Any individuals, groups or representatives concerned with the decision can apply to have An Post&rsquo;s decision reviewed through a new independent review process which will determine if An Post has correctly applied the criteria outlined in the protocol. Details of the independent review process will be specified in the notice detailing the decision of the future post office services within the relevant post office and will also be detailed on the An Post website.</p>  <p>  All avenues are being explored to ensure services available through the post office network are enhanced in order that we have a strong, sustainable, customer focussed network</p></reply>

On 21 December 2016 An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the North-South Interconnector in Ireland. The decision concluded a lengthy planning process which included an Oral Hearing completed over eleven weeks from March to May of 2016. On 23 January 2018, full planning permission was also granted for the section of the line that lies in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The approval process for that part of the North South Interconnector in Northern Ireland is a matter for the authorities there.  The Judgement referred to in the question relates to a different project although it has been acknowledged  that  it could have wider implications for decision making  in Northern Ireland. I understand that the decision is being appealed by the Department for Infrastructure in Belfast. </p>  <p>  Following the planning consents, and the conclusion of a number of judicial review proceedings relating to the planning decision in Ireland, the construction of the project and any procurement processes that arise from that construction are operational matters for EirGrid and ESB Networks, and one in which I have no function. </p></reply>

The White Paper identifies the importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050 but also recognises that some fossil fuels will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.  </p><p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. </p><p>Overall, provisional SEAI analysis shows that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources, with an expectation that Ireland will achieve at least 80% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020. The SEAI has also estimated that the contribution of renewables avoided  &euro;276 million of fossil fuel imports in 2017.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to supporting the transition of peat power plants to greater amounts of biomass whilst mindful of the need to develop a sustainable indigenous supply chain and support employment in the regions. Furthermore, the National Mitigation Plan 2017 restates the Government's commitment to move from a fossil fuel based electricity system to a low carbon power system. </p><p>The Government has also adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy including the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  In addition, my Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.</p><p>Ireland aims to increase renewable energy in transport by increasing the use of sustainable biofuels and by the increased deployment of Electric Vehicles. An Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme is in place to provide grant aid of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new full battery EV (EV) or Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).  These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000.  Budget 2018 extended VRT reliefs on PHEVs to end 2018 and on EVs to end 2021. A new grant to support the installation of home charger points for buyers of new and second-hand EVs is in place since January 2018. </p><p>An electric vehicle public awareness campaign was developed by SEAI and launched on the opening day of the SEAI Energy Show last month. The first phase of the campaign includes a new website () which provides information on the benefits of buying and driving an EV, the EV models available and where to arrange a test drive. The accompanying advertising campaign will be followed by a series of national, regional and local roadshows providing the public the opportunity to test drive electric vehicles. </p><p>The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering the measures and options available to Government to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles. This has led to an expanded range of supports for electric vehicles (EVs). </p><p>The focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 renewable target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, including the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.</p></reply>

The EPA Progress Report Towards EU Targets 2017<b></b>showed that Ireland recycled  34% by weight of plastics in 2015, counting exclusively material that is recycled back into plastics. The EU target is 22.5% and Ireland is clearly well ahead of this target.  </p><p>A private member&rsquo;s Waste Reduction Bill was introduced to the House last year.  On its introduction, I fully supported the intention of the Bill to reduce plastic waste, but I expressed reservations in relation to certain aspects of it, including the introduction of a Deposit and Return scheme for sealed containers in which beverages are sold.  </p><p>My main concern in this regard was in relation to the potential costs versus the benefits of the introduction of such a scheme.  I am of the belief that the operational and economic impacts of a Deposit and Return Scheme on an existing successful producer responsibility scheme need to be assessed thoroughly.</p><p>In addition, the effect of the introduction of such a scheme on domestic collections needs to be evaluated.  If we take the more valuable material out of the domestic recycling bin, waste costs for households will rise.  </p><p>In light of this, I asked the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to look at the merits of a deposit and refund scheme at a national level.  The Committee&rsquo;s report, which was published this week, recommends that the Bill proceed to Committee Stage.  However, it also suggests that the following may merit consideration: </p><p>- firstly, whether adequate up-to-date analysis has been completed to support a Deposit and Return Scheme; and </p><p>- secondly, whether alternatives to the proposal have been adequately addressed to ascertain whether the proposal reflects the most feasible, efficient and sustainable option which will most likely achieve the best environmental benefits while minimising financial/economic risks, Exchequer outlay, both set-up and annual costs, and the compliance burden.</p><p>In the absence of an examination and a clear understanding of the costs and impacts, I will not be in position to support the introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme in the manner proposed by the Waste Reduction Bill. </p></reply>

Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group which I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.    Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, which will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The fifth meeting of the Taskforce Implementation Group was held on 25 April 2018, and the Quarter 1 2018 Progress Report has since been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This report offers progress updates on all Q1 actions.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:</p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p>  <p>  - Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing, and has been included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this. </p>  <p>  - Under Action 40 of the 2016 Report, a review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots. This work is continuing in 2018 under a focus group to inform future policy development and initiatives. The focus group will provide guidance with respect to categories of locations where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority. </p>  <p>  - ComReg is also delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

Furthermore, micro generation will be required given the scale of our climate and energy ambition as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The proposed pilot scheme for micro generation which I announced earlier this year will target solar PV and self-consumption amongst domestic customers.  It is important that before a scheme like this is introduced, the likely demand for the scheme is understood and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are currently undertaking a study which will inform the final design of this pilot.  It is equally important that safety, technical and training requirements are established in advance of this pilot scheme being rolled out.</p>  <p>  The data gathered during the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro generation in Ireland that may be appropriate, as we align with the ambition of the recast Renewable Energy Directive which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers. This pilot scheme will deliver on ambitions and commitments made in the Energy White Paper and the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Last year, my Department assessed micro generation, across a number of renewable electricity generating technologies, as part of the economic analysis to underpin the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The assessment identified technical and financial challenges which may need to be addressed before a broader support scheme for micro generation can be introduced.  This is in line with international experience, including across the EU, where many member states who have introduced supports for micro generation have had to reform them or cancel them altogether. </p>  <p>  The reality is that bringing microgen onto a system designed for large generators is complicated. It impacts how we pay for the network, how we manage regulation and how we technically manage the system.  My Department is continuing to work closely with the micro generation sector and the SEAI to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner.   </p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017. </p><p>There are over 101,000 premises in Donegal. Nearly 34,000 (34%) fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention. More than 59,000 (58%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are, or will be, served by commercial providers, while approximately 8,000 (8%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment.</p><p>Information on the categories of specific premises can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website by entering the relevant eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>One bidder, eir, publicly withdrew from the procurement process on 30 January 2018. While this was regrettable, it was a commercial decision for eir to make.  The specialist NBP procurement team continues to engage intensively with all relevant stakeholders, including the sse/enet consortium, to ensure the earliest possible achievement of the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing reliable high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland. </p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at .  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website .</p><p>Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. Data for Q1 2018 recently submitted by eir to my Department indicates that the company has passed some 145,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. 17,772 of these are in Donegal. A further 8,302 Donegal premises are in the LIGHT BLUE area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map and remain to be passed as part of eir&rsquo;s rollout. </p><p>Eir has signalled that there would likely be knock-on effects to their 2018 milestone targets due to the severe weather impacts of both storms Ophelia and Emma and my Department continues to engage with the company in this regard. I have met with the senior management in eir and expressed to them the importance of implementing measures to catch up with milestone targets as a priority.  </p><p>A county by county breakdown of eir&rsquo;s data for Q1 2018 is now available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

This represented a 12.9% increase on Ireland's reference starting point of 3.1% in 2005, and is the third highest increase assigned to any of the 28 Member States of the European Union. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding.</p>  <p>  Provisional data from the SEAI indicates that 30.1% of electricity, 6.9% of heat and 7.1% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2017. Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources, with an expectation that Ireland will achieve at least 80% of its 16% renewable energy target by 2020.</p>  <p>  The Renewable Energy Directive provides a comprehensive framework for Member States to work towards achieving individual and EU renewable energy targets, including mechanisms for countries to work together such as statistical transfers, which allow Member States to meet their targets by purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets.</p>  <p>  In the absence of an established market mechanism, estimates of the cost of using instruments such as statistical transfers are necessarily tentative. Work undertaken by the SEAI in 2016 indicated that the cost to Ireland of not meeting our overall renewable energy targets may be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.  Costs per percentage point for statistical transfers could be below the lower end of the range suggested by SEAI but this will depend on market conditions when and if purchases are made.  Present indications &ndash; based on trades agreed by Luxembourg late last year - are that the costs per percentage point for statistical transfers could be below the lower end of the range suggested by SEAI.</p>  <p>  While the focus of my Department remains firmly on meeting our 2020 target and on implementation of renewable energy measures, including a new  Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a new Support Scheme for Renewal Heat (SSRH), contingency planning has commenced to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and cost of addressing our target within the framework of the Directive.</p>  <p>  Any requirement for statistical transfers to meet compliance would be undertaken against a background of discussions by the Irish authorities with the EU Commission and relevant Member States. As any purchases arising would be made over a number of years, the costs to the Exchequer of acquiring statistical transfers to meet any potential shortfall would be spread over a period of time and in any event the cumulative costs would not be known until 2021, the deadline for completion of all purchases. </p></reply>

Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised. Natural gas will continue to play a key role as a transition fuel.  </p><p>The National Development Plan 2018-2027 sets out clear measures towards decarbonisation, including the upgrading of 45,000 homes every year from 2021 to make them energy efficient, up to 4,500MW of renewable electricity generation, roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat, and commitments on electric vehicles and low-emission public transport. However, in the transition, the lowest CO2 emitting fossil fuel is still required to ensure a safe, secure and competitive path towards sustainability. In addition to this the planned closure of Moneypoint by 2025 and the ending of peat for electricity generation in advance of 2030 will have a positive impact.</p><p>In regard to future electricity demand, EirGrid have modelled a number of scenarios in their 2017 publication &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Energy Scenarios&quot;. Each scenario predicts a different possible future for the generation and consumption of electricity out to 2040. A link to the document is available at  </p><p><b><i>.</i></b></p><p>At the December 2017 Energy Council, the General Agreement reached by the Member States on the Clean Energy Package set out an EU level 2030 target of 27% for Renewable Energy and 30% for Energy Efficiency.  There were also a number of flexibilities agreed by the Council across a number of the proposals. Trilogues with the EU Parliament are ongoing with the Parliament seeking a 35% renewable energy target, a  35% energy efficiency target and also seeking to limit the flexibilities in the proposals.  </p><p>The level of Ireland's renewable energy ambition post-2020 will have regard to our obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive and the Governance Regulation as may be agreed under  the Clean Energy Package. It is important that our contribution to the overall goals can be met in a cost efficient way, that is fair and technically achievable, and takes account of our specific economic circumstances and geographical position on the periphery of Europe.  </p></reply>

Energy efficiency will also realise benefits for air quality, health, social inclusion, business competitiveness and better public services, all of which will make a real and positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  Exchequer investment of &euro;4 billion, along with taxation and regulatory measures, are provided for under the NDP. This will be necessary to drive the step change in energy performance in the residential sector. The ambition is to increase grant supported energy efficient renovations from 30,000 homes per annum to circa 45,000 from 2021, while driving the demand for a higher energy performance standard.Ireland&rsquo;s White Paper on Energy Policy, <i>Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030,</i>National Mitigation Plan (NMP) and Long Term Renovation Strategy (LTRS) all recognise the fact that extensive renovation of our building stock will need to take place in order to meet both national and international targets for energy savings and emissions reduction by 2050.  A number of actions which are outlined in the NMP and LTRS are already underway to achieve these levels of retrofit and promote deep retrofit of buildings across all building types and tenure.  Those actions which relate specifically to homes are outlined below.</p><p>- The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme is investigating how to create a scalable offering for the deep retrofit of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER), while building consumer demand and contractor capacity for deep retrofit. Under the scheme Government is funding up to 50% of the total capital and project management costs for homes that achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating post retrofit.  This will inform a model that can make deep retrofit available to individual homeowners on a larger scale post 2020, and critically will help Ireland move away from fossil fuels to clean renewable heating systems, such as solar and heat pumps.</p><p>- The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grant aid to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home. Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures such as insulation, heating controls and solar thermal technology. I recently expanded this scheme to support the transition away from fossil fuels, and achieve greater energy savings and emissions reductions, by providing a grant for heat pumps and increasing the funding for external insulation. </p><p>- The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. I recently announced the expansion of the scheme to include internal and external wall insulation in order to increase the number of people that can receive upgrades and increase the energy savings and emissions reductions the scheme can achieve by enabling fuel switching. </p><p>- The Better Energy Communities scheme allows groups of buildings to apply for funding to improve their energy efficiency. This scheme has resulted in innovative approaches to renovation being developed, while also contributing to the overall reduction of energy usage and emissions from our building stock.</p><p>- The Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme, funded by my Department, is a joint policy initiative with the Department of Health, and is operated by SEAI and the HSE. It will measure the health and wellbeing impacts associated with improved energy efficiency. Increasing awareness of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency is critical to encourage people to invest in and make their contribution to action on climate change.</p></reply>

The Committee published their report at the end of November 2017. The findings of the report were debated in the D&aacute;il on 29 March, 2018. Both Public Service Broadcasters spend millions of euro each year on independently produced programming. This is vital in supporting a vibrant independent sector, including in the regions. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Section 116 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that RT&Eacute; make specific amounts available each year for the commissioning of television and radio programmes from the independent production sector. In 2017, RTE  spent &euro;39.7m on independent productions. A total of 726 hours (251 radio, 475 television) were commissioned across a range of programme categories.</p><p>  In addition, TG4 commissions the majority of its Irish language programmes from independent production companies throughout Ireland.

One of its statutory functions is to carry out market monitoring to ensure that competition continues to develop and that customers benefit from competition. Two reports published by the regulator last year concluded that Irish energy markets are competitive, with the most recently available EU comparable electricity and gas supplier switching data also pointing towards a competitive Irish market.  The CRU is an independent statutory body, and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. The regulation of retail market prices for electricity in Ireland ended in 2011 and for gas prices in 2014.  The Government has no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of electricity prices, with the main thrust of Government policy on energy costs focused on the competitive market and supports for energy efficiency. Government policy has supported competition to drive down prices, and data from approved price comparison sites (<i>www.bonkers.ie</i>and <i>www.switcher.ie</i>) shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers. </p><p>Consistent with European energy policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive.  The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Competition exerts downward pressure on suppliers&rsquo; prices.</p><p>Section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, sets out the procedure under which the Minister may give &ldquo;general policy directions&rdquo;.  The legislation sets out details on the tasks and inter-alia timelines, consultation requirements with the independent regulator and Oireachtas, and identifies restrictions on the areas where such directions may not be given. </p><p>Energy markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime in which member states must guarantee the independence of National Regulatory Authorities, which are expressively forbidden from taking direct instructions from government, or any public body, when carrying out their regulatory tasks.  The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the EU Third Energy Package, specifically in Directive 2009/72/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity.A policy direction in this matter is therefore not being considered. </p></reply>

It identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050.  It does not set out targets for specific renewable technologies; rather it provides a framework to guide policy between now and 2030.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.  The design of the new scheme included an extensive independent economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.  The analysis indicates that a number of renewable technologies have converging and in some cases overlapping cost ranges, and I note with interest the continued falling costs of renewable technologies over the past year, such as offshore wind and solar PV.  I expect to bring the final design proposals on the new RESS to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy for the sustainable development of our abundant offshore renewable energy resources.  The Strategic Environmental Assessment that underpinned the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters in the period to 2030.  An interim review of the OREDP was recently published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The Offshore Renewable Energy Steering Group, which oversees the implementation of the OREDP will now consider the recommendations of the review and continue the work of implementing the actions and enablers set out in the Plan.</p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that Solar PV has a role to play in Ireland's renewable electricity generation portfolio over the coming decade.  Solar PV emerges as a significant renewable electricity generating technology in all of EirGrid's 'Tomorrow Energy Scenarios' and, as well as providing opportunities for Solar PV under RESS, my Department supports the deployment of Solar PV through the SEAI led Better Energy Communities and pilot Deep Retrofit schemes.  Solar PV will also be supported under a pilot scheme to promote micro generation, due to be launched this summer.</p></reply>

Local authorities have specific powers under sections 55 and 56 of the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</p><p>Penalties for serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are substantial.  Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15M on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, my Department encourages a multi-faceted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education.  As such, I introduced an Anti-Dumping Initiative in 2017 to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.  Such was the response from across the country that I doubled the initial financial allocation with &euro;1.3M overall being provided to support 200 anti-dumping projects throughout Ireland.</p><p>Building on from the success of last year, I confirmed increased funding of &euro;2M for the 2018 Anti-Dumping Initiative and in April, I announced the projects nationwide that have been approved for funding with the full list available on my Department's website: <i><font color="#2F2F2F"></font></i><i><font color="#2F2F2F">. </font></i></p><p>The scope of the projects include: </p><p>- clean-up operations - removing illegal waste from across the country; </p><p>- household bulky waste initiatives &ndash; mattress/couch amnesties; </p><p>- awareness campaigns &ndash; social media campaigns and radio; </p><p>- preventative measures &ndash; installation of signage and fencing; </p><p>- surveillance operations &ndash; CCTV, drone and trail surveillance; </p><p>- SMART enforcement equipment and resources for waste enforcement officers.</p><p>In addition to the 200 plus projects that will receive funding from my Department, this year's Anti-Dumping Initiative includes a national pilot project undertaken by Sligo County Council aimed at tackling and addressing the source of illegal dumping through an Eircodes investigation while funding is also being made available to support the Connaught/Ulster Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authority in undertaking research on crime in the waste sector including an overview of the scale, cost and impact of waste crime in Ireland, and an assessment of illegal dumping identifying the socioeconomic and other factors leading to such activities. </p></reply>

The State is required to identify key critical infrastructure operators in a range of sectors, including energy, transport, health, drinking water supply and distribution and digital infrastructure.  These operators will be required to meet a set of binding obligations in respect of security measures and incident reporting.  The Directive also requires the State to apply a new regulatory regime on Digital Service Providers (DSPs) in the areas of cloud computing, online search engines and online market places.   The Directive also places other obligations on the State in terms of ensuring that States can cooperate and share information in the event of a large scale incident affecting several countries and to ensure that every State has significant capacity of its own.  These requirements include the designation of a National Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) with responsibility for risk and incident handling and the designation of a National Competent Authority (NCA) and a Single Point of Contact (SPoC). </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in my Department, which will be the National Competent Authority, has been working on transposition of the Directive for some time and this has included extensive engagement with industry.  The NCSC has provisionally identified a set of critical infrastructure operators and has published a set of draft security measures which will apply to these operators.  Regulations to transpose the Directive itself are at a very advanced stage.  The NCSC has also been developing its own capacity internally, particularly with regard to the CSIRT which received international accreditation last year. </p></reply>

It will be the 60th anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s first participation in a UN peacekeeping mission and it is the 40th anniversary of the first deployment of Defence Force personnel to Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL mission.</p>  <p>  Ireland has made a huge commitment to supporting peace and security in the Middle East region and has participated in the UNIFIL mission since its establishment in 1978.  There are currently some 370 personnel deployed to the mission.</p>  <p>  My recent visit to Lebanon in March, coincided with the official UN commemorations in Naqoura to mark the 40th anniversary of the UNIFIL mission's establishment.  It was an occasion to pay tribute to the tens of thousands of UN peacekeepers who have served together with local communities for peace in South Lebanon.  It was a great honour to  be present while a veteran Irish Peacekeeper delivered a poignant and emotional tribute  to fallen peacekeepers at the ceremony.  The respect and high regard that is held internationally for the professionalism displayed by our Irish Peacekeepers was clearly evident.</p>  <p>  Ireland's long service with the UNIFIL mission over the last 40 years means that the names of towns and villages in Southern Lebanon are  familiar to the Irish people.  The forty thousand Irish soldiers who have served with UNIFIL since 1978 have brought back stories and great memories of the UNIFIL mission. Sadly, Irish soldiers have also died and are remembered monthly in a ceremony in Tibnin, Lebanon.  I revisited the monument in the course of my recent visit and it was an opportunity to remember and honour the sacrifice made by Irish soldiers.</p>  <p>  Appropriate commemorative events are being planned to mark this year's important milestones in the history of Ireland's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations by the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civilian personnel.</p>  <p>  A State ceremony will take place in Dublin Castle on Sunday 24th June 2018. Arrangement are currently being finalised and details of this event will be published shortly.  It is intended that the ceremony will be an occasion to show our pride in those who have served in our name in U.N. peacekeeping missions such as UNIFIL, while also calling to mind those who gave their lives so  that others might know the gift of peace.</p></reply>

It comprehends the Government&rsquo;s policy on defence of the State from armed aggression, the defence contribution to domestic security, the defence contribution to international peace and security and a broad range of other &ldquo;non-security&rdquo; roles which the Government require the Defence Forces and Civil Defence to undertake.  It considers the defence capabilities required so that the Defence Forces can successfully deliver on the roles assigned by Government.  Finally, the White Paper also considers implementation and the actions required to ensure that defence planning and provision processes are further developed.</p><p>During scoping of the White Paper implementation programme, 88 actions or projects were specifically identified.  These actions represent a subset of the totality of the work being carried out as part of the implementation programme for the White Paper.  While it is currently intended to have all 88 projects initiated or completed by the end of the ten year implementation programme, work in certain areas will continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are fully implemented and to assure that positive outcomes endure and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation. </p><p>To date, 37 projects have been initiated with 10 more projects due to initiate during 2018.  Of these, 5 projects have been completed and closed/transitioned to normal business including Projects 5 and 22.  </p><p>The Permanent Defence Force has levels of personnel turnover that exceed other areas of the public service and there is ongoing recruitment to replace personnel who depart.  This is not a new development and is a feature of military organisations. This has not impacted on either of the projects referred to.</p><p>The following sets out a progress summary in relation to projects 5 and 22.  </p><p><table><tr><th>Number</th><th>Project Name</th><th>Summary Statement</th></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Engagement with the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI), the Planning and Review Process (PARP) and the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC)</td><td>The project objective was for Ireland to continue to engage with the Partnership Interoperability Advocacy Group (formerly CFI), participate in the Planning and Review Process (PARP) and have joined the Operational Capabilities Concept, Evaluation and Feedback (OCC EandF) programme.<br /><br /> <br /><br />As part of the OCC EandF programme, Ireland selected a unit for the inaugural force package for participation in OCC EandF assessment.  This is the first step in a two - year programme in which the unit will undertake two evaluations.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Ireland also completed a full cycle of the PARP process.  A lessons learned exercise was also completed to identify and improve this process.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Ireland continues to participate in the informal Partnership Interoperability Advocacy Group (PIAG) discussions and took over as PIAG Co-Chair in January 2018 for one year, and will fill the Executive Officer position from mid-2018 (July) to mid 2019.<br /><br /> <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Develop a new employment support scheme with the direct involvement of the Defence Forces</td><td>The White Paper gave a commitment to develop a pilot Employee Support Scheme (ESS).  The pilot programme for the scheme was conducted by 2 Bde in Gormanston in 2016.  Following successful evaluation of the pilot programme, the Minister approved a three year roll out of the Scheme (2017-2019), with up to 2 iterations of the programme to be scheduled each year.  2 iterations of the programme were held in mid and late 2017 (in Limerick and Gormanston).  Another iteration is scheduled for summer 2018 (June in Cork) and the 2nd iteration for 2018 is currently provisionally scheduled for later this year.  Funding has been secured from the European Social Fund for the iterations of the scheme outlined in the 3 year implementation plan.  As part of the roll out, it was agreed that a full review of the Scheme be scheduled for 2020 which would comprehensively evaluate &quot;Value for Money&quot; in relation to the Scheme.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

They will come back into force over a period of three to six months.  The US Government has also stated an intention to impose additional sanctions. It is difficult to estimate the impact these actions will have, at this early stage.  The EU and the other parties to the JCPOA are continuing to implement the agreement, and so the UN and EU sanctions on Iran, which were directly in force in this country and which were removed under the JCPOA, will not be re-imposed. The US sanctions which had caused the most difficulty for Irish firms seeking to do business in Iran were those in the banking and financial sector, and for the most part these were not suspended under the JCPOA and had remained in operation.  This had led to a continued caution by many European banks, including Irish banks, in handling funds originating in Iran.  This had undoubtedly slowed the regrowth of trade with Iran following the JCPOA. This will unfortunately continue to be a factor.   EU Ministers have already discussed with Iran these potential difficulties, and at the Foreign Affairs Council this week Ministers discussed options for protecting EU companies to the greatest extent possible. </p>  <p>  However, it cannot be ruled out that some business will be affected by US measures.  In the banking sector in particular the problem is principally one of commercial decisions by the banks themselves, based on their own engagement in the US financial market and their assessment of the risks of the US financial measures. </p></reply>

The decision on whether to provide banking services to customers by a bank is dependent on a variety of factors, including their own risk appetite and regulatory requirements.  In addition, it is important to note that banks are designated persons under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, and consequently have Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations to meet under that legislation.  A strict compliance with international sanctions is essential in this regard. </p>  <p>  In meeting their obligations, banks are required to adopt a risk based approach as to how they conduct their business and who they conduct it with.  The Central Bank of Ireland, as an independent financial regulator, has no role in the making of commercial decisions by regulated entities and it would be inappropriate for it to interfere or attempt to influence such decisions. </p>  <p>  While any difficulty experienced by an Ambassador or others is regrettable, as outlined above, it is not within my power or remit to intervene on a bank&rsquo;s risk based approach to business relationships.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-31a.147.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018053100069#WRC04500"><p>I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over the last number of years.  </p>  <p>  However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  As Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into their overall assessment of flood risk.  This information has been provided as part of the information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding).  The nature of this arrangement is such that it has led to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas.  For instance, the most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefiting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while there has been an increase from 66% to 77% of policies in areas benefiting from demountable defences including flood cover.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy should note that the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the above information flow and to improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  The working group allows for the sharing of relevant data on completed flood defence schemes.  In this regard, the OPW has also provided a significant amount of detailed data in relation to adequacy and resourcing of flood warning systems, and mobilisation, efficacy, maintenance and development of demountable defences to Insurance Ireland.  A sub-group has also been set up to explore the technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data.  </p>  <p>  One of the outcomes of these discussions is that the insurance industry has now acknowledged that they accept that the demountable defences meet the desired 1:100 year standard.  However it still maintains the view that while demountable defences are effective where correctly deployed, there are significant interdependencies, including human intervention, which increases the risk of failure.  This is subject to ongoing discussions.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. </p></reply>

The Roadmap takes a holistic view of pension issues and details specific measures presented under six strands. </p>  <p>  While implementation of the Roadmap is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and her Department, the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) was allocated a number of specific measures under the Roadmap.  The IDPRTG is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives from this Department as well as from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Revenue and the Pensions Authority. </p>  <p>  Strand 3 of the Roadmap is concerned with improving the governance and regulation of supplementary pensions to, among other things, achieve scale, improve standards and simplify the provision of pensions.  The actions allocated to the IDPRTG under the Roadmap derive in the main from Strand 3, and the terms of reference of the Group reflects this focus.  </p>  <p>  Action 3.13 of the Roadmap provides for a review of the cost of funded supplementary pensions to the Exchequer in the context of the development of a new auto-enrolment scheme.  The Deputy will be aware that relief on pension related tax relief represents a large and generous tax expenditure.  Ireland operates an &lsquo;Exempt, Exempt, Taxed&rsquo; or EET structure for pensions tax relief.  Under EET, and subject to certain restrictions, pension contributions and investment returns on pension funds are exempted from tax but pension drawdown is taxed at prevailing tax rates through the income tax system in retirement.  On this basis, it is considered that marginal relief represents a significant incentive to encourage pension savings and to a degree represents a deferral of taxation.</p>  <p>  The IDPRTG is currently considering this issue and will report by the end of the third quarter.  As Minister for Finance, tax policy is a matter for me and my Department, and the work of the IDPRTG will be considered in that context.  </p></reply>

The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs that address failures in the Irish SME finance market as well as encouraging competition, innovation and the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments.  The SBCI achieves this purpose through both on-lending and risk-sharing activities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the SBCI does not lend directly, rather it acts as a wholesale financial institution providing low cost, long-term wholesale funding to both bank and non-bank finance providers.  These partner financial institutions are known as on-lenders. These on-lenders must in turn pass on the benefit of that low cost finance to the final SME borrowers.  This is a key requirement in order for the SBCI to comply with state aid rules.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the SBCI that the process of engaging in an agreement with a new on-lender generally involves a potential on-lender completing a standard template business plan and due diligence questionnaire.  The SBCI then conducts a thorough and detailed assessment of the potential on-lender, including a consideration of its financial strength and repayment capacity; underwriting ability and credit risk management; operational capacity; and management and governance track record.  Ultimately, the final decision to enter in to an agreement with a new on-lender is made by the board of directors of the SBCI.</p>  <p>  The Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme that I announced in Budget 2016 and Budget 2017 respectively clearly demonstrate the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee model.  The finance providers chosen as financial intermediaries to deploy SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee schemes are selected via an open call process.  In each case, the open call sets out a scoring system against which each applicant is assessed on a number of criteria outlined in the open call document.  These eligibility criteria are determined by the requirements of the SBCI&rsquo;s funding providers, counter-guarantors, Government Departments involved in the scheme and relevant policy considerations.</p>  <p>  The SBCI operates on a market neutral basis.  The opportunity to obtain SBCI funding as an on-lender or act as a financial intermediary participating in the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee schemes is open to any finance provider that can demonstrate that it fulfils the SBCI&rsquo;s requirements through the rigorous processes that I have outlined.</p>  <p>  In this way, the SBCI aims to ensure on-lenders and financial intermediaries maximise the benefit and the service provided to Irish SMEs as well as protecting taxpayer money and the investment of both State and European institutions. </p></reply>

The CFRAM programme culminated with the launch on 3rd May, 2018 of 29 flood risk management plans which proposed 118 new outline flood relief projects, in addition to 42 major projects already completed, and 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW).  As it is not possible to progress all 118 proposed new schemes at once, funding of &euro;257 million for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country was also announced which would be progressed to detailed design and construction, including the five largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small or minor projects under &euro;1 million which will be progressed directly by local authorities.  Aside from the 5 largest schemes and the 31 small or minor projects, the remaining projects in the initial phase of implementation were selected on the basis of those projects which would provide the greatest benefit in terms of the largest number of properties protected on a regionally balanced basis.</p>  <p>  The proposed flood relief scheme at Ballina, Co. Mayo has been identified by the CFRAM programme to be progressed at a projected cost of &euro;8.2 million.  This proposed scheme involves the construction of a number of new quay walls and flood defences walls, together with two pumping stations, to manage surface water and fluvial flooding behind the river walls.  The scheme will protect 167 properties when completed.  The proposed scheme is in the first tranche of projects to be progressed, and the OPW is currently writing to all local authorities regarding arrangements for the progression of these prioritised projects.  While it is not possible to provide a definite timescale for the progression of the Ballina scheme, it is hoped that the process for appointment of consultants will be commenced in the near future.</p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress the scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies as well as the general public takes place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the scheme. </p></reply>

The Plan recognises that, at a national level, the Mill is of considerable historic and cultural significance due to the survival of its waterwheels, machinery, artefacts and documentary records, together with the social history of several generations of the Moran family who operated the Mill. </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has undertaken work at the site to conserve the buildings and their historic contents.  This has involved the repair of buildings, recording of artefacts, and storing and the cataloguing objects that are in a vulnerable condition, while also keeping the grounds maintained and generally securing the site.  Specialist advice has also been provided by external consultants in the areas of ecology, timber decay, industrial heritage and building preservation and this informs the conservation approach.  Important tasks undertaken to date have included re-roofing, installation of new doors and windows, together with the challenging task of removing the millstones from their rotten timber frames and recording and dismantling key parts of the mill machinery. </p>  <p>  The mill house garden and adjacent field are well-maintained, and recent works have been undertaken to remove silt and entrenched weed/organic matter from the mill pond and watercourse that had, over time, taken hold.  At present, the external of the main buildings is in a reasonable condition, but several areas in both the mill and the cottage will require further attention before the building can be opened to visitors. </p>  <p>  The key waterworks elements of the Mill still require significant intervention to restore the wheels to their former function.  An archaeologist has completed an inventory and a scope of works for the repair of the wheel and a detailed structural engineering assessment is underway to fully understand the challenges involved in progressing further with these elements.    </p></reply>

My Department arranges for the secondment of teachers from their teaching posts for the purpose of developing and providing CPD for teachers and for the appointment as Directors of Education Support Centres (ESC's). Members of my Departments inspectorate may also be seconded from my Department to take up positions as Directors of ESC&rsquo;s. Secondments are a temporary arrangement renewable on a year to year basis. While on secondment, teachers retain their school post, the terms and conditions that apply to teachers and receive their salary and a secondment allowance which are met in full by my Department.  </p>  <p>  In 2010, a new policy of secondment was agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform (DPER).  The policy sanctioned a new limit on secondment numbers and established an upper limit of 5 years on the duration of a secondment, following which the Directors return to their posts either as a teacher or an inspector. </p>  <p>  There are many benefits from the revised policy for teachers, their boards of management and the system as a whole.  Because an upper limit of 5 years now applies to secondments, there is:</p>  <p>   - confidence that the people involved in the delivery of CPD have recent experience of the curriculum and of the school environment</p>  <p>   - certainty about secondment parameters which assist individual secondees and their employers (i.e. ETB/school/Department) in planning</p>  <p>  There are more opportunities for people to take on career enhancing roles in the support services and the Centres. Teachers returning to their school after a period of secondment have the potential to enrich their school environment and they become eligible to take on subsequent secondment opportunities after a period back in their school.</p>  <p>  Regular turnover of seconded teachers is now an established practice with teachers returning to enrich their schools so the investment in their skills is not lost.  Since 2010, 11 Education Centres have successfully recruited new Directors and the work of the Centres has not been negatively affected. </p>  <p>  Section 37 of the Education Act 1998 provides the legislative basis for the recognition and regulation of Education Centres.  Section 37(6) of the Act makes provision to make regulations relating to a number of matters in Education Centre's such as the appointment of management committees, funding, staffing, provision of information to the Department &amp;amp; other operational matters. </p>  <p>  In September 2017, Regulation 394 for the appointment and secondment of directors of Education Centres were introduced. Appointments as Directors under these Regulations are made on a school year basis. Under the regulations, a person shall not be appointed as Director for more than 5 consecutive years whether or not the appointment was made before the coming into operation of the Regulations. A part of a school year shall count as a full school year for the purposes of any calculation under the Regulations. </p></reply>

The strategy recognises that a diverse range of strong, autonomous higher education institutions (HEIs) is essential to respond effectively to evolving economic and societal needs. The strategy includes the retention of institutional diversity as well as the consolidation of HEIs, as appropriate, including as technological universities, and increased collaboration between HEIs, both universities and institutes of technology, in regional clusters. </p><p>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) is allocating &euro;12m in 2018 to institutes of technology for the development of technological universities and other higher education landscape restructuring projects. Not all Institutes of Technology are currently part of the consortia which are seeking to develop proposals to attain technological university status under the 2018 Act. Section 29 of the Technological Universities Act 2018 provides that two or more Institutes of Technology may apply for designation as a TU. Section 38 provides that an Institute of Technology and a technological university may apply for TU status. </p><p>It is a matter for individual Institutes of Technology as to their positioning over time within the diversity of the higher education landscape. This process is currently being undertaken within the higher education system performance framework 2018 - 2020 which allows HEIs to identify their strategic niche and agree a performance compact aligned with funding with the HEA. </p><p>However, there continues to be a key role for individual Institutes of Technology in the provision of high quality education and training, whether technical in nature, apprenticeship focused, creative, research based or in relation to lifelong learning and also with an emphasis on providing appropriate progression pathways for students.  Many Institutes of Technology have a focus on, and a good<b></b>track record in, research, development and innovation and the strong links they continue to forge with industry play a pivotal role in driving regional growth and jobs. </p></reply>

However, almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the Scheme categories 1-6, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools,  for Gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works..  Details of the successful school applicants, are published on the Department's website . </p><p>In relation to the Summer Works Scheme 2018, over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for 178 schools nationwide to be completed. These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the Summer Works Scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the Summer Works Scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in Quarter 2 as in previous years.  This will also help ensure that works done under the Summer Works Scheme fits better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan.  The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of Summer Works projects for 2019.</p><p>The application from the school in question will be considered in this context.</p></reply>

Restoring capitation funding as resources permit is one of the actions included in the Action Plan for Education.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion.  Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  While the capitation rates for Primary and Voluntary Secondary schools have not increased in the period since 2016 the process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  A similar type approach in relation to improvements in grant funding was applied, as appropriate, at post-primary level. </p></reply>

The methodology takes account of output forecasts, in money terms, for various segments of the construction industry, the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) and the relationship between apprentice intake and employment trends in the sectors.   </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to doubling the number of new apprenticeship registrations by 2020 which will see 31,000 people starting an apprenticeship programme during the period. The Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 sets out target new registrations for each of the years to 2020 and targets for new apprenticeship programmes to support these registrations. In addition, the Plan sets out various actions, such as an additional calls for apprenticeship proposals, an apprenticeship branding and marketing campaign and a review to barriers to participation in apprenticeship all designed to drive registrations into the future. To date 11 new apprenticeship programmes have been developed in various new sectors of the economy ranging from international financial services to hospitality. In addition, arising from our second call for apprenticeship proposals last year, 26 new programmes were approved for further development into national apprenticeship programmes which have added to the pipeline of apprenticeships that are in development and to be rolled out during this and future years. As well as developments in new apprenticeships, as the employment and economic situation continues to improve, we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally during 2017 with 4,508 at year end, which represents a 20% increase on 2016.</p>  <p>  The annual targets for both craft and consortia led apprenticeships set out in the Plan in each of the years to 2020 were informed by the SLMRU forecasts in the craft trades and the Programme for Government commitments in the area.  The targets for consortia-led apprenticeships in the early years of the Plan were also informed by information on planned registrations provided by consortia who had been approved in the 2015 call for proposals. </p></reply>

The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth. Key findings within the report related to the high replacement/exit rates in the sector which has implications for the ongoing skill requirements of the sector and also with regards to staff retention, including education and training, and workplace conditions and remuneration.  </p>  <p>  The Study assessed skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings. The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020, including the need to establish a National Oversight and Advisory Group, comprising of key hospitality stakeholders, to provide a forum for on-going collaboration to support the needs of the sector and oversee implementation of the EGFSN recommendations.</p>  <p>   Established in 2016 and currently chaired by the Irish Hotels Federation the group identified five priority areas for progress on which significant progress has been made:-</p>  <p>  - Promoting careers in the sector</p>  <p>  - Audit of hospitality related courses and facilities in both HE and FET</p>  <p>  - Development of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes</p>  <p>  - Launch of a dedicated skillnet for the hospitality industry</p>  <p>  - Making employment connections &ndash; DEASP/Jobsbridge etc</p>  <p>  The group has published its first progress report which is available on the Skills Ireland website and work is currently underway on its second progress update. It has also published its report on the audit of both higher and further education courses providing a high level of analysis of the data available that shows the numbers of courses, enrolments and awards in the Hospitality sector to enable the Group to determine how it might address the skill sets required by the sector and to aid it in identifying gaps in the provision of courses.</p>  <p>  Arising from Government&rsquo;s commitment to expand apprenticeship and traineeship education, a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship has been developed by the Apprenticeship Council, led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry ETB. To date, 66 people have been registered on this programme with an expected full year intake of around 160. The Apprenticeship Council also approved development funding for separate proposals to develop a Chef de Partie and Sous Chef Apprenticeship, with expected intakes this year of 48 and 16 respectively. It is expected that the Chef de Partie programme will be rolled out later this year.  Separately, an Executive Chef apprenticeship is also in development. </p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was initiated by SOLAS in collaboration with the ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice. Networks have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers to identify training needs, design training programmes, recruit learners and deliver training on and off the job. There are currently three hospitality traineeships available with further traineeships in development.</p>  <p>  A Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet was established in 2017 and, along with the Taste 4 Success Skillnet, will address skill needs in the sector.  There were also almost 5,500 beneficiaries in 2017 of further education and training in the food and beverage and tourism areas. </p>  <p>  All further education and training programmes on offer are fully accessible to all EU citizens.</p></reply>

Furthermore neither the Courts Service nor my Department has any function in relation to the work programme of property arbitrators who are appointed by the Land Values Reference Committee and so the further statistical data requested by the Deputy cannot be provided. </p><p>The remedies available to a party in the event that an arbitrator is in default in carrying out his or her functions depend on whether the arbitration is governed by the Arbitration Act 2010 or any other regime.  The 2010 Act incorporates in Irish law, subject to the Act's provisions, the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration.</p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that it cannot be assumed that a delay in the completion of an arbitration is due to some default on the arbitrator's part.  Delays in the completion of an arbitration can occur for other reasons outside the control of the arbitrator, for example, an ongoing court case. </p><p>The Courts Service has further informed me that there is currently one full-time property arbitrator and seven temporary part-time arbitrators available to be nominated to act in cases in which the property arbitrator is unable to act and that the Courts Service is satisfied that this is sufficient to meet the demand for services in this area.  </p></reply>

The employment situation in the South-East, which covers Waterford, Carlow, Wexford, Kilkenny and South Tipperary, has been steadily improving in recent years with IDA client companies in the region creating 1,200 new jobs last year alone.  This translates as an 9.2% increase when compared to 2016 figures.</p>  <p>  The total employment in overseas companies in the region now  stands at  14,785 people across 75 client companies.  This figure represents 7% of all people employed in IDA client companies across the country.  Furthermore just over 12% of all IDA jobs created outside of Dublin have been in the South-East region.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the Agency will continue to build on this strong FDI  employment base in the coming months and years.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to Australia have grown significantly in recent years from &euro;203m in 2003 to &euro;2,818m in 2016 (the most recent year for which CSO figures are available).  </p><p>In 2017, Ireland&rsquo;s good exports to New Zealand were &euro;109m.  Services exports amounted to &euro;232m in 2016, the most recent year for which figures are available. Key goods exports include medical products and pharmaceuticals products, industrial machinery and dairy products.</p><p>In the FTAs with Australia and New Zealand, we will seek to include a chapter on services that should aim to remove barriers to international trade in services that should facilitate further growth.</p><p>My Department is currently in the process of undertaking a comprehensive study which will examine in depth the economic impact and opportunities of existing and forthcoming EU Free Trade Agreements, including the Australia and New Zealand FTAs.  The analysis from the study will inform the Department and relevant agencies in setting the policy framework required for Irish businesses to take full advantage of concluded trade agreements and preferential trade access, and to prepare for future opportunities; including Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>The EU is predicted to increase its exports to Australia and New Zealand by as much as one third if an ambitious and comprehensive Free Trade Agreement can be delivered.</p><p>EU exports to Australia of dairy and, to a lesser other food and beverages are expected to increase significantly. An EU-New Zealand FTA would result in a long-term increase of EU exports of non-ruminant meat e.g. pork; dairy; and to a lesser extent, other food and beverages. </p><p>The EU&rsquo;s Impact Assessment identified the main sectors in which EU<b></b>businesses reported experiencing problems accessing the market in Australia and New Zealand. These included agriculture and food products (beef meat, pig meat, dairy, processed food products, and alcoholic drinks).  While some agriculture products, in particular beef, are sensitive for Irish businesses the removal of these barriers to trade in Australia and New Zealand may also open export opportunities for Irish producers.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s analysis indicates growth of exports for all sectors apart from minor decreases of EU exports of some agricultural sub-sectors (rice, cereals, fruit and vegetables and fibres and other crops - all of these have low EU trade volumes).</p><p>Both New Zealand and Australia were among the 11 countries that signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in March 2018.  In light of the benefits that CPTPP offers its signatories it is important that the EU conclude its own trade deals with participating countries in order to ensure that Irish businesses are not at a competitive disadvantage. </p><p>While it is not currently possible to specify the date at which any agreement might come into effect, such agreements usually take a number of years to negotiate and a further one or two years for the so-called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo; of the text of the agreement.  In addition, depending on what is negotiated in respect of any particular sector or class of goods, there are often multi-annual phasing period for specific commitments.</p></reply>

A total of &euro;13.5m in funding has been committed by 46 industry partners to the new Centre. This new Centre will be an agent of growth for the Irish dairy industry by being a world leader in research for precision pasture-based dairying.  Since the Budget announcement, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has joined Science Foundation Ireland to co-fund the Centre.  The Research Centre will be launched and funding drawdown will commence later in 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of Budget 2018 Ireland committed to join the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in 2018. Negotiations were entered into in October 2017, Ireland&rsquo;s formal application is currently being set before the ESO Council.  As we intend to join ESO in the final quarter of this year, from October 2018, our total contribution for 2018 is &euro;0.75m. This includes the annual contribution on a pro rata basis. </p>  <p>  The benefits of membership of ESO are significant and include the creation of advanced enterprise relevant skills in areas such as data analytics, software and photonics.  </p></reply>

Arising out of the review, a recommendation was made to examine the treatment of business and farm  assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme. The Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. </p>  <p>  At present, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.

This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Any changes to the scheme, if approved by Government, will require amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. </p>  <p>  A Memorandum for Government setting out the details of the proposed policy change and seeking Government approval to draft the General Scheme of a bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 has been circulated to other Government Departments for observations.</p></reply>

Forest carbon measurement is overseen by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine based principally on the results of the National Forest Inventory.  Differences in species growth and productivity is captured in the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and reflected in the National Inventory Report. Results from the NFI indicate that the carbon stock in forest soils is the dominant component and accounted for 85.1% of the total carbon stock in the forest estate in 2012. Total living tree biomass amounts to 12.7% of the total carbon stock, while deadwood, including logs, stumps and standing dead trees along with litter constitutes the remaining 2.2 %. The total carbon stock in the living tree biomass in 2012 amounted to 48.5 million tonnes. The NFI results in 2012 indicate that Sitka spruce accounted for 53.8% of the carbon stock by species, Norway spruce 3.9%, pines 9.5%, Douglas fir 2.4%, Larch 3.2 % and other conifer species, which includes western red cedar, 1.4% . The National Forest Inventory is currently preparing results from the most recent survey and will be published in the near future.  </p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, including in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.</p>  <p>  There has been strong interest from Irish food and drink exporters in what have been increasing opportunities in the Gulf region - a market that has grown by over a third in the last 5 years, to a value of over &euro;400m in 2017.  Iran, with a population of 80 million people and a relatively wealthy middle class, has been identified by Irish exporters as a market worthy of further exploration. Against that background, my Department led a trade mission to Iran, along with Bord Bia and a number of Irish food manufacturers, in 2016. </p>  <p>  While at the moment I have no further plans to visit Iran at this time, the wider Gulf region does remain firmly in our sights.  I led a trade mission to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in February of last year.  Bord Bia, the body responsible for marketing Irish food, has an office in Dubai aimed at identifying and capitalising on opportunities for Irish food in the region, including Iran, on an ongoing basis.  The Irish Ambassador in Ankara, Turkey, has also visited Iran frequently, working both bilaterally and in cooperation with the state agencies in order to assist Irish companies exploring opportunities there.</p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 identifies competiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to &ldquo;improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and agri-food companies&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Recently I launched the new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; in cooperation with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance, which will provide up to &euro;300 million of affordable, flexible working capital finance to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) are administering the Scheme and use &euro;23million in public funding, along with the EIB Group&rsquo;s InnovFin SME Guarantee Facility, to leverage the loan fund. Given its significant exposure to the UK market, my Department has contributed &euro;9million, ensuring at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses. This is the only sector that has ring-fenced funding.</p>  <p>  The Scheme was opened on the 31st March 2018 and will remain open until 31st March 2020, or until it is fully subscribed.  The SBCI receives and analyses loan data from the participating banks on a quarterly basis and have informed my Department that the first official data relating to the Scheme will be available on completion of its first quarter, i.e. to 30th June 2018. </p>  <p>  This Scheme was modelled on the Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme, through which I made &euro;145 million of working capital finance available to farmers at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%. That Scheme was developed by my Department in co-operation with the SBCI in order to mitigate the effects of lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors in 2016 and 2017 and the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate arising from Brexit. </p>  <p>  I announced in Budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses and that &euro;25 million is available for this purpose. These schemes are developed and delivered in cooperation with the SBCI and take time to develop and operationalise. Consideration and discussions are ongoing in this regard and I will announce further details on this as they become available.</p></reply>

However, and as with any trade deal, there are also defensive interests in any future negotiations, and these must be balanced and have due regard to special sensitive sectors for Ireland, such as beef, sheep meat and dairy.   </p>  <p>  From an Irish agri-food perspective I will aim to protect vulnerable sectors such as agriculture by maximising the benefits of market opening without harming Irish producers. The mandates as they are do not envisage full liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, which are foreseen as benefiting from specific treatment. </p>  <p>  During the course of the upcoming negotiations I will, as with any Free Trade Agreement negotiations, insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish agri food sector, particularly its most sensitive sectors such as beef and dairy. This stance will be even more important in the light of the on-going Mercosur negotiations. I also believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market. </p></reply>

The CSIRT-IE received international accreditation in 2017 and is actively engaged in a number of European and international organisations. The NCSC is responsible for acting as a conduit for information to constituents including operators of Critical National Infrastructure, businesses, Government Departments and Agencies, and also for providing expert advice and analysis on cyber security issues and for coordinating significant incidents.  The NCSC acts as a central contact point in the event of a government or nation-wide cyber security incident affecting the State and continues to work with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Departments and Agencies that own these systems to mitigate and manage these risks. The expertise contained within the NCSC covers a broad range of capabilities including computer science, software engineering, malware analysis and information technology forensics.  The unit also participates in international exercises.  The NCSC is also engaged in a series of other actions to support organisations of different types and scales. For example, the unit has been heavily engaged in work to prepare for the EU Network and Information Security Directive, which will place binding security requirements on critical infrastructure operators and certain key Digital Service Providers.  The Directive also places obligations on the State itself, in terms of ensuring that States can cooperate and share information in the event of a large scale incident affecting several countries and to ensure that every State has significant capacity of its own. Taken together, this will mean that the State will have coordinated system for the management of cyber related risk to Critical National Infrastructure, and for the assessment and response to incidents.  Also, a new website for the NCSC has been launched &ndash; <i>www.ncsc.gov.ie -</i>and this will shortly be updated with information to assist individuals and small and medium sized businesses to protect their information systems. </p></reply>

I have listened carefully to the issues raised in relation to this project, particularly those living in close proximity to the proposed project. In February and March 2017, two motions calling for an updated independent study into the north-south interconnector were passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann. I met with the Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee and North East Pylon Pressure Campaign, together with Oireachtas members from Cavan, Monaghan and Meath in February 2017. I subsequently met with Oireachtas members in May 2017 and most recently again in January of this year. In addition, my officials have held separate meetings with the Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee and North East Pylon Pressure Campaign in March and April last year.</p>  <p>  All of these engagements &ndash; together with the motions - were important in my decision to commission two independent studies into the project. The studies were designed to address the main points of the motions as well as key concerns expressed by those parties opposed to the development of an overhead line. Some impacts such as environmental and health concerns were not assessed since the statutory planning process is the appropriate method by which such impacts are assessed and evaluated. </p>  <p>  The Consultants undertaking the two studies have finalised their reports and once considered in my department and submitted to me it is my intention that these will be brought to Government and made publicly available. This process will take some time to complete.</p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie.</i>This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:  </p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017.</p><p>There are approximately 42,0000 premises in Cavan. Some 17,000 (40%) fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention. More than 20,000 (49%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are, or will be, served by commercial providers, while nearly 5,000 (11%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment.</p><p>There are approximately 33,000 premises in Monaghan. More than 15,500 (48%) fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention. Just over 15,500 (47%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be served by commercial providers, while some 2,000 (5%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie.</i></p><p>Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. Figures for Q1 2018 are now available.</p><p>Data for Q1 2018 recently submitted by eir to my Department indicates that the company has passed some 145,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. Eir has signalled that there would be likely knock-on effects to the 2018 milestone targets due to the severe weather impacts of both storms Ophelia and Emma. I have met with the senior management in eir and expressed to them the importance of implementing measures to catch up with milestone targets as a priority.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.  </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure. The Department of Rural and Community Development maintain a list of Broadband Officers, a link to which is available on my Department's website at  <i>.</i></p></reply>

Today, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention for those areas where commercial operators are unlikely to invest.  The National Broadband Plan Intervention Strategy outlines various aspects of the proposed State led intervention. This document is available at <i>.</i></p><p>The Strategy recognises that access to quality high speed broadband enables people to access information, services and opportunities that may otherwise be out of reach.  To that end, the company appointed to build and operate the State led intervention network must deliver a wholesale high speed broadband network that is open on an equal access basis to retail service providers, with benchmarked and transparent pricing and conditions for access. It must also ensure that services are affordable, competitive and comparable to prices charged in areas outside the intervention area.</p><p>It is the intention that the wholesale prices charged by the company operating the network within the intervention area will be in line with the average published wholesale prices that prevail for comparable services in more competitive areas of the country or, in the absence of such published prices, prices already set or approved by the industry regulator, ComReg.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out the new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.

The new scheme will deliver capacity building supports for community-led projects, including financial, technical and legal assistance, along with community benefit obligations, for projects looking for support under RESS. This approach will deliver on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland. </p><p>Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to increase community ownership from renewable electricity projects has been undertaken. This study was carried out in  parallel with the economic analysis to underpin the new RESS, and it  examined which policies and support measures would work best in an Irish context, to deliver these ambitions. The assessment looked at international best practice, and a renewable energy &ndash; community workshop was held, where barriers and opportunities related to renewable electricity projects were identified for further analysis. The study also looked at how these policies and support measures could be best applied across a range of project archetypes, including developer-led, community-led and wholly owned community projects</p><p>Examples of support measures identified include a mandatory requirement for all projects supported under RESS to offer ownership or investment opportunities to the local population, facilitating grid access for community-led renewable projects, ring fencing dedicated capacity for community-led projects and putting in place structures which will support community groups overcome legal, financial and technical barriers to renewable electricity generation.</p><p>The Community Report as it is known, along with the Economic Appraisal to underpin the new RESS were both published by my Department last year for public consultation and are available on my Departments website at . </p><p>A final design proposal on RESS will shortly be brought to Government for approval, and subsequent to this a formal application for State Aid clearance with the European Commission will commence in line with 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines. The new scheme is expected to open in 2019. Over the coming months, my Department will work closely with all relevant stakeholder groups to ensure the delivery of the community commitments as far as possible as the scheme is developed. </p><p>Finally, the regulation of the electricity network, including the management of the grid connection process and related matters, is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory body, solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas, and I therefore have no function in the matter. </p></reply>

The first part concerns the reform of criminal law to provide for a range of new offences including "revenge porn", "upskirting" and "downblousing". My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality is preparing legislation to address this aspect of the LRC report.    </p>  <p>  The second part of the report concerns the establishment of an Office of a Digital Safety Commissioner. As the Deputy is aware, the Government did not oppose the Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in February of this year, which sought to establish such an Office. The D&aacute;il referred that Bill to the Select Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment for further consideration.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I hosted an Open Policy Debate on Online Safety which was organised in cooperation with six other Government Departments.

Accommodation was on a B&amp;B or half-board basis.  IFI succeeded the fishery boards in 2010 and as part of a strategic review of both operations and property it was considered that operating a guesthouse was not part of the organisation&rsquo;s core business.  A tender process was undertaken for the accommodation facility to be operated on a commercial licence basis.</p>  <p>  Following the tender process, IFI entered into a licence arrangement with a private company from 2015.  It was intended that the income derived would contribute to fisheries conservation, protection and development.  The Lodge (and the Erriff fishery) remained in State ownership.  IFI retook possession of the Lodge in 2016 due to non-compliance with the licence terms by the licensee.</p>  <p>  The Board of IFI then considered a number of options in relation to the property and communicated its preferred choice to sell the property and retain the Erriff fishery in State ownership.  An examination by my Department of the options presented concurred with the Boards view.  I indicated my support for the proposed sale in June 2017.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that retention of the Fishery as a State asset is, in my view, essential in view of the following: </p>  <p>  - the Fishery is the National Sea Trout Index Catchment on which significant National and International scientific research is based;  </p>  <p>  - retention facilitates the provision of angling for Salmon and Sea Trout to domestic and visiting anglers at economic rates; and </p>  <p>  - the scientific, amenity and community value of the Fishery.</p>  <p>  IFI intends, in line with its property rationalisation plans, to establish a new operational base and updated scientific facilities, for the strategically important Erriff Fishery and the immediate area, on adjacent lands which it owns and are also being retained. </p></reply>

Furthermore, micro generation will be required given the scale of our climate and energy ambition as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040. While solar power is not supported by REFIT, my Department supports the deployment of Solar PV through the SEAI led Better Energy Communities and pilot Deep Retrofit schemes.   Last year, my Department assessed micro generation, across a number of renewable electricity generating technologies (including solar PV), as part of the economic analysis to underpin the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The assessment identified technical and financial challenges which may need to be addressed before a broader support scheme for micro generation can be introduced. This is in line with international experience, including across the EU, where many member states who have introduced supports for micro generation have had to reform them or cancel them altogether. </p>  <p>  The reality is that bringing micro generation on to a system designed for large generators is complicated. It impacts how we pay for the network, how we manage regulation and how we technically manage the system. My Department is continuing to work closely with the micro generation sector and the SEAI to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner.</p>  <p>  Solar PV and self-consumption among domestic customers will be supported under a pilot scheme to promote micro generation, due to be launched later this year. It is important that before a scheme like this is introduced, the likely demand for the scheme is understood and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are currently undertaking a study which will inform the final design of this pilot. It is equally important that safety, technical and training requirements are established in advance of this pilot scheme being rolled out. </p>  <p>  The data gathered during the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro generation in Ireland that may be appropriate, as we align with the ambition of the recast Renewable Energy Directive which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers. This pilot scheme will deliver on ambitions and commitments made in the Energy White Paper and the Programme for Government.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-31a.502.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018053100075#WRJ03900"><p>Climate change presents a very significant challenge, the scale and complexity of which is not underestimated by this Government.The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development sets out an ambitious long-term commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and in parallel, to pursue an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. </p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, the EU has committed, on behalf of its Member States, to a reduction of at least 30% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, to be achieved by reductions in the Emission Trading System (ETS) sector of 43% and in the non-ETS sector of 30%. The recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of non-ETS emissions by 2030.</p><p>Closing the gap on Ireland's EU targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and 2030 will be extremely challenging. The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020, in the context of a target that emissions should be 20% below their 2005 levels. While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, and the consequent increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. </p><p>The projected shortfall to our target is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. With this in mind it is crucial that the focus of our efforts must now be to ensure that we, at the absolute very least, meet our 2030 target. </p><p>As a means to addressing Ireland&rsquo;s emissions reduction challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July 2017. It has established the framework for the development and implementation of medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of its four key sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). The Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. </p><p>I subsequently published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework in January 2018. The Framework sets out the national strategy to reduce the vulnerability of the country to the negative effects of climate change and to avail of positive impacts. Under the Framework, seven Government Departments and Agencies, with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework, will be required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and the Framework itself. </p><p>Implementation of both the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework is overseen by a High Level Climate Action Steering Group, which I chair and which reports, in turn, to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action. </p><p>Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. It will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant up-scaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework. </p><p>Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate mitigation, and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. </p><p>Both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan explicitly recognise that reliance solely on Exchequer expenditure schemes is neither affordable nor adequate to the scale of the challenge to be addressed, and climate mitigation action will require a targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change. In certain cases, taxation policy may have a stronger role to play in changing individual or business behaviour and investment decisions, including harnessing non-Exchequer finance. </p><p>I will also shortly publish an update on climate mitigation policy to coincide with the <i>Empowering Communities for Climate Action </i>event on 20 June, which will reflect the significant policy developments since the National Mitigation Plan, in particular with the publication of the National Development Plan.  </p><p>In terms of on-going climate mitigation policy development, the EU requires that we produce a draft National Energy and Climate Plan by end 2018, with the final plan to be developed by end 2019. This represents a further opportunity to build on the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan to ensure Ireland moves to a pathway of long-term decarbonisation. Finally, I am required, under the 2015 Act, to bring forward a new National Mitigation Plan at least once every five years. The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.  </p></reply>

The objective of the National Mitigation Plan is to set out, on a whole-of-Government basis, what Ireland is doing and is planning to do to further our transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. The Plan reflects, in particular, the central roles of the Ministers responsible for the four key sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use), and draws on the perspectives of a range of other Departments. </p><p>Furthermore, each Minister is responsible for implementing the sectoral mitigation measures within their own sectors and for taking forward the actions to further develop those measures. Each Minister is also directly accountable and must report to the Oireachtas, under the 2015 Act, on progress in their respective sectors. </p><p>The most recent list of measures currently in place in the context of National Mitigation Plan is set out in the 2017 Annual Transition Statement, which I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 December last. This Statement details the key measures in place in the respective sectors, the objective for each measure, estimated mitigation potential and funding information, where appropriate.</p><p>It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy. This process will enable it to be amended, refined and strengthened over time and assist in keeping Ireland on target to meet our obligations. </p><p>Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocates a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. </p><p>I will shortly publish an update on climate mitigation policy to coincide with the <i>Empowering Communities for Climate Action </i>event on 20 June, which will reflect the significant policy developments since the National Mitigation Plan, in particular with the publication of the National Development Plan.  </p><p>In terms of oversight and implementation, both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Adaptation Framework are overseen by a High Level Climate Action Steering Group, which I chair and which includes representation from relevant Government Departments and Agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This Steering Group reports, in turn, to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action. </p><p>In relation to the potential of carbon sequestration to contribute to compliance with our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, the recently-agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation includes provision for net removals and emissions from deforested land, afforested land, managed cropland and managed grassland to be taken into account for a country&rsquo;s compliance with its targets, under certain conditions. On the basis of current estimates, under this provision, Ireland is expected to be able to account for up to 22 million tonnes in net removals over the 2021-2030 period in partial compliance with our targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group which I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator. </p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce.  Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme.  Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The fifth meeting of the Taskforce Implementation Group was held on 25 April 2018, and the Quarter 1 2018 Progress Report has since been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  This report offers progress updates on all Q1 actions.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:</p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for deployment of telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.  This exercise is ongoing under the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme.  It is planned to have dedicated Geographic Information System (GIS) resources in place to support this.</p>  <p>  - A review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots.  A focus group is continuing this work in 2018, to inform future policy development and initiatives.  The work of this focus group will provide guidance on location categories where high quality mobile phone coverage should be made available as a priority, taking account of customer expectations.</p>  <p>  - ComReg is also developing a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and awareness raising activities, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Providing telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator.  I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations.  The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.</p></reply>

The Government's National Broadband Plan aims to ensure high speed broadband access of a minimum of 30 megabits per second to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location through a State led intervention and commercial investment.  </p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. The Map is colour coded and is searchable by address or eircode.  I also signed a  Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  As of end March this year eir has passed 145,00 premises and has committed to completing this rollout.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at the <i><font color="#2F2F2F">fibrerollout.ie</font></i>website.</p><p>The procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State led intervention area is now in its final stages.  My Department will engage with the successful company on the most efficient rollout of the network.</p><p>In the interim, high speed broadband services continues to be rolled out through significant commercial investment by commercial operators to a value of &euro;2.75 billion in the last 5 years.  By 2020, 9 out of 10 premises the length and breadth of Ireland will have access to high speed broadband.  </p><p>For those premises awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p></reply>

Energy efficiency will also realise benefits for air quality, health, social inclusion, business competitiveness and better public services, all of which will make a real and positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives.Ireland&rsquo;s White Paper on Energy Policy, <i>Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030,</i>National Mitigation Plan (NMP) and Long Term Renovation Strategy (LTRS) all recognise the fact that extensive renovation of our building stock will need to take place in order to meet both national and international targets for energy savings and emissions reduction by 2050. This must occur across all sectors. </p><p>I secured significant additional resources in Budget 2018 for energy efficiency investment. I allocated &euro;117 million, of which &euro;107m is capital, to the energy efficiency programmes to increasing energy efficiency across the residential, public and commercial sectors with a view to ramping up activity in order to address the ambition of the NDP.This represents an increase of over &euro;50m since 2015 (or 34%).My Department works closely with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, who administer the energy efficiency programmes, to profile spend across all programmes for the year. The bulk of spend on energy efficiency programmes has historically taken place in the second half of the year and I would expect this to be the case this year as well. </p><p>My Department and the SEAI are also working to further encourage the uptake of the respective programmes by engaging with various stakeholders.  An important element of this is SEAI&rsquo;s new Behavioural Economics Unit which was established in 2017.  Its focus is to better understand the motivations of key decision makers so policy interventions can take advantage of new communications insights.This Unit is already informing improved effective communication with target groups and has provided guidance to market players on how to more effectively communicate to decision makers the benefits of making more energy efficiency choices.</p><p>The spend to end April 2018 across these sectors is outlined below.

The O.C.I. is an independent, autonomous sporting organisation.</p>  <p>  In the context of the State's funding of the O.C.I., which was suspended in 2016 and resumed in the latter part of 2017, I sought to ensure that the necessary reforms were undertaken in order to address the Moran Inquiry recommendations. In particular, I was satisfied that all twenty five recommendations in the Deloitte report, as referenced in Report from Judge Moran, were addressed. Additionally, the conclusion of the O.C.I.&rsquo;s commercial relationship with the THG company drew a line under the unacceptable ticketing arrangements detailed in Judge Moran&rsquo;s Report. In summary, I believe that there has been a complete transformation in the openness, transparency and accountability of the O.C.I. when compared to the situation before the Rio Games.</p>  <p>  As with all sporting organisations, in receipt of State funding or otherwise, it will of course be necessary for the O.C.I. to maintain its commitment to the highest governance standards and to ensure that it puts athletes at the forefront of their thinking and planning. I am confident that the significant reforms already undertaken by the OCI will deliver a vastly different and better experience for Team Ireland at Tokyo 2020. </p>  <p>  Judge Moran commented on the extensive resources of the O.C.I.&rsquo;s parent body, the International Olympic Committee (I.O.C.), in relation to future State funding of the O.C.I. I understand that the Board of Sport Ireland would take this into consideration in regard to the allocation of funding. In that context, the Deputy may wish to note that it is an aim of the O.C.I.'s Strategic Plan 2018-2024 to become financially independent. </p></reply>

There are very few examples remaining in Europe of institutional structures that jointly provide air navigation services and oversee industry regulation.</p>  <p>  The objective of the reform initiative is to create a single national aviation regulator responsible for economic, safety and security regulation, and separately a sole commercial air traffic control service.  There is inherent conflict in  the IAA&rsquo;s current dual role as a commercial air navigation service provider and an independent regulator of the airline industry, including regulator of air navigation services. This reform initiative is about implementing best practice regulatory arrangements. It is intended to further promote Ireland&rsquo;s position to the forefront of change and development in the aviation sector.  It will further improve the existing high level of safety oversight as borne out by the audits of the IAA undertaken by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.   </p>  <p>  I recognise that such structural reform involves a number of complexities and I am mindful of the need to manage the transition to the new arrangements carefully, including the enactment of supporting legislation in as diligent and expeditious a manner as possible. It is important to ensure that affected workers and the broader industry stakeholders are kept informed, and regular consultation to that end will be a feature throughout.  It is equally important to pursue the implementation of policy that represents clear best practice, all the more so when safety is at issue, rather than shy away from necessary change in favour of the status quo or vested interests. </p></reply>

The Central Statistics Office (CSO) provides statistical information on cycling, including the National Travel Survey which illustrates the prevalence of cycling and the trends in cycling numbers. </p>  <p>  My Department also monitors cycling numbers and trends using information collated by Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority and published in the annual Canal Cordon Report.  This report provides data on trends in mode share of vehicles and people crossing the Canal Cordon including the number of cyclists who pass the canal cordon in Dublin between 7.00am and 10.00am;  The recently published report shows an upward trend of cyclists crossing the canal that continued between 2016 -2017 with numbers increasing by 3%.  There has been a steady year on year growth in the number of cyclists crossing the cordon since 2010. In 2017 almost 12,500 cyclists crossed the cordon in the AM peak period.  This represents an increase of 157% when compared with 2006, and represents an increase of over 57% in the last five years.  Clearly cycling numbers have shown a steady increase in recent years.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as part of my Departments overall strategy to increase the numbers cycling I have secured over &euro;110m in capital funding which is specifically allocated to develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford over the period 2018-2021.  This programme will provide "active travel" (i.e. cycling and walking) routes, which can help alleviate congestion by improving the viability of these particular forms of travel, and doing so in a way that provides useful connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure. In addition to this, &euro;55m will be spent in this same four year period on Greenways outside of the 5 cities, and the greenway programme will be largely aimed at providing an enhanced tourism and leisure amenity.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;135m capital funding has been allocated over this same period for investment in Sustainable Urban Transport projects.  These will include projects that will provide either direct or indirect improvements for urban cycling.  This programme builds on investment to date to deliver improvements in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the regional cities and the GDA.  It includes traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects, which will allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and will help relieve traffic congestion. . </p>  <p>  Furthermore, investment in the BusConnects Programme in the same period, will deliver a transformative investment package that will finance new and expanded bus routes, greatly improve bus access, and includes designated segregated cycle lanes.  NTA calculate, that through BusConnects, over 200 kms of cycle tracks/lanes will be either built or current lanes improved upon.</p>  <p>  In addition to funding for the provision of infrastructure, my Department continues to be active in promoting behavioural change to encourage more people to take up cycling and to cycle safely. Funding is provided on an annual basis to the NTA for the delivery of behavioural change programmes such as Workplace and Campus Travel Programme and the Green Schools Travel Programmes.  My Department also engaged Cycling Ireland to develop a new national cycle training standard - "Cycle Right" &ndash; which was rolled out in January 2017.  My Department also supports the great work that is being done by RSA in the promotion of safe roads for all road users, including the more vulnerable users such as cyclists and pedestrians.  In addition my Department provides funding to local authorities throughout the country to assist in organising events and activities during Bike Week which further serve to promote cycling.</p>  <p>  As part of an overall coordinated approach to the provision of an integrated sustainable transport network of cycling, walking and public transport, these various investments will support and lead to a further increase in the numbers cycling safely, thereby easing congestion, improving public health and enhancing the liveability of our towns and cities; the investment will, I believe, have a lasting transformative effect on our transport network over the coming years.</p></reply>

Rates of pay are primarily a matter for childcare practitioners and their employers.  However, the annual Early Years Sector Profile, published by Pobal, contains useful information on pay including pay rates for the various positions in the sector and county breakdowns of pay rates.  The profile also includes information on staff qualifications, staff turnover and the length of time staff spend in a service.  A copy of the most recent Early Years Sector Profile is available to read and download on the Pobal website <i>www.pobal.ie </i>under the &quot;news and events&quot; section.</p><p>As part of the Early years sector Profile, each service which took part was asked to provide the average hourly wage for each staff member.  The results are presented in the table below.<table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Average Hourly Wage</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>&euro;12.81</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>&euro;12.41</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire   Rathdown</td><td>&euro;12.36</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>&euro;12.27</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td>&euro;12.17</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>&euro;12.17</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>&euro;12.08</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>&euro;11.99</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>&euro;11.95</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>&euro;11.90</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>&euro;11.87</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>&euro;11.83</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;11.77</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>&euro;11.75</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>&euro;11.73</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;11.70</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>&euro;11.69</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>&euro;11.62</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>&euro;11.53</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>&euro;11.48</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>&euro;11.47</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>&euro;11.47</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>&euro;11.43</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>&euro;11.30</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>&euro;11.21</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>&euro;11.19</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>&euro;11.14</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>&euro;11.14</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>&euro;11.05</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>&euro;10.95</td></tr></table></p><p>On the broader issue of pay rates, I am conscious of the need for improvements to be made and, in this regard, I have suggested to the sector that one approach which might be considered is to apply for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) through the Labour Court. </p><p>Under a SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders.  My Department would not be a party to the SEO process, however, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the matter of the application for a SEO for the sector.  I have indicated that I will be very supportive of any reasonable measures aimed at improving pay and conditions of the Early Years sector. </p><p>Further, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to carry out an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare.  The 'Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare' which is currently being carried out is examining the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare, including a survey of childcare providers.  Following completion- the review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning future policy development and investment in early years. As such, it will feed into future policy development, including in relation to levels of payments to services.</p><p>The contract to undertake this Review was awarded to Crowe Horwath in September 2017.  Since then, a literature review, stakeholder engagement and an online survey has been completed.  The closing date for receipt of completed surveys was 13th April. Over 800 completed surveys were received and analysis of these data has commenced.  A report from this Review is expected in late June 2018.  It is intended to publish this report thereafter.</p></reply>

These scheme subsidies are deducted from the cost to the parent of the childcare they require.  The ECCE / pre-school scheme provides early years care and education to 117,000 children approximately per annum.  DCYA is not the employer of staff in the sector and makes no payments directly to them. Childcare services are delivered predominantly by private businesses and about 30% by community  / not for profit services. </p>  <p>  The subvention rates for the September 2017 measures which were introduced as an interim measure in advance of the ACS were increased substantially in September 2017, by as much as 50% in some instances.  The rate of capitation for ECCE will increase by 7% from September 2018, up to a maximum of &euro;80.25 per child per week for services receiving the Higher Capitation rate.  The subsidies for the Affordable Childcare Scheme which is in development were designed to include all overhead costs ( face to face time with children, admin costs etc.). </p>  <p>  An important point to note is that my Department made  &euro;18 million in Programme Support Payments (formerly known as 'non-contact time' payments) to Early Years providers in 2017 and has secured this in our base for 2018.  We plan to administer this payment again in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I have commissioned the first Independent Review of the Cost of Delivery of Quality Childcare, which is currently being conducted by Crowe Horwath.  The outcomes of this review will inform us re all costs associated with delivering childcare and will be critical to future Estimates processes  relating to early years care and education. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the general position set out it is estimated that the cost of providing an additional 3 hours paid time, based on the numbers working in the formal, settings based, early years sector and having regard to current pay rates in the sector, would be in the region of &euro;50m.</p></reply>

My Department has been keenly aware of the robust progression of ECEC as an academic discipline in Ireland, which is now far more firmly established in Irish third level institutions than at any previous time. </p>  <p>  The rapid growth of ECEC in recent years is partially attributed to my Department's provision of an additional payment to graduate-led Early Years services who offer the ECCE programme, and it is to the credit of the third level institutions and ECEC academics that they have responded so proactively to the increased demand for degree level ECEC programmes in Ireland.  My Department anticipates that the Early Years sector in Ireland is very near to being 50% graduate led.  </p>  <p>  Throughout the various changes brought forward by my Department in the Early Years sector in Ireland in recent years, my Department has maintained regular contact with third-level institutions who offer Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) programmes, through various forums. My Department works very closely with the Department of Education Early Years Policy Unit, who are currently undertaking a review of the award standard for ECEC degrees, and have done so through extensive consultation with the third level sector, including groups such as PL&Eacute; (Pedagogy, Learning and Education Association of Ireland). </p>  <p>  My Department is aware, (through third level education providers; associated academic groups; and other stakeholders such as the County / City Childcare Committees (CCCs)) of the challenges facing third level students in ECEC programmes, particularly those who do not qualify for Student Universal Support payments. To further support ECEC graduates, in January 2017 my Department began to offer a bursary payment for recent ECEC graduates, which has continued into 2018. My Department is also examining other means of offering support to ECEC undergraduates who fall outside the mainstream financial supports for students.  Officials from my Department are also in regular contact was ECEC undergraduate students, as many apply to my Department for permission to work in the sector outside of their academic placement work, a permission that my Department is pleased to provide, subject to application and some key criteria.</p></reply>

This indicated that some 27,000 staff work in the formal childcare sector, half of which are working full time, and that the average hourly rate of pay in the sector is &euro;11.93. If  we were to take the mid-point of the Teacher salary scale as a benchmark for professional wage standards, the estimated cost of introducing such standards to all staff in the centre based / formal childcare sector would be in the region of &euro;605m per annum. </p>  <p>  The allocation for schemes in 2018 totals &euro;411m. On the estimated basis that 70% of this amount contributes to pay costs, the additional funding required would be approximately &euro;320m per annum. </p>  <p>  Several important considerations must be noted alongside this analysis. While the Department is a significant funder of the childcare sector, the Department is not the direct employer of childcare workers. The costings above relate to formal childcare settings only and not to the estimated 38,000 childminders working in home based childcare. The costings do not include pensions.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that any move to impose or change pay levels to any degree would need to be the subject of a wide ranging negotiated process with employers, the sector, and other relevant stakeholders. </p></reply>

The procurement process for the external IT developer for the project is nearly complete, and when the developer is in place and has been able to validate the timeline for completion of the project, I will then announce the planned start date.</p>  <p>  I have already publicly stated that the existing childcare schemes, including the benefits which were fast-tracked in September 2017, will remain in place for the programme-year starting this September. As the Deputy may be aware, these have been very successful and our target has been exceeded. Almost 77,000 children are now benefiting from these schemes; the target had been 70,000.</p>  <p>  The most recent estimates for the full-year childcare costs of the ACS were presented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, which was published in December 2017. The Regulatory Impact Analysis noted that there remains considerable uncertainty over the likely costs of the ACS, especially because of uncertainty about the scheme's impact on the demand for childcare.</p>  <p>  According to the Regulatory Impact Analysis, if there is no increase in demand for childcare, then it is estimated that the full-year costs will lie between &euro;127m and &euro;149m. Taking into account potential increases in demand, international evidence suggests that the full-year cost of the scheme could rise to somewhere between &euro;165m and &euro;193m. However, such an impact on demand may only materialise fully over a period of several years, as parents begin to participate more in the labour market in response to improved access to affordable childcare. Increase in demand may also be caused by parents changing their childcare choices towards regulated childcare.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the ACS will see a significant change in eligibility criteria for childcare subsidies. Whereas eligibility for childcare supports under the current schemes depends on possession of a Medical Card / GP Visit Card, or receipt of one of a range of social welfare payments, or participation in a relevant education or training course, the level of subsidy under the ACS will primarily depend on income. In addition, a universal subsidy was introduced in September 2017 for 6-36 month olds, which will remain in place under ACS.</p>  <p>  I have no immediate plans for changes in ACS eligibility criteria, but the scheme has been designed to give flexibility to adjust both income-thresholds and subsidy-rates each year as part of the budgetary process.  This ensures that the ACS can act as a sustainable platform for increasing investment in childcare in Ireland over the years ahead.</p>  <p>  In line with the costings published in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, it is estimated that the number of beneficiaries of ACS on its introduction could rise to more than 82,000, but is likely in the first instance to be between 70,000 and 80,000, with the precise level depending on the impact on the demand for childcare. As income-thresholds and subsidy-rates are changed over time, the number of beneficiaries will change accordingly. </p></reply>

The increases in supports to Childcare providers which have been provided from September 2017, for the next programme year, represents a major step towards accessible affordable quality childcare after decades of neglect and under-investment by successive Governments. These 'September measures' include the following supports which are being rolled out under the CCS and TEC Schemes; </p><p>(1) A new (non-means tested) universal subsidy is available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they qualify for ECCE) in registered childcare. This amounts to as much as &euro;20 a week or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare. </p><p>(2) Enhanced supports of up to &euro;7,500 per year to assist families to return to employment and/or training and education.</p><p>As of week ending Friday 25th May 2018 a total of 76,933 children have benefited from these measures.

Each LAG is responsible for deciding how their allocation is distributed to LEADER projects over the duration of the programme, based on the objectives in their Local Development Strategies.  </p><p>As of 21<sup>st</sup>May 2018, 973 projects with a value of &euro;28 million had been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs while a further 342 projects with a value of &euro;19 million are at various stages in the approval process.

My Department has responsibility for any associated social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  Maternity benefit and paternity benefit are paid by my Department and are based on payment of PRSI contributions while working.  The current entitlement to paid maternity leave is 26 weeks and paid paternity leave is 2 weeks for which the Government has provided funding of approximately &euro;264 million and &euro;16 million respectively for in 2018.</p>  <p>  The estimated full year cost of introducing an additional week's entitlement to paid parental leave based on the rate of maternity benefit which could be taken by either parent would depend on the cohort of parents who would avail of it.  For example, one additional week of maternity benefit would cost approximately &euro;9.6m while one additional week of paternity benefit would cost &euro;5.2m.  If the leave could be taken by either parent then the estimated cost would be between &euro;5.2m and &euro;9.6m.  Similarly, the cost of extending this paid leave by three months (13 weeks) would cost would between &euro;67.8m and &euro;124.8m.</p>  <p>  These estimates are based on the cost for a full year at the current minimum rate of &euro;240 per week for both maternity and paternity benefit and assume that any increase in duration is implemented from the beginning of the year.</p>  <p>  This costing is subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2018.  It should also be noted that there are additional costs to the Exchequer as these estimates do not include the costs of salary top-ups for public/civil servants. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These six strands are: </p>  <p>  Strand 1 - Reform of the State Pension including the Total Contributions Approach; </p>  <p>  Strand 2 - A New Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings System; </p>  <p>  Strand 3 - Improving Governance and Regulation including the EU IORPS II Directive;</p>  <p>  Strand 4 - Measures to Support Defined Benefit Scheme Sustainability; </p>  <p>  Strand 5 - Public Service Pension Reform; and </p>  <p>  Strand 6 - Supporting Fuller Working Lives. </p>  <p>  From these strands stem a total of 43 individual actions, each action having a specified owner and date of delivery.  Given the wide breadth of actions included under the plan, action owners separately include three Government Departments, two Government agencies, a public body and some interdepartmental structures (where policy responsibilities span a number of departments).  Accordingly, a number of governance structures have been developed to oversee progress with development and implementation.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately these individual arrangements and progress generally on the implementation of these reforms is being overseen by Government through Cabinet Committee A &ndash; Economy, which is chaired by the Taoiseach and consists of Ministers with responsibility for pension related matters.  As is normal, this is supported in turn by a Senior Officials Group comprising senior officials from the relevant Departments. </p>  <p>  In delivering on the actions contained within the reform plan, extensive engagement will be undertaken with sectoral interests including employer and employee representatives, advocate groups, the pensions industry and the general public.  To this end, I can confirm that separate national consultation processes will be undertaken in relation to the two most fundamental reforms contained in the Roadmap.  These are the introduction of the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; for the State pension contributory from 2020 and the development of a new automatic enrolment retirement savings system for employees without supplementary pensions coverage.  This process has already been initiated with the recent launch of the Total Contributions Approach national consultation.  It is anticipated that submissions and feedback received from all interest groups over the coming months will help inform the design of both of these systems.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard.</p>  <p>  Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including 3,500 homes targeted using the Repair and Lease Scheme (RLS), and 6,500 homes using a combination of the existing social housing leasing arrangements, and the new Enhanced Leasing Scheme. All homes delivered under leasing arrangements will be funded under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  Exchequer funding for SHCEP in 2018 is &euro;115m &ndash; an increase of &euro;31m over 2017. It is intended that up to 2,000 units will be leased by Local Authorities in 2018 through the range of leasing schemes in place.</p>  <p>  The new Enhanced Leasing Scheme has been developed by my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the Housing Agency and local authorities, in order to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives. The Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.   </p>  <p>  The scheme will be governed by my Department and operated by local authorities. The Housing Agency will manage and administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and will act as a national co-ordinator.  The rollout of this scheme will result in no additional costs to the Exchequer, with costs being met from existing budgetary allocations for Rebuilding Ireland.</p>  <p>  A call for proposals was launched on 31 January 2018 and the Housing Agency accepted submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018. All proposals are subject to a range of criteria as set out in the &ldquo;Calls for Proposals for Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme&rdquo; and the proposals will be assessed and marked in accordance with the terms set out therein. This document sets out the various assessment stages and the expected minimum associated timeframes (Appendix 4). The Call for Proposals is available on the Housing Agency website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie/News/Current-News/Enhanced-Long-Term-Social-Housing-Leasing-Scheme.aspx.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Housing Agency that of the 33 submissions received: 3 are proceeding to Independent Valuation; 12 are currently awaiting further information from the proposers; 14 are not proceeding due to failure to meet with the minimum requirements of the scheme; and 4 are not proceeding due to being invalid submissions / failure of suitability test. </p>  <p>  The total number of units proposed and delivery dates are still being worked through as part of the assessment process and will be the subject of an agreement between the individual Local Authorities and proposers.</p>  <p>  Further information with respect to the numbers and locations of the units proposed for leasing under the Scheme will be available when the individual proposals have been assessed, marked and accepted in accordance with the terms and methodology set out in the Calls for Proposals document.</p></reply>

Last year, the AHB sector delivered over 2,000 additional units for social housing use across the country and there is a strong delivery pipeline for 2018. This demonstrates the sector&rsquo;s commitment to work in partnership with local authorities to deliver the Government's ambitious targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p>Through local authorities, AHBs can access a range of funding streams to assist with the delivery of social housing, for example the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) with a Payment and Availability Agreement (P&amp;amp;A) or the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS). All funding schemes seek to secure value for money for the Exchequer and the highest quality social housing home for those on local authorities' waiting lists, including by ensuring that the local authority is fully supportive and approves of the project, necessity for independent valuations and a separate independent financial appraisal in the case of CALF proposals.</p><p>AHBs, with the assistance of local authorities, are securing single and multiple new build properties on a turnkey basis from developers. Similarily, where it is value for money to do so, AHBs will purchase vacant existing properities, on the basis that such a purchase does not interefere with the local market. In all cases, such purchases must be supported by the local authority and represent value for money in the context of local housing need.</p><p>The following tables provide information specifically on the AHB turnkey and acquisition projects comprising multiple units in one development, which were delivered through AHBs in the administrative area of Wexford County Council for 2016 and 2017. The capital costings of the units are averaged as a development could include a mix of unit type and size, e.g. two or three bed units, which are priced differently:</p><p><b>Table 1 - AHB Turnkeys - construction projects on private land</b><table><tr><th>AHB </th><th>Nr. of projects</th><th>Total number of units</th><th>Average Capital cost of unit</th><th>Year of delivery</th></tr><tr><td>CHI^</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>&euro;106,000</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>CHI</td><td>1* <br /><br />(Phases 1 &amp;amp; 2 )</td><td>18</td><td>&euro;175,710 </td><td>2016 </td></tr><tr><td>CHI</td><td>1*<br /><br />(Phase 3)</td><td>20</td><td>&euro;175,710 </td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>Tuath</td><td>1</td><td>11 (6 are Part V)</td><td>&euro;204,825</td><td>2017 </td></tr></table></p><p>*One project with phased delivery</p><p>^Co-operative Housing Ireland</p><p><b>Table 2 - AHB Acquisitions (of existing built units)</b><table><tr><th>AHB</th><th>Total nr. of units</th><th>Average Capital cost of unit</th><th>Year of delivery</th></tr><tr><td>Camphill</td><td>3</td><td>&euro;135,333</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>Cluid</td><td>19</td><td>&euro;77,421</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>CHI</td><td>4</td><td>&euro;76,032</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>CHI</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;160,000</td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>CHI</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;75,000</td><td>2017</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Plan sets out the actions that Ireland will take to improve water quality and achieve &lsquo;good&rsquo; ecological status in water bodies (rivers, lakes, estuaries coastal waters and ground waters) by 2021. The Plan is available at: www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-quality/river-basin-management-plans/river-basin-management-plan-2018-2021.</p>  <p>  The Plan provides a coordinated framework for improving the quality of our waters, protecting public health, the environment, water amenities and sustaining water-intensive industries, including agri-food and tourism, particularly in rural Ireland. The Plan sets out national policies and additional regional measures which are implemented on a prioritised basis.</p>  <p>  An enhanced evidence base has been developed to guide national policies and the targeting of priority measures. Technical assessments of 4,829 water bodies have been carried out, examining their status (quality) and whether they are &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of not meeting status objectives in the future. Informed by this work, a collaborative workshopping process involving the EPA, senior local authority personnel and all relevant stakeholders was set up to identify, at a regional level, those water bodies that should be prioritised for action during this planning cycle. Arising from this work, the Lough Sheelin catchment has been designated as a Prioritised Area for Action. </p>  <p>  Under the governance structure for the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive, local authorities are the competent authority for the implementation of the programme of measures contained in Ireland's River Basin Management Plan. In particular, the Local Authority Waters and Communities Office (LAWCO) is working with local groups and communities to help them play their part in protecting their waters. As such, LAWCO is the most appropriate body through which the Deputy's concerns should be pursued. LAWCO can be contacted via the www.watersandcommunities.ie website, or by email to info@lawco.ie. </p></reply>

In January 2018, the CRU held a public consultation on the development of the Policy for domestic and non-domestic connections to Irish Water&rsquo;s network, known as a National Connection Charging Policy. The Policy will be aimed at developing a more harmonised methodology for connections to the public water and wastewater network.</p>  <p>  The CRU as regulator is independent in this matter and will come to its own independent assessment of the appropriate Water Connections Charging Policy, having heard the view of interested parties through the public consultation process.  As Minister, I must respect the statutory powers and functions which the Oireachtas has conferred on the CRU in this matter.  It is anticipated that the new Water Connections Charging Policy will be finalised by the CRU in the coming months.</p></reply>

One of the key conditions of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is that prospective applicants must demonstrate that they have had inadequate loan offers from two commercial lenders. </p><p>To support prudential lending and consistency of treatment for borrowers, a Loan to Value ratio of 90% applies to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan as per the Central Bank's prudential lending guidelines. Therefore, in order to avail of the loan, applicants must have a deposit of funds equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property.</p><p>In the case of a self-build property, a loan can be made up to 90% of either the construction cost, or in the case where the site is also being purchased the construction cost plus the cost of purchasing a site. However, in both these instances, 90% of the loan being sought is the maximum amount that will be approved.</p><p>Applicants must provide bank or similar statements (such as post office, credit union, etc.) for a 12-month period immediately prior to making an application, clearly showing a credible and consistent track record of savings. The cash savings should be no less than 3% of the market value of the property. Gifts are permissible up to 7% of the market value of the property, where their source is verified. In the instance of a self build, it will be 3% of either the construction cost, or the construction cost plus the cost of purchasing a site.</p><p>Decisions by local authorities as to whether to advance a loan to an individual are taken on a case-by-case basis, within the criteria as set out in the credit policy. Each local authority must have in place a credit committee which makes the final decision on applications for loans. There is also an appeal procedure in each local authority so that those who are not satisfied with a decision regarding their application can have the decision reviewed.</p><p>For prospective purchasers of new-build or self-build properties, such as in the example suggested, the applicant may also be eligible for the Help to Buy Initiative for first-time buyers through the Revenue Commissioners. This could provide additional assistance of up to 5% of the purchase or construction price of relevant properties, which represents a significant contribution towards the relevant deposit requirements. A range of eligibility criteria applies to applications under the Help to Buy Initiative, and full details are available on the website of the Revenue Commissioners at .</p></reply>

Planning authorities will be issuing notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018, indicating that the levy will apply to those sites on 1 January 2019.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of relevant vacant sites, where a site exceeds 0.05 hectares in area, was, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, vacant or idle in the preceding year, and is in an area identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the vacant site levy provisions is a matter for each local authority, including the identification of residential and regeneration land as underpinned by the development plan process, and the identification of individual cases in accordance with the criteria set out in the legislation.</p>  <p>  As announced in Budget 2018, it is proposed to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020 in respect of sites included on the local vacant site registers in 2019. Legislative provision for this increase along with amendments to other relevant provisions will be tabled by way of Seanad Report Stage amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which has recently completed Seanad Committee Stage.  </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with planning authorities, keeps implementation of the vacant site levy under regular review, assessing whether additional clarification guidance or other reforms are required to ensure a consistent application of the levy. In this regard, and following an information seminar held earlier this month with all local authorities on experiences and best practice approaches in implementing the levy, my Department is preparing to issue further clarification, either through legislative amendment and/or specific guidance as appropriate, to planning authorities in the coming weeks, in relation to the application of the vacant site levy to farmland.</p></reply>
