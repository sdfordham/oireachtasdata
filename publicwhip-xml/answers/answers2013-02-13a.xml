It is important to emphasise the considerable progress made in recent years in encouraging parents to use alternative non violent forms of discipline in the family setting.  </p><p>  Recent official independent research undertaken by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs indicates that the practice of corporal punishment in the home setting is now relatively rare in Ireland.  This research indicates that the vast majority of Irish parents never use corporal or physical punishment as a means of disciplining children and opt instead for alternative means of discipline. I have asked my officials to forward a copy of this research to the Deputies office for his information.</p></reply>

The importance of the theme is underscored in recent policy documents such as EU Youth Strategy - Investing and Empowering Youth 2010-2018; Europe 2020; and in the recent EU Youth Report.  </p><p>  Building on a broad understanding of social inclusion as accommodating all young people and the range of issues they face, my priorities for the Youth Council Presidency are:</p><p>to promote understanding of the contribution of quality youth work to young peoples development , wellbeing  and social inclusion; and to explore the potential of youth policy ( as expressed through youth work and youth activities) to address the Goals of Europe 2020, particularly youth employment.  I will bring forward proposals for Council Conclusions on these two priorities for adoption by the Council of Youth Ministers in May.</p><p>These policy priorities are being advanced through the work of the Youth Working Party made up of officials of Member States. They will be also informed by the outcomes of the structured dialogue process between young people, youth representatives and policy makers following the EU Youth Conference to be held in Dublin 11<sup>th</sup> to 13<sup>th</sup> March, 2013.</p><p>  The EU Youth Conference is the flagship event in the Irish Presidency Youth programme. The conference is the culmination of the EU wide consultation with young people on the theme of social inclusion. It is estimated that over 12,000 young people will participate in national dialogues, at present underway, in member states. Following the national dialogues some 150 youth representatives will then participate in the EU Conference in Dublin next month, along with some 100 policy makers from member states and representatives of the EU Commission.</p><p>  Following the EU Youth Conference, Ireland will host an informal meeting of Directors&#8217; General of Youth from each member state.  Officials of the European Commission will attend and contribute to this informal youth policy debate and exchange of good practices relating to Ireland&#8217;s priorities.</p><p>  On 20th and 21st of June, I will host an expert round table event in Dublin that will explore further the role of youth policy in advancing employment for young people. The intention is to bring a new focus to the ways in which youth policy and the youth sector can bring new synergies and additional elements to achieve the goals of Europe 2020, in particular, in relation to youth employment. </p></reply>

This is borne out by recent research findings:</p><p>- My Department&rsquo;s 'Growing Up in Ireland' study has found how over 24% of 9 to 17 year olds have reported been bullied.</p><p>- The Anti-Bullying Centre in Trinity College has found how one in four girls and one in six boys in Ireland have been involved in cyber-bullying either as a victim, bully or both.</p><p>- Research commissioned by the GLEN (Gay &amp; Lesbian Equality Network) &amp; BeLonG To on the experiences of young LGBT people in Irish schools has found that 58% reported the existence of homophobic bullying in their schools.</p><p>  Bullying can have a terrible and corrosive impact on our children and young people, on their confidence, learning outcomes, self-esteem and mental health.  The affects of bullying can last for years. Sadly, in some case they can result in the loss of young lives. In recent times we have learned of a number of very tragic cases where bullying was involved. On behalf of the Government and on my own behalf I wish extend my sympathies to the families and friends of the young people who have died.</p><p>  As Minister for Children &amp; Youth Affairs I am committed to working with colleagues in Government to ensure that integrated policy responses to combat bullying are high on our agenda. The new Children First guidelines which I published last year now, for the first time, recognises the problem of bullying.</p><p>  Last month Minister Quinn and I launched the Action Plan on Bullying. This is the first plan of its kind and aims to address the serious impact of bullying on our children and young people. The publication of this plan is an important step in the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children and ensuring a safer childhood. </p><p>  The Action Plan recognises that as bullying is no longer limited to classrooms, we have to have a broader approach also. That means making sure that wherever young people are, they&rsquo;re protected by safety guidelines. It means making sure that wherever young people are, they are supported by an anti-bullying ethos and an Anti Bullying Framework. </p><p>  In line with the Action Plan, my Department will lead the development of Anti Bullying Framework to support young people, parents, schools, teachers and youth worker.</p><p>  The Anti Bullying Framework will be development and prioritised within the context of the new whole-of-government Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework which my Department is leading on and which is due be published later this year.</p><p>  My Department will work with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of an anti-bullying website, as recommended in the plan, to provide a single point of access to practical advice for parents, children and teachers to support them in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours, including cyberbullying. </p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools in tackling bullying and their need for support and guidance, The National Education Welfare Board, which now comes under my Department&rsquo;s remit, has issued guidelines requiring each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. Compliance by schools with this NEWB requirement is now inspected by Department of Education Inspectorate during Whole School Evaluations.</p><p>  In conclusion, my Department is committed to the fight against bullying and we will work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-13a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021300070#WRA01100"><p>The Government is committed to creating the environment for a strong economic recovery to support employment creation and jobs growth. Youth unemployment is a particular concern because of the difficulties it poses for young people themselves, their personal development and for social inclusion. The Government has a range of measures in place to tackle youth unemployment and these include initiatives in respect of education, training, job search assistance/work experience and support for job creation.   </p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have sought to highlight and promote the potential of youth work as part of the continuum of youth employment supports and I welcome the growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people.</p><p>  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout Ireland. Youth Work and non-formal learning, in its many programmes and activities can offer young people opportunities, including valuable volunteering opportunities, which can aide young people in acquiring new competences and skills and in turn enhance employability and job-readiness.</p><p>  This is particularly relevant in the case of young people who are otherwise marginalised from traditional services, such as those who are not in education, employment or training, the so called NEETs cohort. Existing youth work services already provide a significant level of engagement with this cohort and have the potential to provide a value-added not readily available from other activation programmes, through provision of outreach, intervention and bridging programmes focused on developing skill-sets and job-readiness.</p><p>  Already a number of Irish youth services have begun piloting innovative community-based programmes focussed on supporting youth employment.  My Department and I will continue to engage with the newly-established National Youth Work Advisory Committee and other Government Departments to explore how such initiative can be supported as part of the Government&#8217;s overall activation programme. Minister Bruton is currently finalising the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and in that context my Department is working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the inclusion in the plan of appropriate actions relating to the contribution of the youth sector in supporting youth employment, including through a greater focus on promoting and supporting volunteering opportunities.</p><p>  In line with the Ireland&#8217;s overall EU Presidency priority theme of &#8216;Jobs, Stability &amp; Growth&#8217;, I have sought to prioritise youth employment during my Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers. </p><p>  The Europe 2020 growth agenda emphasises the need to <i>&#8220;develop youth work as a resource to support youth employability&#8221;</i> while the current EU Strategy for Youth (2009) contains a key objective to   <i>&#8220;develop youth work as a resource to support youth employability&#8221;.</i></p><p>  With this is mind, Ireland&#8217;s Youth Presidency Programme includes a priority focus on maximising the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in particular with respect to supporting youth employability.  Work is underway on draft council conclusions which I hope will be agreed at the EU Council of Youth Ministers meeting in Brussels in May which I will chair. I also plan, as part of the Presidency programme, to host an expert round table event on quality youth work and its contribution to Europe 2020 and youth employment in June of this year.</p></reply>

The census numbers reflect the outcome of a process of reclassification of social workers within the HSE into various care groups, including children and families as part of the process of establishing the Child and Family Support Agency. </p><p>  HSE Children and Family Services will continue to apply discretion to the filling of social work vacancies in 2013, taking account of identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.</p></reply>

This exercise indicated that 99 people who had identified themselves to the Board as adopted, did not have a corresponding adoption file.  Around 45 of these cases related to people born after 1953 and the balance related to persons born pre-1953. Subsequently a further 20 applications from persons seeking access to the National Contact Preference Register (NCPR) administered by the AAI have fallen into this category.  In many cases they are aware that the details contained in the Register of Births are false and that their birth was registered incorrectly.</p><p>  The HSE has also had contact from a small number of people in similar circumstances where no adoption record exists  The HSE have referred those people to the AAI to encompass them in the review, add their details to the NCPR and provide assistance with information and tracing.  </p><p>  The AAI and HSE have attempted to identify and quantify the numbers of people whose registrations fall into these categories but further efforts are required to move beyond that and endeavour to trace birth parents, children and or siblings who are affected by this issue. Furthermore currently records related to such registrations, that may exist, are held by various agencies, some by the HSE and AAI, but also possibly  by private adoption agencies,  maternity hospitals, private individuals and other sources. </p><p>  This is a very complex and difficult issue  and I have recently met with a group of people who have found themselves in these circumstances. I have informed them of the actions I intend to take to address their current situation including asking the AAI and HSE to identify the legislative options for examining all records in existence or any other administrative assistance or including provisions in this regard in the forthcoming Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.</p><p>  When the former Adoption Board launched the National Adoption Contact Preference Register  in 2005, provision was made for persons, who were party to the illegal registration of a child, to register an interest in the Register for possible future contact with another party sometime in the future. Fundamental to the success of the NCPR is that any persons with information in this regard contact the Information and Tracing Unit of the AAI.  </p></reply>

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. </p><p>  This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The After-School Childcare Scheme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses. In 2013, my Department expects to spend over &euro;70 million on the CCS and CETS programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.</p><p>  My Department also implements the universal free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, under which all children have equal access to free pre-school education in the year before commencing primary school.  Some 66,000 children are currently availing of the ECCE programme which is expected to cost in the region of &euro;175 million this year. </p><p>  Future developments in the area of early childhood care and education, will be considered by my Department in the context of its National Early Years Strategy.  The Strategy is currently being developed within my Department and is expected to be completed later this year.  It is my intention that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life as well as identifying best practice in other jurisdictions.

In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining this universal programme and some 66,000 children are availing of it at this time.   The programme is expected to cost in the region of &euro;175 million this year.</p><p>  I am aware of the need to further develop the early childhood care and education sector.  However, any development that involves further pre-school provision would require considerable additional funding. I am also very conscious that work is continuing on improvement of quality within the pre-school year. All of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the provision is key to good outcomes for children.  In particular, I would like to see further progress in workforce development within the sector given the demands which expansion would place on the current pool of trained staff.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered in the context of the National Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to six  years, which is being developed by my Department and expected to be completed later this year.  </p></reply>

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of publishing the Heads was to allow for a full consultation at an early stage in the developing the Bill. I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report in July 2012 and my Department has examined the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee. Among the many issues examined by the Committee were:</p><p> - The inclusion of emotional abuse</p><p> - Inclusion of childminders as a named individual</p><p> - Problems associated with appointment of a volunteer as a designated person including that it could deter people from volunteering</p><p> - Concern about complexity and additional responsibilities placed on the Designated Officer</p><p> - Issues surrounding identification of an 'organisational unit ' where the organisation is part of, or affiliated to, or federated to, a national organisation</p><p> - concern that legislation focused on reporting where this was not found to be the main problem in reviews of child abuse and child death cases</p><p> - Capacity of HSE to implement legislation</p><p> - Inclusion of reporting of  retrospective abuse</p><p>  Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging need to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of both policy and operational issues as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives.  It is my intention to ensure consideration of these complex issues is completed and revised proposals are submitted to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.</p></reply>

This matter is currently being progressed in my Department.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the  HSE has provided information on aftercare to my Department, to guide the development of policy to underpin the strengthening of legislation for services in this important area. The HSE responded to my Department at the end of November in relation to the key findings of the National Implementation Group and provided information on the current provision of aftercare, assessment of need, multi-agency working and the HSE policy regarding Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991, which provides that the HSE must take all reasonable steps to make suitable accommodation available to a child who is in need of accommodation. The response of the HSE provides an important update on the significant progress in developing aftercare supports, the development of greater consistency nationally and the challenges in making supports available to individual young people, including the need for multi-agency cooperation and the need to take account of the views of those leaving care who, ultimately as young adults must wish to avail of the aftercare arrangements being made available. I have arranged for my officials to forward a copy of this response to the Deputy today.</p><p>  The annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million.There are currently 42.2 whole time equivalent aftercare workers in the HSE. In addition, the HSE commissions aftercare services from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care. The most recent information available indicates that there are 1,387 young people in aftercare, the majority of whom are aged 18-19 years. Since November, I have received additional information regarding young people who were in foster care and I was advised by the HSE that approximately 640 young people aged 18 and over are living with their foster carers and are being supported financially by the HSE. A further 110 of the young people in aftercare are living in supported lodgings. Supported Lodgings are provided to young people in care and in need of accommodation and support aged between 16 and 18 years, who cannot live at home but are not yet ready to live independently. Supported Lodgings is a term used to describe when a young person lives with an adult or family in a domestic home and is provided with accommodation, care and support appropriate to their age and needs. Persons providing this service are fully assessed and monitored.</p><p>  The HSE National Aftercare Service which is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document, commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. An intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group, comprised of NGO groups representing aftercare, child advocacy, foster care and other groups, was established by the HSE to monitor progress in implementing the national policy.</p><p>  The HSE has reported on the key findings of the National Implementation Group's review of aftercare provision. The review has shown that there is now a more systematic approach to ensuring that young people around age sixteen are identified through the care planning review process for assessment and through care planning. A standardised aftercare planning template is now being utilised nationally and this approach is helping to identify young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, earlier and has led to good examples of interagency working.   There have also been improvements in the statistical information available with additional new data being provided. While an aftercare service is provided across all areas, variations in how this is delivered and the level of aftercare allowances have been highlighted by the Group.</p><p>  The National Policy and Procedures Document sets out the eligibility criteria for an aftercare service. The care planing review process identifies young people as they approach 16 years and a process of assessment commences at that point, in conjunction with the wishes and views of the young person. Each individual's strengths and need for support is assessed across a number of areas, including whether they will continue to live with foster carers for a number of years after reaching age 18. The assessment also looks at life skills and capacity to live independently in the short and longer term; relationships with family, carers and significant others; emotional and behavioural development; health and overall wellbeing; identity and very importantly, educational/training requirements. </p><p>  Given the particular difficulties some young people experience in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension, which is particularly important in the context of the HSE Children and Family Services' transition to the Child and Family Support Agency. Protocols are being developed with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care to support this approach. A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. In addition, a protocol with the Housing Authorities which will set out a clear framework for identifying quality aftercare accommodation and commit local authorities to consider the needs of young care leavers is in the final stages of preparation. </p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of aftercare service and the issue is under ongoing active consideration by the National Implementation Group. My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people. </p></reply>

The CCS programme is available to qualifying parents in some 950 community childcare services and costs in the region of &euro;40 million per annum.  The CETS programme is available to qualifying FAS trainees and VEC students in some 1,600 community and commercial services across the country.  In addition, my Department implements the universal free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, at a cost of &euro;175 million per annum.</p><p>  A new School Age Childcare initiative was announced in Budget 2013 as part of a packet of measures to support children and families.  It will be implemented as a joint venture by my Department and the Department of Social Protection.  Under the initiative, over 6,000 after school childcare places will be made available for children of parents availing of employment opportunities.  My Department has been given a full year allocation of &euro;14 million to provide for the scheme which is expected to be piloted in the coming months and fully rolled out in September 2013. </p><p>  I believe there is significant international evidence of the benefits for children's outcomes of the provision of quality education and childcare in the earliest years. Childcare services also make an important economic contribution through direct employment of staff in service delivery and through support for labour participation on the part of working parents. </p></reply>

The effects of bullying can last for years, and tragically bullying has contributed to the loss of young lives.  My Department&#8217;s report on the State of the Nation&#8217;s Children: Ireland 2012 found that on average, 27.3% of children  reported being bullied at school at least once in the past couple of months. I am committed to working with colleagues in Government to ensure that integrated policy and service responses to combat bullying and reverse these trends are high on our agenda.</p><p>  On January 28 of this year along with my colleague Minister Quinn I launched the Action Plan on Bullying, a report produced by a working group which examined the issue of bullying in schools. As the first plan of its kind, the Action Plan on Bullying aims to address the serious impact of bullying on our children and young people. The publication of this plan is an important step in the Government&#8217;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children and ensure a safer childhood. The working group has reviewed evidence based research on bullying, consulted with leading academics in the field of bullying and reviewed the current best practices in bullying prevention<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>  in other jurisdictions. </p><p>  The Plan recommends a range of evidence based actions together with a timetable for their implementation to help us deal more effectively with bullying. My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills, and the Implementation Group being established by that Department, to oversee the implementation of the plan.  My Department will ensure that actions recommended by the Anti-Bullying Working Group are prioritised in the Children and Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework to be published later this year. This will be a cross-Governmental strategy for children and young people and I expect that it will further assist in promoting a common approach to the challenge of combating bullying.</p><p>  My Department will work with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of an anti-bullying website, as recommended in the plan, to provide a single point of access to practical advice for parents, children and teachers to support them in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours, including cyberbullying.   In recognising the lead role of schools in tackling bullying and their need for support and guidance, I have asked my officials to engage with the Department of Education and Skills and the education partners to explore any clarifications to the Children First Guidelines that may be required to further assist schools.</p><p>  My Department is committed to the fight against bullying and we will work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

The &quot;<b>Report of a Survey on Young People's Body Image</b>&quot; which I launched in 2012, marked an important milestone in giving young people a voice on this very important issue for them.  This survey was carried out directly on foot of a key recommendation from D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g 2010, a representative forum for young people which is overseen by my Department.</p><p>  At the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g 2010 assembly, the delegates considered the importance of body image to teenagers' mental health.  Noting the lack of national data on teenagers' body image, they decided that this was an issue worth researching.  The survey was completed by 2,156 young people and gives new insights into how teenagers perceive themselves in an area of critical importance to their mental health.  The Survey found that body image is a burning issue for young people in Ireland with 77% of participants ranking body image as important to them. 57% of the young people surveyed expressed some level of satisfaction with their body image which means 43% were dissatisfied.</p><p>  The promotion of self esteem and a positive body image in young people is a complex issue requiring inputs from a wide range of stake-holders including parents, schools, the media, commercial organisations and the Health Service Executive (HSE) through its Health Promotion Programmes.  My Department supports the National Youth Health Programme which is a partnership between my Department, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the HSE.  The programme aims to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion /  education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.</p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes.  The issue of self esteem and body image is addressed as part of a holistic approach to health.  It is covered under the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack delivered to youth organisations. The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway. Mindout is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people, looking at the ways they cope, ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.  Mindout adopts a universal mental health promotion approach which has strong links with the &quot;Support for all&quot; element of the recent guidelines on Mental Health Promotion for Schools published by the HSE, Department of Education and Skills and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</p><p>  The National Youth Health Programme also offers a Specialist Certificate in Youth Health Promotion. This programme is accredited by NUI Galway and adopts a whole organisational approach to health promotion. It focuses on a holistic model of an individual's health and youth work as a valuable setting for health promotion.  Further actions naturally extend beyond the remit of my Department. My Department is currently leading the preparation of a new Children and Young People's Policy Framework which will represent a whole of Government approach to addressing issues affecting children and young people including their well-being.  </p></reply>

It will be the overarching Framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.  </p><p>  The views of a wide range of interests including children themselves will shape the development of the Policy Framework and it will be informed by the following inputs:</p><p>- the results of a consultation in 2011, which focussed on children and young people, in which almost 67,000 people throughout the country participated, the analysis of which was published recently;</p><p>- a public consultation of the general public conducted during the Summer. Over 1,000 submissions were received as part of that consultation.  An analyst contracted by  my Department is in the process of analysing  these submissions and this process is expected to be completed in April;</p><p>- the advice of the National Children&#8217;s Advisory Council which represents a range of statutory and non-statutory organisations working with children and young people. The Council will continue to advise my Department on the Framework until a draft is submitted to Government; and</p><p>- the views of the National Children&#8217;s Strategy Implementation Group which includes nominees of Government departments and State agencies which develop policies and deliver services for children and young people.</p><p>  My Department is also in the course of meeting with other Government Departments to discuss aspects of the Framework which will impact particularly on their areas of policy responsibility.  This process is expected to be completed by the end of next month and, on completion of the analysis of the public consultation, the Policy Framework is expected to be finalised and published in the middle of this year.</p></reply>

A recent EU study to examine the safety of children on the Internet found that 4% of children between the ages of 9 and 16 in Ireland experienced online bullying compared with an EU average of 6%. I am committed to working with colleagues in Government to ensure that integrated policy and service responses to combat bullying and reverse these trends are high on our agenda.</p><p>On January 28<sup>th</sup> of this year, I along with my colleague Minister Quinn launched the Action Plan on Bullying, a report produced by a working group which examined the issue of bullying in schools.  The working group on which my Department participated was chaired by the Department of Education and Skills.  The publication of this plan is an important step in the Government&#8217;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children and ensure a safer childhood. </p><p>  The working group reviewed evidence based research on bullying, consulted with leading academics in the field of bullying and reviewed the current best practices in bullying prevention<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>in other jurisdictions.  The Working Group also consulted with a range of public bodies, community and voluntary bodies and other stakeholders involved in combating bullying.  A full list of the 68 bodies and individuals that provided input is available in the Appendix to the Action Plan on Bullying available on the Department of Education and Skills website.</p><p>  The Action Plan recommends a range of evidence based actions together with a timetable for their implementation to help us deal more effectively with bullying.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills, and the Implementation Group being established by that Department, to oversee the implementation of the plan.  </p><p>  My Department will ensure that actions recommended by the Anti-Bullying Working Group are prioritised in the Children and Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework to be published later this year. This will be a Governmental strategy for children and young people and I expect that it will further assist in promoting a common approach to the challenge of combating bullying. </p><p>  The development of the Policy Framework involves consultation between by Department and key stakeholders including other Government Departments, youth sector interests and children and young people themselves, all of which will inform the priorities of the Framework, which is expected by the middle of this year.  </p><p>  My Department will work with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of an anti-bullying website, as recommended in the plan, to provide a single point of access to practical advice for parents, children and teachers to support them in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours, including cyberbullying. </p><p>  The Plan provides advice for parents and young people with regard to the problem of cyberbullying.  In particular, it acknowledges that it is essential that parents and young people themselves understand how to use modern technologies safely; they must understand the risks associated with the cyber world and protect themselves outside of school hours in their homes and communities.  The Action Plan provides advice for parents on protecting their children from cyberbullying.  I would encourage parents and young people to avail of the advice on , an online collection of internet safety resources.</p><p>  I would further direct the Deputy to the Office for Internet Safety, an Executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The office has responsibility for the development and promotion of strategic actions to promote the highest levels of internet safety. </p><p>  My Department is committed to the fight against bullying and we will work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

A Special Care Unit provides secure residential service to children and young people who are in need of specialised targeted intervention. Children are detained  if their behaviour is deemed to pose a risk to themselves.  The detention, by order of the High Court, of a child in a Special Care Unit is considered as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable.</p><p>  There are three designated special care units in the country where children are detained on order of the High Court.  There is a unit in Ballydowd in Dublin, which has a capacity of ten beds and is fully occupied, another in Gleann &Aacute;lainn in Cork, with a capacity of four beds and which currently has three children placed there, and Coovagh House in Limerick, which a capacity of three beds and is fully occupied.</p><p>  Additionally, there are two National High Support Units in Ireland, Rath Na n&Oacute;g in Castleblaney and Crann&oacute;g Nua in Portrane, both of which have capacity for six young people.

The initial focus of this review was to consider the capacity requirements for the National High Support and Special Care Service.  I am advised by the HSE that a Capital Building Project with the HSE Architectural Services commenced work in late 2011.  Stage 2 of the design programme led to planning applications being lodged at the end of 2012.</p></reply>

This Report contained full details of the implementation status of each of the 99 actions specified.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's queries regarding outstanding recommendations, the latest information is that contained in the Third Progress Report mentioned above.  This indicates that of the ninety-nine actions detailed in the Plan, 37 actions had a timeframe of &lsquo;ongoing&rsquo;.  These are, by their nature, not once off actions and while they may be deemed complete for the purpose of the Report, they will necessarily continue to be implemented on an ongoing basis.  The remaining 64 actions had a specific timescale. An indicative overview status of the actions in the Plan is as follows:</p><p>  Complete: 59</p><p>  Implementation ongoing: 13</p><p>  Not yet complete: 27</p><p>  The 99 actions identified in the Ryan Implementation Plan are the responsibility of a number of Government Departments and Agencies.  In order to effectively monitor implementation, I chair a High Level Monitoring Group with representation from relevant Departments, the HSE, HIQA, the Garda&iacute; and the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.</p><p>  The Implementation Plan for the Ryan Report specified a four year reporting period.  The final phase of implementation, in 2013, will therefore focus on bringing each of the recommendations to full implementation.</p></reply>

The Department was established in June 2011 with a mandate to put in place a unified framework of policy, legislation and provision across Government in respect of children and young people.</p><p>  The responsibilities of my Department encompass a wide range of policy and service activity, both direct and indirect, for children and young people in Ireland.  It has a complex mandate, comprised of a number of separate, but interrelated strands including:</p><p>- the direct provision of a range of universal and targeted services;</p><p>- ensuring high-quality arrangements are in place for focused interventions dealing with child welfare and protection, family support, adoption, school attendance and reducing youth crime;</p><p>- the harmonisation of policy and provision across Government and with a wide range of stakeholders to improve outcomes for children, young people and families.</p><p>As outlined in my Department's Statement of Strategy, in order to achieve its goals, my Department works in close partnership with other Government departments, statutory agencies and non-governmental organisations on a range of cross-cutting issues in relation to both policy and provision as they relate to children and young people.  The scope of this collaboration includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p>- Department of Education and Skills (e.g. early childhood education, numeracy/literacy and skills development); </p><p>- Department of Justice and Equality (e.g. crime prevention, community sanctions, detention, diversion and equality); </p><p>- Department of Health (e.g. disability; health promotion, including nutrition and drugs policy); </p><p>- Health Service Executive (e.g. child welfare and protection, care and social services);</p><p>- Department of Social Protection (e.g. social inclusion, income support and the activation agenda); </p><p>- Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (e.g. employment creation and youth entrepreneurship); </p><p>- Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (e.g. UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and Council of Europe measures);</p><p>- Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (e.g. initiatives involving sustainable development and communities).</p><p>  While responsibility for support services for children with extra needs will remain with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills, as appropriate, my Department will continue to work closely with those Departments.</p><p>  The 2013 estimate includes an allocation of &euro;443m for my Department which represents an increase of &euro;16m over the 2012 allocation and this clearly demonstrates the continuing commitment of this Government to the  ongoing development of quality and effective services to support children and families.</p></reply>

What is important is that children in crisis, no matter where they are, have access to 24 hour social work assistance, and this is what the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services and I are working towards. </p><p>  Two out-of-hours pilot projects, one in Donegal and the other in Cork, were commenced by the HSE in 2011.  The Donegal project started mid-year and the Cork project started in the third quarter.  Both projects were internally evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College Dublin.  The HSE has reviewed the recommendations of the Evaluation Report and is committed to further development and expansion of the service subject to resourcing and the terms of the Croke Park agreement.  In this regard, a business case for a National Children and Families Services Emergency Out of Hours Social Work Service has been prepared and a copy submitted to my Department.  I have been informed by the HSE that talks with the relevant staff representative association are also underway.</p><p>  It should be noted that at present the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service, and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service.  The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years.  The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow).  Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Gardai, hospital and ambulance service personnel.  The Emergency Place of Safety Service, operates outside the greater Dublin area, whereby Gardai can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours.  This service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  As part of this service Gardai have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.</p></reply>

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. </p><p>  This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The School Age Childcare Scheme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.  In 2013, my Department expects to spend over &euro;70 million on the CCS and CETS programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.</p><p>  Officials in both my own Department and the Department of Social Protection are currently working to finalise the details of the scheme and its operational arrangements.  As is the case with the CETS scheme, the new scheme is expected to be open to both community and commercial childcare providers across the State and it is anticipated that places will become available on an interim basis from early 2013 with the full roll-out of the programme commencing in September 2013.

This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to low income and/or parents on social welfare;  and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides payments towards the weekly cost of childcare places for trainees and students deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S and the VEC.   My Department also provides the funding that supports the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which gives one free pre-school year to all children before they commence primary school.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013 I, together with my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, was pleased to announce a new After-School Childcare initiative which will be targeted at low-income families and supporting parents availing of employment opportunities.  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 quality after-school places for children attending primary school, as well as supporting parents to take up employment.  Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families when seeking to avail of work opportunities. There are currently in excess of 100,000 children being supported under the above programmes. </p><p>  I recently launched three evaluation reports on the Early Learning Initiative and I am aware of the positive impact of this programme on children and families in the communities where this programme operates. However the priority for my Department is to ensure that the childcare support  programmes that I have outlined above and in which considerable investment has already been made, continue to be delivered from quality settings and are available to the many children throughout the country that need them.  </p><p>  I was in a position to approve funding of &euro;31,500 for this initiative from my Department's National Lottery allocation last year.  </p></reply>

This level of funding represents an increase of &euro;16m over 2012 allocation and consists of &euro;417 million in current expenditure and &euro;26 million in capital expenditure.  In addition, Budget 2013 provides for &euro;546 million in the Health Service Executive Vote (HSE) for 2013 in respect of Children and Family Services. This consists of &euro;545 million in current expenditure and &euro;1 million in capital.</p><p>  The maintenance of the budgetary provision for child welfare and protection services at a time of wider curtailment in public expenditure reflects the priority attached by Government to this area.  The potential provided by these resources will be further strengthened in 2013 through reform and the establishment of the new Child &amp; Family Support Agency. This will involve moving the child welfare and protection services out of the HSE and creating a new statutory body which will also encompass both the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency. Under the Government&rsquo;s reform programme, we are moving to a situation where child and family welfare is the sole focus of a single dedicated State agency, overseen by a single dedicated Government Department</p><p>  The funding allocated to my Department is providing for the retention of schemes and services during 2013, including retention of the universal free Pre-School Year, as well as the introduction of a number of important new initiatives and developments.  These include: a new School Age Childcare initiative with full year funding of  &euro;14 million, which will provide over 6,000 after-school places for children in primary school to support parents in low-income families to take up employment; a new &lsquo;Area Based Approach to Child Poverty&rsquo; initiative with a funding allocation in 2013 of &euro;2.5 million; and the provision of &euro;20.4 million  in capital funding to further develop the National Children Detention Facility at Oberstown and end the practice of detaining 17 year old boys in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</p><p>  The initiative relating to School Age Childcare is a joint initiative with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.  It is hoped to pilot the scheme in the coming months with a full roll-out from September 2013.  The new scheme will augment my Department&rsquo;s existing programme of childcare supports for low income parents, which with this additional funding will now amount to over &euro;88 million.  This programme includes the existing Childcare Community Subvention (CCS) and Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) schemes.  These are in addition to the universal free pre-school year which has a separate budget of &euro;175 million.  Extending childcare provision has been a key priority for me and this initiative shows how Departments are working together to deliver on this Government&rsquo;s agenda to promote employment and to support children&rsquo;s development.</p><p>  The new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which supported projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour.  We know that early intervention improves life chances for children and families.  This is even more true in communities with high levels of disadvantage and joblessness.</p><p>  I particularly welcome the provision in Budget 2013 of &euro;20.4 million in capital funding, to enable the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown to proceed.  Since assuming responsibility for the children detention system in January 2012, I have worked with my colleagues in Government on a range of actions to end the practice of detaining children in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. The provision of new the facility in Oberstown, which is expected to be completed in 2015, will deliver all detention services for children in a single location which will maximise the scope for ensuring best practice standards and improving operational efficiency.</p></reply>

Governments have in fact carried out this role in other Referendums since the <i>McKenna</i> Judgement, including in the Lisbon and Stability Treaty referendums. The Government has welcomed the fact that the Supreme Court in the <i>McCrystal</i> Judgement has provided, for the first time since 1995, some guidelines on the application of the important McKenna principles.  </p><p>  In relation to the Children's Referendum, the Government aimed, through its information materials, to encourage the maximum public debate on, and participation in, the referendum. In doing so, it was conscious of an acknowledged gap in information that can attend referendums. The Government considered that in preparing information materials, it was paying appropriate regard to the McKenna principles. </p><p>In its Judgement of 11th December, 2012, the Supreme Court found that the Government at all times acted in a <i>bona fide</i>   manner. It noted that not everything in the advertisements, information booklet and website was objectionable under the McKenna principles. However, the Supreme Court found that the cumulative effect of matters identified in these materials contravened the McKenna principles. The failures identified by the Supreme Court are fully acknowledged and greatly regretted.</p></reply>

The Policy Framework is expected to be published in mid 2013 and will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland&rsquo;s first Children&rsquo;s Strategy which was published in 2000.  This is relevant to the National Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework. </p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is already under development and is expected to be completed and published later this year.  It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, including physical and mental development, vaccination programmes and population health issues such as nutrition and exercise, as well as parenting and  family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education, including literacy and numeracy.</p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the 'Growing up in Ireland' study.  It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Interventions Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources.  The major programme of institutional change which is currently underway, including the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, will also be taken into account.</p><p>  The results of a public consultation, undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework, is currently being analysed and will inform both the Framework and the Early Years Strategy.   A further, focussed consultation with key stakeholders in relation to the Early Years Strategy, is also proposed.</p><p>  I have appointed an Expert Advisory  Group, chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy, Head of School of Psychology at UCD, to advise on the preparation of the Strategy.  The Group comprises external experts from a range of specialties, including paediatrics, early childhood care and education, child protection and public health nursing and is continuing to meet on a regular basis.  I have met the Expert Advisory Group on a number of occasions, most recently on  21 January 2013 and I am very satisfied with the progress made in developing Ireland's first Early Year's Strategy. </p></reply>

It is my intention to submit the draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government for approval as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Task Force on the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency reported in July of 2012. The work of the Task Force informed the development of detailed legislative proposals to Government, covering a range of areas including the function and services to be overseen by the Agency, governance structures and implementation arrangements. Arising out of these proposals, the Government approved the Heads of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill and has also agreed to the priority drafting of this Bill. The Agency, upon establishment, will encompass services which are currently the responsibility of three separate agencies; namely the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as soon as possible. Drafting of the Child and Family Support Agency Bill is at an advanced stage, in line with the policy decisions of Government. I anticipate that the legislation will be presented to the Oireachtas during the current term. A precise target date for the establishment of the new Agency will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.   </p><p>  While the legislative process is under way, all necessary organisational preparations are continuing in parallel. These preparations are being overseen by a high level group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and involving representatives of the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and the incoming management team of the new Agency.</p><p>  When established, the Agency will constitute one of the largest public agencies in the State with staff of over 4,000 employees. It represents one the largest and most ambitious areas of public sector reform currently underway.  I am confident that the establishment of the Agency will bring a dedicated focus to child protection, family support and other key children&rsquo;s services for the first time in the history of the State and will in time contribute to the transformation of what are essential services for families and communities.</p></reply>

It also provides that representation of citizens shall be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of six members per Member State, and that no Member State shall be allocated more than ninety-six seats.

Therefore the right of initiative in relation to this issue  rests with the European Parliament.  The Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament (AFCO) had its first consideration of a draft report on 22 January 2013.  AFCO will further consider the draft report over the coming weeks and a vote in the European Parliament is planned for the March plenary session.

The aim of the Semester is that EU-level discussions on fiscal policy, macroeconomic imbalances, financial sector issues, and growth-enhancing structural reforms will now always take place before governments draw up their draft budgets and submit them to national parliamentary debate in the second half of the year.  Additionally, the so-called "six-pack" of economic governance legislative measures came into effect in 2011 in order to enhance economic and budgetary coordination across the EU.  The position on the date of budgets raised by the Deputy is as set out in section 6.4 of the Budgetary Reform Chapter of the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement published last November.</p><p>  Another draft economic and budgetary regulation, part of the so-called &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo;, will introduce a common budgetary timeline for all euro area Member States.</p><p>  When this regulation is adopted and in force, all euro area Member States will be required to publish their draft budget for central government and the main parameters of all other General Government sub-sectors no later than 15 October each year with the final budget adopted or fixed upon annually by 31 December.  This means that much of our existing budgetary process, which is currently completed in the first week of December, will have to be finalised earlier in the year.</p><p>  Government will be considering the implications of these reforms in the coming months and once this requirement is in force, I can assure the Deputy that all necessary action will be taken to ensure that Ireland complies with the new requirements.</p></reply>

Following an independent valuation process, the Special Liquidators will sell the assets of IBRC (which are subject to a floating charge which secures IBRC debt to the Central Bank which will be sold to NAMA) to third parties at or above their independent valuation and failing that the Special Liquidators will sell the assets to NAMA at their valuation price.  The measure has the further advantage of achieving efficiencies by housing all legacy assets in one vehicle.

The Special Liquidator submitted preliminary DGS information to the Central Bank of Ireland on 12 February which estimates eligible deposits of &euro;123 million.  If the threshold for DGS qualification is mechanically applied (i.e. &euro;100,000 per person), the payment in respect of DGS-covered deposits would be just over &euro;30 million. However, the total DGS pay-out is likely to be significantly lower than this figure after the Special Liquidator excludes accounts such as:</p><p>- Accounts that have been legally pledged as security against other liabilities (in IBRC, NAMA or possibly other third parties),</p><p>- Accounts of Large Companies (only Small Companies, as defined in the Companies Act 1986, qualify for DGS pay-out).</p><p>  It will take some weeks before the final pay-out figure will be known.  The aim of the Central Bank is to pay compensation within 20 working days to depositors who have been duly verified as eligible.  The Central Bank of Ireland maintains a Deposit Protection Account which will be used to fund any Deposit Guarantee Scheme pay-out.  The current balance on this account is &euro;388 million and this is funded by credit institutions who contribute 0.2% of their total deposit.</p></reply>

As part of the explanatory information that was released by the Department of Finance in relation to the transaction last week, estimates were produced which showed an interest expense of &#8364;750 million for 2013, &#8364;875 million for 2014 and &#8364;950 million for 2015. A copy of this presentation is available on the Department of Finance website under the following link: <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>  It was also highlighted in this presentation that the interest costs shown were best estimates.</p></reply>

The net present value of the portfolio of bonds is &euro;25bn which is equal to the par value of the Promissory Notes that they have replaced.   With regard to the net present value gain in this arrangement, as the Deputy is aware, the calculation of a net present value is based on a number of mathematical assumptions, including what discount rate to apply and assumptions around future refinancing rates, all of which will depend upon the outcome of future events.  These assumptions can have a material impact on the ultimate valuation and it is subject to a wide range of possible outcomes. For that reason, the Department did not produce a net present value figure for publication last week and I am not in a position to give one now.  I can assure the Deputy that a key determinant of the value of the new arrangement was debt sustainability.</p></reply>

The following table provides a breakdown of the processing position of student grant applications received by SUSI on a county basis.  The data provided is at a point in time on the 13 February, 2013.  It gives the position for student grant applications for attendance at both further and higher education.  It includes data in relation to applications received from County Kerry.  This data has been provided to my Department by SUSI.  SUSI is continuing to make payments on a weekly basis to ensure students can get paid their grant as expeditiously as possible, once they have been awarded a grant.  Those awarded a grant must supply bank account details and confirmation of registration must be received from the institution in order for the first instalment to be paid.</p><p>Some students have still not provided any of the necessary supporting documentation to enable their grant applications to be progressed to finality while others have provided some, but not all, of this documentation.  This is similar to the position in previous years.  SUSI is currently offering those students that still wish to proceed with their grant applications a final opportunity to submit the documentation that has been requested before SUSI close their applications.</p><p><pcenter><br /><b>SUSI Applications - Processing Position by County</b></pcenter><table><tr><th><b>County</b></th><th><div><b>Total applications

There are 24 Statements  of Learning which describe the core of learning at junior cycle. It is through  enjoyment, interest and being proactive that the young person will learn.</p><p>  In addition, there are 8 key skills in the Framework. The obvious ones are  literacy and numeracy but all 8 skills will be embedded in their learning  through subjects, the new short courses and other learning experiences. With  the skill of &quot;staying well&quot; it is expected that the young person will enhance  their confidence, be enabled to be co-operative and respecting of difference.</p><p>  The changes in assessment will also allow the student to gain evidence of  learning as they progress through junior cycle. Positive feedback from teachers  and, in fact, from parents will also ensure that the self-esteem, confidence  and motivation of the young person is maintained throughout the three years.  Through a commitment to the implementation of all aspects of the Framework, the  educational system will be able to deliver a junior cycle that places the needs  of the student at the core of learning and teaching and thereby improves the  quality of the learning experiences and outcomes of all students.  </p></reply>

The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner. He holds them in trust. The title which the Minister acquires under this Section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it. The State Property Act also includes, in Section 31, a power for the Minister to waive the interest acquired under Section 28 of the Act.  </p><p>  It is understood that the property which is the subject of the current question was held within a company which was struck off the Register of Companies in September, 1972 for failure to file annual returns with the Companies Office. The beneficial owner of the property applied to the Department of Finance for a waiver of the interest acquired by the Minister for Finance under the provisions of the State Property Act and that waiver, in respect of which the consideration was &pound;160, was completed in October, 1986, approximately 14 years after the dissolution of the company. The effect of the waiver, which was not a sale by the State, would have been to allow the beneficial owner to complete the process of assembling a satisfactory title. The waiver itself would have formed only a limited element in the establishment of that title and the transaction was a normal exercise of Departmental functions.  The price which the beneficial owner may have secured in a subsequent sale was not a matter for consideration in the context of the waiver.</p></reply>

While this regulation would have implications for the existing budget and Estimates arrangements in Ireland, it is not yet possible to say when political agreement will be reached between the Commission, European Parliament and Council of the EU.</p><p>  When this regulation is adopted and in force, all euro area Member States will be required to publish their draft budget for central government and the main parameters of all other General Government sub-sectors no later than 15 October each year.

As the two-pack has not yet been adopted, this requirement has not yet come into force but I can assure the Deputy that we will take the necessary actions to ensure that Ireland will comply with the new requirements once they have been agreed.</p><p>  As regards the implications for discussion by Oireachtas Committees of the Estimates prior to the Budget, my Department will continue to work with Oireachtas officials to ensure the &#8216;whole of year budgeting&#8217;, announced in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</i>, continues under any revised timetabling arrangements.  This reform is an important new dimension of accountability and enhances the role and the policy relevance of the Oireachtas, in particular with regard to the role of Committees in <i>ex ante</i> consideration of resource allocation priorities in each area.

These discussions are centred on the establishment of a sustainable system of information exchange with the insurance industry identifying flood alleviation schemes and works completed where the standard of protection afforded by these works can be verified.  The discussions have not dealt with any other aspect of household insurance nor have they addressed the matter of a State backed insurance system.  There are no plans to introduce any such system.</p><p>  A working group has been established between the OPW, the IIF and representatives of several insurance companies to progress the work in order that the insurance industry can be more fully informed as to the extent of OPW funded investment in flood protection measures and to ensure that investment is taken into account by the insurance industry in assessing flood risk for insurance purposes.

Implicitly, therefore, there were approximately 12,000 more people employed in the private sector in that period.  This conclusion is supported by the job creation figures of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for 2012.  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland client companies created more than 3,300 net new jobs, while IDA Ireland companies created over 6,500 net new jobs.  QNHS data also shows that there was a net increase of 2,000 jobs in tourism in Q3 2012 &ndash; a sector which does not overlap with IDA or Enterprise Ireland activity.</p><p>  While overall in the economy, there has been a trend towards a reduction in full-time employment and an increase in part-time employment, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland figures for 2012 relate to full-time jobs.  Although job losses continue to be experienced in declining sectors such as construction, the positive results from the enterprise development agencies in 2012 underscores the merits of the Government&rsquo;s focus on innovation and export-driven sectors under the Action Plan for Jobs to create employment.</p></reply>

The additional places are critical to the continued improvement of CE, as outlined in the CE Financial Review of Schemes undertaken by this Department in 2012.</p><p>  The allocation of places will be informed by the population of long-term unemployed persons in each area, the number of claimants on Jobseekers Allowance, One Parent Family Payment and people with a disability in receipt of welfare payments for 52 weeks or more.  </p><p>  Priority will be given to (a) schemes involved in community child care services, social and health care services and drug rehabilitation services that offer training and development opportunities and work experience to CE participants and (b) those schemes with a clear track record in the development and progression of participants towards employment.</p><p>  An allocation of 500 of the additional places is reserved for child care support.  </p><p>  The Department recognises that there has been a decline in participation of lone parents on CE due to recent budgetary changes.  Every effort is being made to encourage take-up of these places.  The Department, in collaboration with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, are in the process of improving the provision of training and work experience for CE participants who wish to pursue a career in child care.

Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.</p><p>  In general, only deaths which occur within the State can be registered.  However, Section 39 of the Act provides for the following exceptions:</p><p>  The death of an Irish citizen on board a foreign ship or a foreign aircraft travelling to or from a port, or an airport, as the case may be, in the State;</p><p>  The death of a person on board an Irish aircraft or an Irish ship;</p><p>  The death of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Permanent Defence Force or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such a member outside the State while the member is serving outside the State as such member.</p><p>  Usually, when an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable. This certificate, translated, if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State. </p><p>  Section 38 of the Act makes provision for the registration of a death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State in certain specific circumstances.  Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death, i.e. a death certificate. In other words, if the death could not be registered or if a death certificate could not be obtained, the death can be registered here.</p><p>  The number of Irish citizens who are domiciled in Ireland and who die abroad is relatively small in the context of total deaths occurring here in any given year.  My understanding is that the vast majority of these people were travelling abroad for leisure or business purposes.  I am aware that the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection has recommended amending the current legislation in order to enable deaths of Irish citizens who have died abroad to be registered here. </p><p>  Any broadening of the current provisions will require careful consideration. It will be appreciated that the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship is very large.  This would have implications both for the registration process itself and for the vital statistics relating to deaths which are derived from registered events.</p><p>  This issue is currently being considered in my Department along with a number of other proposed amendments to the Civil Registration Act (2004) and in this regard it is hoped that legislation will be introduced in 2013.</p></reply>

The scheme permits customers to travel for free on most CIE public transport services, LUAS and a range of services offered by up to 90 private operators in various parts of the country. </p><p>  Customers aged under 66 years must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department in order to qualify for a free travel pass.

The current costing applied to a gluten free diet is &euro;68.43 per week for adults and &euro;6.50 per week for children. </p><p>  The last study into the cost of specialised diets was carried out in 2007.  Accordingly when diet supplement payments for qualifying individuals are being calculated the social welfare rates for 2007 are used. </p><p>  For example, a single person under age 65 on maximum rate invalidity benefit would receive a weekly payment of &euro;4.66. This is calculated using the invalidity benefit rate of 2007 (&euro;191.30) divided by three (&euro;63.77) which is subtracted from the cost of the gluten free diet (&euro;68.43).  </p><p>  A single person on maximum rate of disability allowance would receive &euro;6.50 per week. This is calculated using the disability allowance rate of 2007 (&euro;185.80) divided by three (&euro;61.93) which is subtracted from the cost of the gluten free diet (&euro;68.43).   </p><p>  The Department is currently undertaking a review of the diet supplement scheme.</p></reply>

SPT will cease to be paid from 2014 which will standardise the payment of pension at age 66.   In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2012 and to 68 years from 2028.  </p><p>  The abolition of SPT removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.   There is no retirement condition attached to the SPC. </p><p>  In December 2012, there were just under 14,400 SPT recipients and 312,300 recipients of SPC.  Only 1,700 people, or 12% in all, were awarded SPT directly from employment while almost half were already in receipt of another social welfare payment.</p><p>  Currently, a person who retires from work on reaching age 65 and who does not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for SPT may apply for  another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.  With regard to employment, arrangements for retirement from work are usually the subject of contractual arrangements between the employer and the employee and, as such, are outside my remit.</p><p>  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. These reforms are essential to ensure its sustainability and to address the challenges of changing demographics such as increasing life expectancy.  There are no plans to change the date of implementation.</p></reply>

Of course, further improvement is needed.   In that regard, the Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012; there is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals; it is planned to recruit additional Medical Assessors in 2013 which will assist in reducing the time taken for appeals where a medical assessment is required.

There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The Government has provided over &euro;47 million for the scheme in 2013.  </p><p>  A review of the guidelines on exceptional needs payments was carried out by the Department by a working group made up of former community welfare service staff. One of the recommendations emanating from this review is to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, in relation to the payment of exceptional needs payments in respect of religious ceremonies, mainly Communions and Confirmations, and to ensure that the SWA scheme is responding to financial need and not occasion.</p><p>  For 2013, the Department has recommended that payment of the allowance specifically in respect of religious ceremonies will cease. Applications can continue to be made under the scheme for assistance with child clothing. This measure will ensure that the ENP scheme will continue to respond to specific need and not to the occasion. </p><p>  This recommendation does not affect the discretion available to officers administering the scheme in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise. Persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme should contact the local officials administering the scheme.</p></reply>

The purpose of this USO is to ensure that all citizens can access basic telecommunications services at fixed locations at reasonable prices.  The USO in the telecommunications market is provided for in both EU legislative acts, Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC and national legislation, the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and User&rsquo;s Rights) Regulations 2011 &ndash; S.I. No.337 of 2011.</p><p>  The current USO requires that at least one service provider is designated to provide telecommunications access at fixed locations, access to telephone directories, reasonable access to payphones and specific measures for people with disabilities all at reasonable access prices by regulating connection fees and line rental charges.</p><p>  The national legislation authorises the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) to designate one or more service providers to perform the USO.</p><p>  In June 2012 ComReg extended until June 2014, a universal service obligation addressed to Eircom, which among other things, requires that line rental for basic fixed line telephone services is available to end users at a standard price across the country.  There is therefore no line rental price differentiation between urban and rural areas and nor is there is any proposal to amend this obligation at this time.</p></reply>

I have no legal basis to seek to influence its commercial decisions on pricing.  Eircom is the designated provider of universal services in the telecommunications market.  In June 2012, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) extended until June 2014, the universal service obligation addressed to Eircom which, among other things, requires that line rental for basic fixed line telephone services is available to end users at a standard price across the country.  There are no proposals to amend this obligation.  Separately, ComReg published a decision (ref. no., 13/14) on its website last week, which allows Eircom greater flexibility in setting wholesale rates for bundled services offered to its competitors at telephone exchanges where there is already active competition among service providers and/or exchanges where next generation access services are available.  The retail price for basic fixed line telephone services is not altered as a consequence of the decision and remains at a standard price across the country in line with Eircom&rsquo;s universal service obligation.  This was an independent decision on bundled service which was reached by ComReg in accordance with its mandate.  I had no statutory function in the process.</p></reply>

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories: Category 1, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; Category 2, where a receiver has been appointed; Category 3, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and Category 4, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.  This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories 3 and 4 are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  In Budget 2013, the Government announced the introduction of a local property tax which will replace the annual household charge.  It was also decided that a waiver will apply in certain circumstances.  A prescribed list of unfinished estates, subject to certain criteria and identified as part of the National Housing Development Survey 2012, in respect of which the property tax for 2013 will be waived in accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012, will be prepared.  I anticipate that this list will be published shortly.</p></reply>

This provides for greater consistency of plans at regional, city/county and local level, including through the requirement for a core strategy to be incorporated into development plans to reinforce the practice of including evidence-based policy objectives in future development plans. These new provisions are being reflected and implemented in new development plans and in variations to existing plans, and planning authorities are ensuring that local area plans are consistent with the development plan thereafter. I am further strengthening transport planning in local development planning by a more formalised process of integration through the statutory planning guidelines for planning authorities. In this context, the forthcoming <i>Guidelines to Planning Authorities on Local Area Plans</i>, which I expect to publish shortly outline, will encourage, among the key policies and objectives for inclusion in local area plans, smarter travel patterns through more compact, less sprawling, and better structured urban areas. They will also promote more sustainable and healthier travel habits such as walking, cycling, and the use of public transport. </p><p>  I will, in addition, provide an update of the <i>Development Plan Guidelines</i> during the coming year, <i>inter alia</i>, further to strengthen the integration of transport planning and forward planning.</p></reply>

In making such orders the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  Where appropriate and practicable, the Court in making any order takes into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In considering whether to make an order under section 11, the court, further to section 11D (as inserted in the Act of 1964 by the Children Act 1997) must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. </p><p>  The Act of 1964 (again by way of amendments in the Children Act 1997) encourages parties to a dispute in relation to a child to agree on the custody or guardianship of or access to a child.  Prior to institution of proceedings the legal representatives of the parties must discuss with them the possibility of agreement.  The Court may adjourn any proceedings to assist agreement between the parties.</p><p>  I am presently engaged in the preparation of a Family Relationships and Children Bill.

Where there is a single national police force, the case for the setting up of a policing authority to act as a link between democratic institutions and the day to day responsibility for operational policing loses much of its force.  This additional layer would very seriously dilute democratic accountability and political responsibility, as well as the performance and effectiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself.  The relationship between the Garda Commissioner, the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas has developed over time. The accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the House, both directly and through the Minister for Justice and Equality, has been strengthened by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p><p>  The separate roles of both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner in relation to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided for under the provisions of the 2005 Act.  The Act also made the Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Force, and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts in that capacity.  In addition, the 2005 Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, which is empowered to carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct, as well as the Garda Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Force.  The accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has, through these measures, been significantly strengthened.  </p><p>  Another critical point overlooked by those who advocate a separate authority is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not only the police service in this jurisdiction, it is the security service and border control authority of the State.  To pass control of such matters to an unelected body beyond the executive and the legislature is untenable.  It is more appropriate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be accountable to the Government and to the Oireachtas - which are fully representative of, and dependent upon the support of the sovereign authority of the Irish people.</p><p>  I have no plans to introduce a Garda Authority and there is no such commitment in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

In addition, an additional payment of up to 20% may be paid, where justified, based on &ldquo;transaction costs&rdquo; which are the costs incurred by participants in engaging with the scheme. Traditionally, this additional payment has been paid under REPS.  </p><p>  Given the on-going difficulties in the public finances and budgetary constraints on my Department, I have had no option but to make difficult decisions in the allocation of the funding available to many competing demands. In finalising my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2012, I announced a 10% reduction in payments under REPS 4 from 2012 onwards. I decided that the reduction would be implemented by way of a cut to the transaction cost of participating farmers of from &euro;28.03 to &euro;5.60 on each hectare on which the a transaction cost was paid.</p><p>  The 2012 payment of the person named was adjusted accordingly. This resulted in a 2012 REPS 4 payment totalling &euro;5,211.52, which issued to the person named in January 2013. Because of the particular circumstances of the person named, this represents a 7.9% reduction when compared to the 2011 payment which totalled &euro;5,660.12. </p></reply>

I am aware of the farmers&rsquo; concerns in relation to the proposals. Detailed data on payments to CAP beneficiaries was published prior to November 2010 when the European Court of Justice found that aspects of the legislation were invalid having regard to an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy and protection of personal data. The new proposal aims to address the deficiencies identified in the Court&rsquo;s judgement. The European Commission&rsquo;s justification for the proposed measures is based on the need for greater transparency and public control over the use of European agricultural funds in order to protect the Union&rsquo;s financial interests. The proposal is being considered at the Council of Agricultural Ministers and any new arrangements that may be adopted will come into effect to coincide with the proposed reformed CAP regime. </p></reply>

Centralising administrative procedures would enable my Department to reduce the number of administrative staff it requires to support District Veterinary Office operations and, accordingly, the cost of providing its services. The administrative functions for Cork have been recently centralised in Cork city and the administrative functions in the Limerick DVO will shortly be transferred to Naas. It has also been decided to transfer the administrative functions out of the Tipperary regional office. The centralisation of administrative functions in other regional offices will be considered in light of the availability of opportunities to redeploy the staff concerned to support other critical public services.

In this regard, the Department has issued a Code of Practice to all recipients of funds which set out recommendations for good welfare practice to which all should adhere.  All recipients of funding involved in the re-homing of dogs must demonstrate that they are participating in a neutering programme in order to assist in controlling numbers of animals and avoid further cases of animal distress.  We also remind recipients of the importance of compliance with legislation regarding the control of dogs, namely the Control of Dogs Acts, 1986 and Control of Dogs (Amendment) Act, 1992.

This Act makes general provision for the control and eradication of disease, the categories of animals and classes of diseases to which the Act applies.  Section 20 of the Act empowers the Minister to make Ministerial Orders for specified purposes and the nature of offences that may be prosecuted.   The Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order, 1989 was made under powers conferred by several sections, including Section 20,   of the Act.  The Order provides for, inter alia, the prohibition of tuberculosis testing without Department permission, the type of test to be used, the tagging of reactors, the removal, movement, control and slaughter of reactors.  Similarly the Brucellosis in Cattle (General Provisions) Order, 1991 as amended was made under powers conferred by the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, including section 20, and contains similar provisions to the TB Order.</p><p>The information relating to the total number of animals removed as TB and Brucellosis reactors under the Act is not readily available.  However, with regard to bovine TB, the number of reactors removed in selected years since 1960 is set out in the following Table.  I am pleased to be able to say that the TB situation has been steadily improving over the past 10 years or so as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade. For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.5% in 2000 to 4.21% last year and reactor numbers in 2012 were, at 18,476, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s.  I am hopeful that the incidence of TB can be maintained at or below these levels.  Ireland is free of Brucellosis in sheep, pigs and cattle.</p><p><pcenter>TABLE 1.</pcenter></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors</b></div></th><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors</b></div></th><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors</b></div></th><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors</b></div></th><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>No. of Reactors</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div><b>1960</b></div></td><td><div>139,881</div></td><td><div><b>1984</b></div></td><td><div>31,715</div></td><td><div><b>1992</b></div></td><td><div>35,997</div></td><td><div><b>2000</b></div></td><td><div>39,847</div></td><td><div><b>2008</b></div></td><td><div>29,901</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>1965</b></div></td><td><div>23,378</div></td><td><div><b>1985</b></div></td><td><div>32,608</div></td><td><div><b>1993</b></div></td><td><div>30,359</div></td><td><div><b>2001</b></div></td><td><div>33,702</div></td><td><div><b>2009</b></div></td><td><div>23,786</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>1970</b></div></td><td><div>35,982</div></td><td><div><b>1986</b></div></td><td><div>28,179</div></td><td><div><b>1994</b></div></td><td><div>30,439</div></td><td><div><b>2002</b></div></td><td><div>28,930</div></td><td><div><b>2010</b></div></td><td><div>20,211</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>1975</b></div></td><td><div>21,339</div></td><td><div><b>1987</b></div></td><td><div>27,682</div></td><td><div><b>1995</b></div></td><td><div>33,180</div></td><td><div><b>2003</b></div></td><td><div>27,978</div></td><td><div><b>2011</b></div></td><td><div>18,531</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>1980</b></div></td><td><div>29,827</div></td><td><div><b>1988</b></div></td><td><div>29,994</div></td><td><div><b>1996</b></div></td><td><div>30,400</div></td><td><div><b>2004</b></div></td><td><div>22,967</div></td><td><div><b>2012</b></div></td><td><div>18,476</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>1981</b></div></td><td><div>31,542</div></td><td><div><b>1989</b></div></td><td><div>43,580</div></td><td><div><b>1997</b></div></td><td><div>28,647</div></td><td><div><b>2005</b></div></td><td><div>25,884</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>1982</b></div></td><td><div>30,013</div></td><td><div><b>1990</b></div></td><td><div>41,419</div></td><td><div><b>1998</b></div></td><td><div>44,498</div></td><td><div><b>2006</b></div></td><td><div>24,173</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>1983</b></div></td><td><div>30,330</div></td><td><div><b>1991</b></div></td><td><div>36,832</div></td><td><div><b>1999</b></div></td><td><div>44,903</div></td><td><div><b>2007</b></div></td><td><div>27,711</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

As stated in my reply to the Deputy on 22 January, the Central Statistics Office has recently published a Census of Agriculture for 2010, which shows the number of horses in the country returned at 106,020 of which 37,513 were thoroughbred horses and ponies. </p><p>  However, the most recent estimate of the number of horses in Ireland is provided by a report commissioned by Horse Sport Ireland and conducted by UCD on the economic contribution of the Sport Horse industry to the Irish economy.  This report estimated the total horse population in Ireland at approximately 180,000.  These figures were compiled using a number of sources, such as Central Statistics Office data, the records of approved horse registration organisations and surveys of a wide range of parties in the industry itself.</p><p>  EU legislation on the identification of equines, which was transposed into national legislation in 2011 via S.I. No. 357 of 2011, provides that (i) equine animals registered after July 2009 must be identified with a passport and a microchip and (ii) if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31st of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, it cannot be admitted to the food chain. This legislation was amended in September 2012 ( S.I. 371 of 2012) in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport. </p><p>  My Department of Agriculture is also developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from Passport Issuing Organisations to the Department. The database will be populated by information provided from the databases maintained by the Passport Issuing Organisations, by the Department from records obtained at slaughter plants and knackeries and by Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants. The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.</p></reply>

In either case, the importation of meat and meat products into Ireland is a function of supply and demand dynamics, both locally and generally, and is influenced by factors which are variable over time such as price relativities, currency exchange rates and consumer preferences.</p><p>The statistics show that Ireland is a major meat trader and also a significant beneficiary of free trade in food products, with total meat and livestock exports generating estimated earnings of almost &euro;3 billion in 2012.</p><p>Data on volume imports of various meats from 2008 to 2012 is presented hereunder.</p><p><b>Meat Imports &ndash; Tonnes (000&rsquo;s) cwe</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Category</th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012 (Jan. &#8211; Nov.)</div></th></tr><tr><td>Beef </td><td><div>33</div></td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>46</div></td><td><div>36</div></td></tr><tr><td>Pigmeat </td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>74</div></td><td><div>73</div></td><td><div>79</div></td><td><div>75</div></td></tr><tr><td>Poultrymeat</td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>75</div></td><td><div>80</div></td><td><div>86</div></td><td><div>91</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other Meat Products</td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Source: CSO</p><p><b>Beef</b></p><p>Around 36,000 tonnes of beef were imported into Ireland last year with over 28,000 tonnes (79%) came from UK; of which almost 26,000 tonnes (72%) was from Great Britain and over 2,700 tonnes (7+%) from Northern Ireland. The majority of these imports from the UK consisted of cow carcasses for further processing before being re-exported as primal joints. Brazil, Uruguay and the USA are the principal non-EU suppliers of beef into Ireland. Processors import beef from a range of countries in order to produce specific products for the export market at particular price points.</p><p>It is also worth pointing out that import figures are relatively small when compared to the quantity of beef exports. For example in 2012, Ireland exported over 412,000 tonnes of beef &ndash; virtually all of it to other EU member states &ndash; which was nearly 12 times as much as it imported.</p><p><b>Pigmeat</b></p><p>In 2012, almost 75,000 tonnes of pigmeat was imported into Ireland. Around 29,000 tonnes (38%) of imports came from the UK with 4 other member states &ndash; Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands &ndash; cumulatively accounting for some 39,000 tonnes (52%) of volume. Pigmeat imports are destined for secondary processors, wholesale and foodservice operators. Ireland has an import requirement for loin and leg primal because domestic consumers&rsquo; preference for loin (pork chops, bacon, rashers) and leg (cooked ham, gammons) differs from that in other European countries where more processed meats are preferred. The price differential between Irish and imported loins is approximately 20%. There is little difference in the price of indigenous versus imported legs but supply is an issue.</p><p><b>Poultrymeat</b></p><p>Ireland imports significant volumes of poultrymeat annually; namely broiler, turkey and duck.  Broiler meat in the form of chicken breast meat (frozen / chilled / cooked) comes principally from Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, Germany and also international markets such as Thailand and Brazil. The product is used for wholesale, foodservice and further manufacturing. Turkey breast meat and crowns are imported mainly from Italy and Germany for cooked meats manufacturing and for catering / foodservice outlets. Whole turkeys, imported from Italy for the Christmas period, are supplied through the wholesale and butcher sectors. Typical cost differentials for imported versus domestic chicken and turkey can amount to as much as 30%.</p><p><b>Sheepmeat</b></p><p>Of the 3,467 tonnes of sheepmeat imported into the Irish market last year, almost 3,300 tonnes (94%) came from the UK. Imports, which peaked during the February to June period, were mainly British hoggets destined for food manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, foodservice. Imports from non-EU countries, primarily frozen product from New Zealand, were negligible at 83 tonnes. At present, Irish lamb commands a strong position in the domestic retail sector. The use of the Bord Bia Quality logo on-pack is growing in popularity since its launch on lamb in 2008. According to Bord Bia retail store audits, the percentage of facings of lamb product with the Quality Mark has risen from 55% to 84% in the 2 years from December 2010.</p><p><b>Other Meat Products</b></p><p>Products in this miscellaneous category, which includes offal, are imported mainly from the UK (47%) and the Netherlands (23%).</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>Ireland is a small, open economy that is hugely dependant on international trade flows in products and services. The above data demonstrate the extent to which the beef and other meat industries are reliant on trade with our EU partners and, by extension, the importance of that trade to the national economy.</p></reply>

However, in view of the fact that they have broadly similar animal health standards in relation to equidae, Ireland, the United Kingdom and France have availed of a derogation in the Directive to permit trade in registered equidae, other than those going for slaughter, to move between these countries without the prior inspection and certification. This is known as the Tripartite Agreement (TPA) and it has been in existence for many years and commits members to notify each other of confirmed cases of listed diseases that would alter the equivalence status. Given the integrated, all-island nature of the equine industry in Ireland the TPA has   particular benefits for the equine sector here. Furthermore, the operation of the TPA is reviewed regularly by the signatory countries to ensure its effectiveness and deal with any strategic or operational matters of concern.  The records available to my Department would indicate that approximately 16,000 horses are moved from Ireland annually under this arrangement. These are in addition to the numbers set out in the table above.</p></reply>

In particular the animals are required to be properly identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  Equines issued with a passport after 1 July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian, which is recorded in the passport and creates a link between the passport and the animal. The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport and the information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption. Horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone, known in the industry as &lsquo;bute&rsquo;, are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect.</p><p>  My Department implements official controls in relation to horse identification at marts and other sales venues, in abattoirs under its supervision and at points of entry to the country. The Department has detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs under its supervision and has communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators. It has liaised with passport issuing agencies in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered. </p></reply>

In order for the public to have confidence in a youth justice system, it needs to be reasonably assured that it is effective in its policies and delivery.</p><p>  The focus for the forthcoming Youth Justice Action Plan will be to continue the downward trends in high volume crime and detention; becoming more adept in understanding and intervening in more serious crime offending patterns; and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions in addressing the behaviour and needs of these children. The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities. Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.</p><p>  Of course, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a range of supports to families and children which, although not directly related to juvenile offenders, seek to address many of the social and economic contributory factors. I hope to bring a seamless new approach to policy development and integrated service provision for children so that they have the best possible start to life. In order to design and develop effective policies and services that make a difference, then as a first step, we need to better understand our children: their lives, their experiences, their expectations.</p><p>  My Department's National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives  2011-2016 sets out a 5 year plan to guide and support the development and use of research and data on children&rsquo;s lives, for the purpose of improving understandings and creating an evidence base to support policy and practice. Several of the priority areas identified in the strategy relate to the experience of children and young people in contact or in danger of coming in contact with the justice system. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the commitment given at broader systemic and cultural level through the way we deliver services, in particular through the work of the new Child and Family Support Agency (CFSA) which will be established this year. At the heart of the new Agency will be a new Service Delivery Framework, which will differentiate between child welfare and protection cases, such that family and child welfare concerns can be responded to by new multi-agency, community-based models for early intervention and family support. The new Agency will represent the practical application of a new approach towards 'proportionate' service responses.</p></reply>

This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector. There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people.</p><p>  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth services. Youth work and non formal learning in its many programmes and activities; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, resilience,  motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills; the 21st century skills that are so important to equip young people for the challenges in today&rsquo;s world.</p><p>  There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the significance of youth work in promoting young people&rsquo;s development, health and wellbeing, enhancing their participation in education, training and employment and the potential youth work has, as part of wider strategies to respond to the challenges that arise, as a result of the current economic situation,  such as youth employment. My Department is working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills and Department of Social Protection in the context of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs to identify in what ways the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment.  As part of the programme of the EU Presidency of the Youth Council, I will hold an expert round table on the subject in on 21st June 2013.</p><p>  The role of research and consultations with youth sector interests and the young people themselves are central elements in my Department&rsquo;s approach to the formulation of the youth policy services that are responsive to young peoples needs.  My Department has commissioned a review of international best practice in the field of youth work to advance our understanding of the impact of youth services in the lives of children and young people. The study will inform a new Youth Policy Framework which is planned by my Department for later this year. The findings of the Growing Up In Ireland Study of my Department and other studies including EU studies have been significant in relation to providing information about children and young peoples experience of bullying and its impact on them. </p><p>  The Action Plan on Bullying - produced by cross-sectoral working group on which my Department and the youth services were represented,  contains a range of evidence based actions to support parents, young people, schools and community interests, in tackling this issue which can have a serious impact on young people. My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills on the implementation of the Action Plan  and is undertaking a series of initiatives  to raise awareness about the problem and the measures to be taken to tackle prejudice and promote a safer environment for our young people.  The Youth Clubs funded by my Department are an important outlet for children and young people in this context.  Their activities can help to build self esteem, increase confidence and strengthen friendships so that young people are better equipped to counter bullying behaviour.</p><p>  Consultations with young people themselves and their identification of needs for supports and facilities is a core feature of the National Play and Recreation policy. As a result of the policy many local authorities have developed world class play facilities. Youth cafes funded by my Department are a particular success responding directly to teenagers identified need for places to &lsquo;hang out&rsquo; and an alternative to pub and drug culture.  My Department estimates that there are between 75 and 100 youth cafes now in place around the country.  I will shortly be announcing details of the &euro;1.75m in capital funding that is available this year  for the further development of these and other facilities to respond to young people.</p><p>  My Department works closely with the youth sector organisations to address the needs of children and young people. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee is an important source of advice and guidance to my Department in  developing youth policy and initiatives.  The committee is composed of a chairperson and 32 members drawn equally from the voluntary and statutory sectors involved in the administration and provision of youth work programmes and services. This committee advises my Department on matters relating to the development and coordination of youth work policies, programmes and services.</p></reply>

The issue of depression in young people is a complex issue requiring inputs from a wide range of stake-holders including young people, parents, schools, the media, youth organisations and the Primary Care and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>  My Department supports the National Youth Health Programme in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  Its work programme is informed by the knowledge and experience of the partners involved and most particularly by the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE and by the National Youth Council of Ireland which is the representative body for some 50 youth organisations in Ireland.</p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training and support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes.  It is covered under the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack delivered to youth organisations.  The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway.  MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people,  looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.  Mindout adopts a universal mental health promotion approach which has strong links with the &ldquo;Support for all&rdquo; element of the recent guidelines on Mental Health Promotion for Schools published by the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.   </p><p>  The National Youth Health Programme also offers a Specialist Certificate in Youth Health Promotion.  This programme is accredited by NUI Galway and adopts a whole organisational approach to health promotion.  It focuses on a holistic model of an individual&rsquo;s health and mental health and reinforces youth work as a valuable setting for mental health promotion.  Actions needed to address this issue obviously extend beyond the remit of my Department. My Department is currently leading the preparation of the new Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework which will represent a whole-of-government approach to addressing issue affecting children and young people including their well being.</p></reply>

Youth unemployment is a particular concern because of the difficulties it poses for young people themselves, their personal development and for social inclusion. The Government has a range of measures in place to tackle youth unemployment and these include initiatives in respect of education, training, job search assistance/work experience and support for job creation.   </p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have sought to highlight and promote the potential of youth work as part of the continuum of youth employment supports and I welcome the growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people.  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout Ireland. Youth Work and non-formal learning, in its many programmes and activities can offer young people opportunities, including valuable volunteering opportunities, which can aide young people in acquiring new competences and skills and in turn enhance employability and job-readiness.</p><p>  This is particularly relevant in the case of young people who are otherwise marginalised from traditional services, such as those who are not in education, employment or training, the so called NEETs cohort. Existing youth work services already provide a significant level of engagement with this cohort and have the potential to provide a value-added not readily available from other activation programmes, through provision of outreach, intervention and bridging programmes focused on developing skill-sets and job-readiness.  Already a number of Irish youth services have begun piloting innovative community-based programmes focussed on supporting youth employment.</p><p>  My Department and I will continue to engage with the newly-established National Youth Work Advisory Committee and other Government Departments to explore how such initiatives can be supported as part of the Government&#8217;s overall activation programme. Minister Bruton is currently finalising the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and in that context my Department is working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the inclusion in the plan of appropriate actions relating to the contribution of the youth sector in supporting youth employment, including through a greater focus on promoting and supporting volunteering opportunities.</p><p>  In line with the Ireland&#8217;s overall EU Presidency priority theme of &#8216;Jobs, Stability &amp; Growth&#8217;, I have sought to prioritise youth employment during my Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers.  The Europe 2020 growth agenda emphasises the need to <i>&#8220;develop youth work as a resource to support youth employability&#8221;</i> while the current EU Strategy for Youth (2009) contains a key objective to <i>&quot;develop youth work as a resource to support youth employability&#8221;.</i></p><p>  With this is mind, Ireland&#8217;s Youth Presidency Programme includes a priority focus on maximising the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in particular with respect to supporting youth employability.  Work is underway on draft council conclusions which I hope will be agreed at the EU Council of Youth Ministers meeting in Brussels in May which I will chair. I also plan, as part of the Presidency programme, to host an expert round table event on quality youth work and its contribution to Europe 2020 and youth employment in June of this year.</p></reply>

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. </p><p><b><i>Child Welfare and Protection Referrals and Assessment</i></b></p><p>  Once a referral has been made to the HSE Children and Family Services all cases are managed through a standardised business process. All reports of concern for the safety or well-being of a child are handled initially by the Duty/Intake team for the purposes of assessment. All staff receiving such a referral are trained in the duty system and are obliged to treat seriously all child welfare and protection concerns whatever their source. Once a report has been made the screening stage deals with the information reported and preliminary enquiries are concerned with formulating an appropriate response. </p><p>  Once it is agreed by the Duty Team Leader that it is a correct referral the case is allocated immediately for an Initial Assessment. This is a time limited process to allow the gathering of sufficient information on the needs and risks within a case so that informed decisions and recommendations can be made and actions that will result in better outcomes for children are taken.  The duty team leader, together with members of the team, will categorise the information received under the following categories:</p><p> -  level 1 - child and family must be seen immediately</p><p> -  level 2 - child and family must be seem within 3 days</p><p> -  level 3 - child and family must be seem within 7 days</p><p>Comprehensive information on the extensive process is available on the HSE website under the Standardised Business Process documentation.</p><p><b><i>Children and Family Services Change Programme</i></b></p><p>  Currently, HSE Children and Family Services are engaged in a major programme of reform. A major element of the reform programme involves implementing consistent and timely child protection procedures in line with the revised Children First National Guidance<i>, </i>through a single, national, service delivery model, which is in development, and through the introduction of a National Child Care Information System (NCCIS).  The NCCIS will be the central system supporting Social Work services. As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service. Management information will be derived automatically from the case management system. The introduction of the NCCIS is a high priority and will help in the management of social work case management and will significantly improve the level, quality and accessibility of information in respect of Children and Family Services.</p><p><b><i>Resources</i></b></p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that <i>Children First </i>has operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999. Significant resources have been put in place to support the implementation of <i>Children First</i> and in the case of the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, <i>Children First</i> has formed an integral part of their existing operations and practices. The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of <i>Children First</i>   throughout the HSE, voluntary and community sector.  In addition to the existing structures in place to support <i>Children First</i> , significant additional resources have been provided to the HSE over the past few years to increase the number of social workers in the child welfare and protection area. The recruitment of these additional social workers was included in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan, as was the commitment to place Children First on a statutory basis.  </p><p><b><i>Children First Legislation</i></b></p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the  in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  Following receipt of the Committee&#8217;s report, my Department is currently, in preparation of the legislation, considering the recommendations along with the broad range of submissions made, including any need for additional reporting guidance.</p><p><b><i>New Child and Family Support Agency</i></b></p><p>  The commitment to establish a new Child and Family Support Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services. The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency. It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &#8364;590 million. The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team. </p><p>  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function.  The new Child and Family Support Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government.</p></reply>

Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low labour market participation and dependant on income support. The departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work. </p><p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a &lsquo;whole of Government approach&rsquo; to tackling poverty in the population. The Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular.</p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children&rsquo;s outcomes is my primary objective. The development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross departmental collaboration to secure this objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard. </p><p>  The Programme for Government committed to reviewing the homeless strategy, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013, and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness.  Work on the review is complete and I understand that my colleague the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning, Jan O Sullivan TD intends to issue a policy statement on homelessness in the near future.  That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  I further understand that she will use the opportunity to indicate what she expects from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating long-term homelessness.</p><p>  With regard to my own responsibility, my priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.  As announced in Budget 2013, the Government committed to an Area-based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative, for which &euro;2.5 million has been provided for in the 2013 Estimates.</p><p>  This initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which has supported projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale, co-funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies. These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour and are currently being evaluated by national and international experts. It is important that we mainstream the learning from these pilot projects so that proven and effective supports for children and families can be delivered right through the country, including through the range of services to be provided by the new Child &amp; Family Support Agency.</p><p>  The new initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  In line with this commitment, my Department in conjunction with a number of Departments, including the Office of the Tan&aacute;iste and the Departments of Social Protection, Environment, Community and Local Government, and Education and Skills will work in 2013 to expand the number of project sites from 3 to 6.  The new initiative will not simply be a continuation of the PEIP scheme but will instead seek to implement programmes which have already been evaluated and proven to work in improving outcomes for children and families at risk of disadvantage.  It is envisaged that this initiative will be co-funded by a philanthropic organisation and discussions are ongoing to this end.  It will not be possible in advance of the completion of these talks to know the final total funding levels including the co-funding component.</p></reply>

This matter is currently being progressed in my Department.  The Deputy will also be aware that the HSE has provided information on aftercare to my Department to guide the development of policy to underpin the strengthening of legislation for services in this important area.  The HSE responded to my Department at the end of November in relation to the key findings of the National Implementation Group and provided information on the current provision of aftercare, assessment of need, multi-agency working and the HSE policy regarding section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991, which provides that the HSE must take all reasonable steps to make suitable accommodation available to a child who is in need of accommodation.</p><p>  The response of the HSE provides an important update on the significant progress in developing aftercare supports, the development of greater consistency nationally and the challenges in making supports available to individual young people, including the need for multi-agency cooperation and the need to take account of the views of those leaving care who, ultimately as young adults must wish to avail of the aftercare arrangements being made available.  There have been improvements in the delivery of aftercare service and the issue is under ongoing active consideration by the National Implementation Group.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people.</p></reply>

Particular regard is had to the needs of young people between the ages of ten and 21 and to those who are socially or economically disadvantaged including early school-leavers, homeless young people and those who are unemployed or at risk of substance misuse.  In particular, the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides targeted supports to disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2) and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  Supports is also made available for all young people via the Youth Service Grant Scheme, Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, European Youth in Action Programme (administered by L&eacute;argas &ndash; The Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce &ndash; the President&rsquo;s Award.  These measures aim to provide positive developmental opportunities for young people, to enhance their personal and social competencies, increase social inclusion and social integration and improve school attendance and engagement with formal education.</p><p>  Funding of &euro;53.173 million has been provided to my Department for the provision of youth services in 2013 and my Department is currently finalising the allocations for organisations and projects in 2013.  In light of budgetary constraints, the emphasis in 2013 will be on supporting existing youth programmes and services for young people including those projects for young people with fewer opportunities.  The funding budget of &euro;53.173 million for 2013 includes &euro;1.75 million for a new capital funding programme for 2013 that will provide &euro;1.5 million for youth caf&eacute;s and youth projects and &euro;250,000 for the provision of play and recreation facilities.  Criteria for the new programmes are being developed at present and my Department will be announcing details regarding the application process for 2013 shortly.  My Department provides funding for a Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports youth work activities at a local level (&euro;1.035 million in 2012).  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through local Vocational Education Committees. The allocation for this scheme will be notified to the VECs over the coming month and applications for funding will be subsequently invited by the VECs from local groups in their areas.</p></reply>

I have emphasised to the Health Service Executive the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by NCHDs with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period i.e. by end 2014.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.  The HSE National Service Plan 2013 states that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce. e Executive is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan.  This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken in relation to EWTD compliance at hospital level.</p><p>  The HSE was asked by my Department in January to ensure that clear responsibility is placed with a hospital CEO and a senior manager and/or clinical lead for the achievement of specified improvements in compliance, such that the end 2014 target will be met.  The Minister may give directions in writing to the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) under the Health Acts.  However, the position is that HIQA wrote to the HSE on 24th January 2013 in relation to concerns that there may be risks to patients as a result of NCHDs working in excess of 48 hours per week.  In the circumstances outlined, and in particular the measures in train to address compliance with the Directive, I do not intend to intervene as the Deputy  suggests.</p></reply>

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007.  To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants.  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, to provide a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.</p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time.  The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, pass the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams.  Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July.  In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE estimates that this will be sufficient to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.</p></reply>

However, <i>A Vision for  Change</i> recommended that CAMHS should be provided for all up to the age of 18 years.  The implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i> is a work in progress and transitional arrangements apply as the current CAMHS service is expanded to facilitate the provision of services to 16 and 17 year olds.</p><p>  Last year, the HSE finalised &quot;<i>Access Protocols for 16 and 17 year olds to Mental Health Services</i>&quot; which came into effect from 1 January this year.  In an effort to ensure that children are treated in an age appropriate manner, the new protocol provides that from 1 January 2013, CAMHS will accept referrals of all new cases of children up to their 17th birthday, and from 1 January 2014 referrals will be accepted for all new cases up to age 18.</p><p>  The changes now being implemented nationally have been designed to improve overall the provision of services for the age groups raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

In other jurisdictions, they would typically work in remote and isolated areas where there may not be access to a dentist. They have a broad scope of practice which includes restorations, periodontal treatment, oral hygiene treatment and extractions of deciduous teeth. Such independent practice is not permitted under the terms of the Dentists Act 1985. Accordingly, the Dental Council has not created a scheme establishing dental therapists as a class of auxiliary dental worker.</p><p>  The Council created a Scheme in 2002 establishing orthodontic therapists as a class of auxiliary dental worker. They would typically work in orthodontic practices under the supervision of an orthodontist. To date there has been no registerable training programme approved in Ireland for orthodontic therapists. The Council has recently put in place a mechanism whereby dental nurses can undertake a UK qualification while doing their clinical training under the clinical supervision of Irish based orthodontists. There are currently 4 registered orthodontic therapists in Ireland and up to 10 others in training or undergoing adaptation placements.  A HSE review of orthodontic services is underway. The outcome of this review will give guidance as to what changes will be desirable to provide the best model of care delivery, given current resources and expected future demand for services.  It is anticipated that a report for consideration by the HSE and the Department of Health will be ready by the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2013.</p></reply>

Developments so far under the Programme include the opening of Rapid Access Clinics at four of these centre, including Beaumont, St James&rsquo;s, Galway and Limerick. The Rapid Access clinics are led by Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs). Under the Programme, 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs) have been recruited to lead these clinics so that a total of 12 ANPs are now in place across the four centres, delivering services on site and on an outreach basis.</p><p>  The two Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs) planned for Cork and Beaumont under the Programme will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity. Monitoring is required for those patients with the worst effects of epilepsy, and patients at these units will require 24/7 care. </p><p>  The staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified. In regard to the planned EMU at Beaumont, I am advised that Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are working jointly to fill the posts necessary to support the service development. The recruitment of the necessary nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit, commencing Quarter 1, as nursing staff come into post. With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that the Service Plan for 2013 for CUH is being drawn up currently and will be finalised in the coming weeks, and that the provision of additional staff for the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit is being considered as part of that process.</p></reply>

In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group: has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group; is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group. </p><p>  In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where: there is a difference in bioavailability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them; and any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.</p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputy. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.</p></reply>

The Unit&rsquo;s purpose is to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  Since it was established last year, it has been working to unblock public access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system and by streamlining public hospital waiting lists, I am pleased to be able to say that very significant progress has been made by the SDU in relation to both emergency departments and waiting lists.</p><p>  Scheduled care &ndash; in-patient and daycase.  The initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  By the end of December 2012, the number of adults having to wait more than 9 months for inpatient and day case surgery  was down to 86 from 3,706 in December 2011, a 98% decrease.  The number of children waiting over 20 weeks for inpatient or daycase surgery was down to 89 from 1,759 in December 2011, a 95% decrease.  The number of patients waiting over 13 weeks for a routine endoscopy procedure went down from 4,590 in December 2011 to 36 at the end of December 2012, a 99% decrease.</p><p>  Outpatient services.  Improving access to outpatient services is also a priority for the Government and for the SDU Scheduled Care Team.  Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. For the first time, clear and comprehensive data is available on www.ptr.ie.  The data now being collected will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.</p><p>  In the coming months, as winter pressures in Emergency Departments ease, the SDU will work towards re-balancing scheduled care to maintain the improvements seen in 2012 and to achieve the new 2013 target that no adult should be waiting &gt; 8 months for in patient and day case surgery. </p><p>  These significant improvements in access and experience are being achieved despite the economic and budgetary pressures which must be dealt with and managed.  They reflect my commitment, and that of this Government, to ensuring patients can access the acute hospital services they need, when they need them</p><p>   The HSE publishes monthly performance reports on their website.  These reports include information on impatient and daycase waiting lists for adults and children, broken down by hospital and region.  The monthly performance reports can be accessed via this link:  </p><p>  </p><p>  The latest report available is for December 2012.</p><p>  In relation to your request for data detailing the numbers of patients waiting for elective procedures over the last three years, I have forwarded your question to the HSE who will respond to you directly in this regard.</p></reply>

This includes the migration of a significant part of the existing clinical services (including a new Emergency Department and Acute Medical Unit) to a new building, the implementation of the national clinical care programmes and other internal reforms that will enable the hospital to meet existing challenges in terms of changing medical practice and lay the foundations for a sustainable future. Many of these changes have regional significance and are reflective of a change in the wider health economy. </p><p>  I understand that the Executive management team in MMUH have been working with all relevant stakeholders in the region (hospitals, GPs, Gardai, Ambulance service ) to ensure a robust plan is in place to give effect to the Emergency Department move which is now scheduled to take place next Sunday, 17th February 2013.A move of this magnitude of necessity involves careful and prudent planning to minimise disruption. The Special Delivery Unithas been working closely with MMUH and the region (which includes the network of hospitals) to give effect to the transition to the new Emergency Department.   These changes will allow for a much enhanced infrastructure to support the delivery of more efficient and effective care for patients presenting at the hospital . </p></reply>
