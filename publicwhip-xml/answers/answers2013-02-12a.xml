Accordingly, it was necessary to adjust the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. However, rather than simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely: ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities; maintaining the countryside; and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.</p><p>  I was also determined that those adversely affected by the 2012 changes should be afforded the opportunity to appeal, where they could show legitimate reasons for their inability to meet the new requirements. In total, my Department wrote to in excess of 10,000 beneficiaries under the 2011 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme whose holdings had not achieved the minimum stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare, as required under the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme. </p><p>  Provision was made for an appeals process to take account of a variety of situations, specifically: Restriction on the stocking levels on the holding due to adherence to an agri-environments plan such as REPS, AEOS or National Parks and Wildlife Service plan; Farming marginal land where the level of stock that can be maintained is restricted; Illness or death in family; Outbreak of animal disease in the herd; New entrant to farming.</p><p>  In response, my Department received 9,635 applications from farmers seeking derogation from the requirement that the minimum stocking density on the holding should be 0.3 livestock units per hectare or higher in respect of 2011. </p><p>  These applications have been fully processed, with 7,086 being successful. Those, whose applications were unsuccessful, were informed of their right of appeal to the independently chaired DAS Appeals Committee. Appeals were received from 1,459 applicants, of which my Department was in a position to overturn the original decision on 547 cases, without the need to refer to the DAS Appeals Committee, on the basis of additional information which had not previously been submitted. </p><p>  Of the 849 appeals submitted to date to the Committee, decisions have been taken in respect of 599 cases, of which 192 were allowed, 351 disallowed and 56 requested to submit additional information. Processing of the outstanding appeals remains ongoing. </p></reply>

EU law provides for the free movement of goods between Member States. On that basis, meat and meat products, such as horsemeat, produced in an approved establishment, can be moved freely within the EU. Responsibility for compliance with EU food safety and traceability requirements rests in the first instance with food business operators (FBOs). FBOs must have a system in place to identify the source of inputs and destination of outputs (commonly referred to as &ldquo;one step forward and one step back&rdquo;).</p><p>  The regulatory requirements are designed to ensure that meat produced in approved slaughter plants is suitable for human consumption. The same legislation applies across the EU and the same controls will apply if horsemeat is imported back into Ireland.</p><p>  All equines (which include horses, ponies and donkeys) are required to be identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport. The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines. The information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption. </p><p>  My Department has detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs under its supervision and has communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators. It has liaised with passport issuing agencies in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered. Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is the policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.</p><p>  An annual audit of meat products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials.</p></reply>

This Scheme was fully funded by the Exchequer.  In the context of Budget 2013, I announced that, given the existing Scheme had reached the end of its projected life and achieved its aim, I had secured funding for a new support programme for suckler beef farmers to participate in a Beef Data Programme.  A total of &euro;10 million has been allocated for this programme in 2013, which is financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds.</p><p>  This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers.  In terms of support for the beef sector, I also announced that the Beef Technology Adoption Programme would be retained for 2013.  This Programme, which provides for funding of &euro;5m this year, will continue to provide farmers with better information to increase profitability on farms.</p><p>  In excess of &euro;150 million has been paid to participants in the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme since its inception. Payments amounting to &euro;30 million were made during 2011 and a further &euro;27.4 million during 2012. I have also made funding of &euro;10 million available in 2013 to continue to make payments for animals, born before 31 December 2012, that become eligible during 2013.</p><p>  My Department believes that this provision will be sufficient to cover outstanding liabilities under the Scheme, given that payment has already been made, where possible, on animals born between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2011.  As regards those animals born in 2012, it will be some time yet before the final picture emerges given the need to establish that the qualifying criteria have been complied with, particularly the weaning requirement.</p><p>  In total, therefore, taking account of the other initiatives to which I have referred, a total of &euro;25 million has been earmarked to support the beef sector in 2013.  I believe that this represents a significant achievement in the current challenging budgetary situation and reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector.  As regards 2014, it is too early to comment meaningfully in any specific terms, and I will review the matter in light of the budgetary situation and competing demands as preparation for the 2014 budgetary cycle commences.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-12a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021200053#WRB00700"><p>The most recent estimate of the number of Sport Horses in Ireland is provided by a report commissioned by Horse Sport Ireland and conducted by UCD on the Economic contribution of the Sport Horse industry to the Irish economy.  The report was published last autumn and estimated the total sport horse population in Ireland at 124,368.  Of these, the Breeding sector comprised 73,349, the competition sector 10,354 and the leisure sector 35,882.  These figures were compiled using a number of sources, such as Central Statistics Office data, the records of approved horse registration organisations and surveys of a wide range of parties in the industry itself.</p><p>  With regard to animal health issues, the movement of equidae between Member States of the EU is subject to harmonised rules governing animal health. These rules require all equidae to be accompanied by a passport and a health document stating that the equidae has come from a holding which is not restricted due to notifiable diseases of equidae and are clinically healthy at the time of examination. The rules also provide that the equidae must undergo a veterinary inspection 48 hours prior to movement and their movement must be recorded on the TRACES system.</p><p>  A Tripartite Agreement (TPA) between the United Kingdom, France and Ireland avails of a derogation provided for in Article 6 of Council Directive 2009/156/EC.  This allows Member States to grant one another derogations from requirements for inspection and certification prior to movement and trade between them, provided they are satisfied that the relevant health status between the signatory countries is equivalent. Each country is required to notify the other members of the Tripartite of any confirmed cases of listed diseases that change the equivalence status. The original TPA related exclusively to horses registered in stud books or registered to any international association or organisation which manages horses for competition or racing. However, with the advent of compulsory identification of equidae and the requirement for all equidae to have passports, all equidae with passports (except those destined directly for slaughter) are permitted to move freely within the TPA areas.</p><p>  With regard to human health, under EU and national regulation, only those horses that have been identified and registered with a passport issuing organisation may be considered for slaughter for human consumption.  Horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect at the time of the prescription being issued or the medicine being administered. An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport compliant with current veterinary requirements - this requirement is an essential part of the food-chain information required by food law.</p><p>  My Department introduced enhanced procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs in October 2011 and communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators. These procedures provide that an official veterinarian must be present in a meat plant when slaughtering is taking place. All animals are subject to an ante-mortem inspection, which includes an identification check, by an official veterinarian prior to slaughter. Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.</p></reply>

This was subsequently allocated at axis level under the programme financial plan. Since the launch of the RDP expenditure under the programme up to the end 2012 amounted to &euro;3.74bn.<b> </b>This represents close on 77.6% of the total value of the Programme which is &euro;4.82bn and 83% of the EAFRD amount.  Axes 1 and 2 of the Rural Development Programme are administered by my Department while Axes 3 and 4 are delivered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Details of the expenditure per measure under the RDP up to the end of 2012 and the amount re-imbursed by the EU are set out in the table below. This table does not include funds already committed but not as yet claimed.</p><p>The programme, like all national spending, is subject to ongoing budgetary constraints but is configured to maximise all available EU funding. Ireland&rsquo;s draw down rate under the Programme has been among the highest of EU Member States over the lifetime of the current Programme.</p><p>Spending under a number of measures may continue until the end of 2015 and this will provide considerable scope to allow all measures to spend up to their full allocation. Adjustments have already been made to the RDP financial plan and will continue to be made to the end of the Programme in order to achieve the fullest possible draw down of available funds.</p><p><table><tr><th> Support <br />Measure</th><th><div>Title</div></th><th><div>EAFRD Allocation per Axis</div></th><th><div>Total Expenditure <br />2007 &#8211; 2012<br />&#8364;</div></th><th><div>Of which EAFRD <br />&#8364;</div></th></tr><tr><td>Axis 1 Competitiveness</td><td>-</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>Vocational Training</td><td></td><td><div>7,133,733</div></td><td><div>4,040,626</div></td></tr><tr><td>112 </td><td>Setting up Young Farmers</td><td></td><td><div>12,892,430</div></td><td><div>6,504,938</div></td></tr><tr><td>113 </td><td>Early Retirement Scheme</td><td></td><td><div>212,653,617</div></td><td><div>112,687,662</div></td></tr><tr><td>121 </td><td>Modernisation of Agricultural Holdings</td><td></td><td><div>78,194,859</div></td><td><div>45,671,306</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total Axis 1</td><td><div>237,515,376</div></td><td><div>310,874,639</div></td><td><div>168,904,532</div></td></tr><tr><td>Axis 2-  Environment and Land Management</td><td>-</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>212 </td><td>Less Favoured Areas</td><td></td><td><div>1,288,821,995</div></td><td><div>708,852,098</div></td></tr><tr><td>213 </td><td>Natura</td><td></td><td><div>84,365,076</div></td><td><div>47,134,930</div></td></tr><tr><td>214 </td><td>Agri Environmental Payments</td><td></td><td><div>1,898,093,784</div></td><td><div>1,057,028,093</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total Axis 2</td><td><div>2,001,176,888</div></td><td><div>3,271,280,855</div></td><td><div>1,813,015,121</div></td></tr><tr><td>Axes 3 &amp; 4 &#8211; Wider rural economy</td><td>-</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>321</td><td>Rural Broadband Scheme</td><td><div>13,413,000</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>413 &amp; 421 &amp; 431</td><td>LEADER</td><td><div>239,435,326</div></td><td><div>162,083,165</div></td><td><div>105,057,499</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total  Axes 3 &amp; 4</td><td><div>252,848,326</div></td><td><div>162,083,165</div></td><td><div>105,057,499</div></td></tr><tr><td>511</td><td>Technical Assistance</td><td><div>3,000,000</div></td><td><div>1,441,575.23</div></td><td><div>720,789</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GRAND TOTAL</td><td><div>2,494,540,590</div></td><td><div>3,745,680,238 </div></td><td><div>2,087,697,941</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Since my appointment I have given the highest priority to the processing and payment of all scheme payments and to the elimination of all unnecessary delays.</p><p>  In a ten week period from late September to early December 2012, the amount paid by my Department by way of direct payments to farmers was in excess of &euro;1.4 billion.  By any measure, this is both a very significant sum in itself and a very commendable achievement in terms of delivery.</p><p>  To date, over 123,000 farmers have been paid in excess of &euro;1,210 million under the 2012 Single Payment Scheme. Payment commenced on 16th October 2012. The normal payment date is 1st December but the earlier payment date was approved by the EU  following my making a case to  the EU Commission.</p><p>  With regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, while there is no regulatory start date for payments, the scheme being co-funded, the recognised earliest possible payment date is during the third week of September; I can confirm that payments began on schedule on 26 September. To date, payments worth in excess of &euro;204 million have issued to some 93,000 applicants.</p><p>  Under the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment cannot commence prior to 1 December.  I can confirm that these payments commenced on 10 December last and, to date, payments worth some &euro;18 million have issued to 28,152 applicants.  The budget for the scheme is  &euro;18 million.</p><p>  Payments under the Beef Technology Adoption Programme commenced on target in late December, with some &euro;4.4 million already paid to in excess of 4,800 participants, while payments under the Dairy Efficiency Programme, worth in the region of &euro;5.5 million, are on target to issue in the coming weeks, to some 5,500 participants.  Payments worth up to &euro;1 million are also on schedule to shortly issue to those successfully participating in the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme.</p><p>  Area-based schemes under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13, are subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including cross checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, to be completed before payments can issue.  These rigorous procedures, together with on-farm inspections, apply to a number of scheme payments including the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS), and are necessary to ensure that applications meet the scheme conditions and cross-compliance requirements.</p><p>  Payments under the agri-environment schemes, REPS and AEOS in 2012 exceeded the levels of payments achieved in 2011.  Already in 2013 significant progress has been made issuing further payments and every effort is being made to resolve outstanding queries and to bring payments fully up-to-date.</p><p>  Under REPS 4  all payments due in respect of the scheme years prior to 2012 have been made and a total of 26,145 of the 30,000 applicants have been already been paid their 2012 payment.</p><p>  Under AEOS I  all outstanding payments due in respect of both 2010 and 2011 have been finalised and of the 7,500 participants remaining in that scheme over 6,200 have received payment in respect of 2012.</p><p>  Under AEOS II 5,070 of the 6,250 approved applicants have been paid in respect of 2011.  2012 represents the first full year payment for AEOS 2 applicants.  The high level of queries and farmer delays in submitting valid claims has resulted in a lower than expected level of 2012 payments under AEOS 2.  Nearly 2,100 have received payment at this stage and to deal with outstanding queries additional resources have been directed to this area with the intention of clearing the backlog as soon as possible.  Requests and reminders have issued to farmers that have not submitted valid claim forms and where applicants have received correspondence in this regard they should respond as soon as possible. </p><p>  Grant payments under Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) are also subject to eligibility checks including on farm inspections in order to assess eligibility and payments are dependent on the completion of the project concerned.</p></reply>

These reductions and caps are net of the greening payment and salary costs and would not have any practical implications for Ireland.  The Commission proposal does not provide flexibility for Member States to set individual national limits.  However, in agreeing the EU multiannual financial framework for the next EU budget last week, the European Council decided to make capping optional for Member States.</p><p>  Of course, this does not automatically give Member States the option to fix ceilings on individual payments at a national level.  This is an issue that EU Agriculture Ministers will have to consider over the course of the coming weeks in the light of the MFF agreement and the clarity provided concerning the overall budget for EU direct payments and national allocations.</p><p>  For my own part, I have stated before in this house that I would have no difficulty with a cap on payments of approximately &euro;100,000.  However, and particularly in view of our role as Presidency, I recognise that we must find a common solution across the European Union which all Member States can accept and live with. I also need to ensure that the flexibility countries are given in relation to the capping issue suits Ireland.</p><p>  I will be consulting with colleagues in the Council, Commission and European Parliament over the coming weeks with a view to arriving at a formula that is acceptable to the Commission and all Member States, including Ireland.</p></reply>

This process includes the following steps:</p><p> -  a detailed data collection in 91 Bays/Estuaries</p><p> -  a detailed analysis of raw data collected</p><p> -  setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site</p><p> -  carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application/fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and</p><p> -  determination of Licences/Fisheries on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors.</p><p>  The data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.</p><p>  While the Appropriate Assessments are carried out on a bay by bay basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually.  Factors to be considered include location within the bay, species, scale etc.  In addition to the Natura requirements, under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive all licence applications must undergo an Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment. This requires significant input from the Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors. All applications, in compliance with the requirements of the Aarhus Directive, are advertised in order to facilitate public consultation, and submissions or observations received must be considered as part of the licence application determination process.</p><p>  Conservation objectives had been set in relation to a significant number of bays and Appropriate Assessments have been carried in three bays (Castlemaine, Dundalk and Roaringwater).  I expect to be in a position to make licensing determinations in relation to aquaculture applications in Castlemaine shortly.</p><p>  My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of aquaculture licence applications having regard to the need to comply with all relevant national and EU legislation.</p></reply>

This essentially involves an adjustment to the original Commission proposal on external convergence - which itself was suggested by Ireland - in order to accommodate new Member States.

Properties located in the Fishery Harbour Centres are, when appropriate, offered for tenancy under lease or licence agreements.  An individual agreement, which is a formal legally binding document on both parties, is voluntarily signed at the outset by the tenant.  My Department currently has in the region of 140 property agreements in place in the six Fishery Harbour Centres.</p><p>  Property agreements are complex instruments and the specific terms of those agreements held with my Department vary.  Of the total in place approximately 80 property agreements do not contain rent review clauses which require rent to be static or increased in the subsequent period. These include short-term licence agreements and pending lease agreements.</p><p>  Any property agreements entered into subsequent to the application of Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 contain rent review clauses in which the rent payable following the review may be fixed at an amount which is less than, greater than or the same as the amount of rent payable immediately prior to the date on which the rent falls to be reviewed.</p><p>  In the region of 60 lease agreements contain rent review clauses which require static or increased rent to be applied for the subsequent period. All 60 of the property agreements that contain such rent review clauses were signed prior to the application of Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, 2009. These agreements generally require rent reviews to be conducted every five years.</p><p>  The most recent round of rent reviews on these agreements related to the period up to mid 2008. A number of the rental valuations determined by the qualified valuer, appointed by the Department following a tender competition, were disputed by the tenants. The rent review dispute procedures set out in the tenants' leases were followed and in some cases the independent experts recommended a decrease in the revised valuation determined by the valuer acting on behalf of the Department.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the economic situation facing businesses and small enterprises and following the completion of rent reviews due for the period up to mid 2008 I decided in 2011 that no rent reviews would be carried out for years subsequent to 2008 and that zero rent increases would be applied across the board. I have recently decided to continue this approach in relation to rent reviews due in 2013 and a zero rent increase will be applied in all such cases.</p></reply>

The proposed ceilings are 5% in respect of Member States such as Ireland who are fully decoupled and 10% in respect of others.</p><p>  I have long held the view that, as this is a discretionary measure, it seems quite inequitable to allow one Member State more discretion than another.

The Council also added language to allow Member States the option to exclude certain enterprises such as operators of airports, railway companies, waterworks, real estate companies, sport and recreational grounds, hunting estates, fishing and aquaculture estates, camping sites, or other like non-agricultural businesses or activities.</p><p>  The approach of the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament is to leave the definition to the discretion of Member States but to base it on farming activity.  The Committee also proposes optional exclusions for non-agricultural businesses or enterprises.</p><p>  My own view is that the most sensible approach is to base the definition on farming activity and to allow Member States the flexibility to exclude the so-called &ldquo;sofa-farmers&rdquo; while ensuring that those farming low productivity marginal land remain eligible for payment.</p><p>  The position of the Council is clear at this point.

These figures were consistent with the annual funding provided in each year for the afforestation programme.</p><p>  The outlook for planting in 2013 is positive with an increased interest in forestry among landowners as evidenced by the increased number of applications approved over the past year, much of which will feed into the planting programme for 2013.  The provision of funding for the forestry programme in the 2013 Budget at more than &euro;112.5 million will allow for approximately 7,000 hectares of new planting which should accommodate current demand.  Provision was also made in the Budget for the continuation of the forestry support schemes, primarily the Forest Roads Scheme.</p><p>My Department undertakes significant promotional activities, with the assistance of Teagasc, to encourage increased farmer participation in forestry, highlighting the economic, social and environmental benefits of forestry. Teagasc is currently holding a series of one-to-one clinics throughout the country, offering free, independent advice to any landowner considering the possibility of planting. These promotional activities, together with the opportunities presented by the current timber prices and the developing wood energy sector, should all contribute to an increased interest in planting new forests.</p></reply>

Properties located in the Fishery Harbour Centres are, when appropriate, offered for tenancy under lease or licence agreements.  An individual agreement, which is a formal legally binding document on both parties, is voluntarily signed at the outset by the tenant.  My Department currently has in the region of 140 property agreements in place in the six Fishery Harbour Centres.</p><p>  Property agreements are complex instruments and the specific terms of those agreements held with my Department vary.  Of the total in place approximately 80 property agreements do not contain rent review clauses which require rent to be static or increased in the subsequent period. These include short-term licence agreements and pending lease agreements.</p><p>  Any property agreements entered into subsequent to the application of Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 contain rent review clauses in which the rent payable following the review may be fixed at an amount which is less than, greater than or the same as the amount of rent payable immediately prior to the date on which the rent falls to be reviewed.</p><p>  In the region of 60 lease agreements contain rent review clauses which require static or increased rent to be applied for the subsequent period. All 60 of the property agreements that contain such rent review clauses were signed prior to the application of Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, 2009. These agreements generally require rent reviews to be conducted every five years.</p><p>  The most recent round of rent reviews on these agreements related to the period up to mid 2008. A number of the rental valuations determined by the qualified valuer, appointed by the Department following a tender competition, were disputed by the tenants. The rent review dispute procedures set out in the tenants&rsquo; leases were followed and in some cases the independent experts recommended a decrease in the revised valuation determined by the valuer acting on behalf of the Department.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the economic situation facing businesses and small enterprises and following the completion of rent reviews due for the period up to mid 2008 I decided in 2011 that no rent reviews would be carried out for years subsequent to 2008 and that zero rent increases would be applied across the board. I have recently decided to continue this approach in relation to rent reviews due in 2013 and a zero rent increase will be applied in all such cases.</p></reply>

These principles are that:</p><p> -  The CAP 2014-2020 must overall be simpler and cheaper for national authorities to administer, and have reduced administrative costs for recipients. Any increased cost or complexity to specific measures can only be justified where the benefits outweigh the costs,</p><p> -  A risk-based approach should be applied to all controls on both administrations and recipients. This means that controls are reduced where the administration has demonstrated that they have a robust system of controls in place, or the recipient has a good track record. Equally, controls should - as is already the case - be increased where systemic problems have occurred,</p><p> -  Member States should be given the discretion and flexibility in programming and to define the detailed control, monitoring and evaluation of schemes in a manner appropriate to their particular circumstances, providing they can demonstrate that the policy measures taken are effective,</p><p> -  Greater proportionality should be applied to controls and penalties,</p><p> -  Full transparency and clarity of all roles and responsibilities should be provided, and mechanisms put in place for providing the necessary clarity if there is any uncertainty about the interpretation of EU requirements,</p><p> -  The use of technology should be maximise and incentivised.</p><p>  Last year, we submitted a detailed paper to the Commission containing our proposals for simplification. The paper divided our concerns between policy and technical dimensions. The technical dimensions related to detailed article-by-article provisions of the draft CAP reform regulations.  On policy, we stated our view that the formulation of policy in an overall sense should be informed by the need to keep things as simple as possible, and we highlighted some key concerns in this regard, namely:</p><p> -  on direct payments, the fact that the proposals for a new payment model, the definition of &lsquo;active farmer&rsquo; and a separate scheme for the &lsquo;greening&rsquo; of direct payments would all add considerably to the administrative burden for Member States,</p><p> -  on rural development, the fact that a complex framework to ensure coherence between spending from all EU funds, new ex-ante and macroeconomic conditionalities, and a new performance reserve would, similarly, add to Member States&rsquo; administrative burden,</p><p> -  on financing and monitoring of the CAP, that there should be greater simplification of cross-compliance measures, the accreditation of payment agencies and the requirements for certifying bodies,</p><p> -  that the general simplification of the regulatory framework, which is best exemplified in the single CMO proposals, should also result in practical benefits at farmer and administrative levels across all elements of the reform.</p><p>  Many of our concerns have been taken on board in the subsequent negotiations, which, of course, are still ongoing. </p></reply>

I am, of course, aware that this proposal, as currently formulated, could create a number of problems both in the land rental market up to 2014 and in the establishment of entitlements.</p><p>  I would emphasise that this issue is by no means settled at this point.  The Commission announced recently that it was proposing to delay the implementation of certain aspects of the reform until 2015, and this will also have to be factored into the discussion on this point.</p><p>  On the specific question of whether the lessor or lessee will hold the entitlement, the entitlement would normally fall due to the lessor of the land in question, as it is he or she who has the capacity to declare the land, and, of course, there is the added condition that eligibility is conditional on having activated at least one entitlement in 2011.  However, as the proposal currently stands, there is provision for the conclusion of contracts to transfer entitlements on leased land to one or more farmers.  This will be a matter for the lessor and lessee to agree.</p><p>  I would again advise farmers that they should not rush into investment or long-term leasing decisions on the basis of the current proposals. Detailed clarification and further negotiation remains to be done in this area. My objective at all times will be to ensure that the system of entitlements that is finally agreed will be in the best interests of productive and active farmers.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;150 million has been paid to participants in the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme since its inception.</p><p>  In addition, I have allocated &euro;10 million in 2013, financed from unspent Single Farm Payment Funds for a new support programme for suckler beef farmers to participate in a new Beef Data Programme. This programme will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers.  By way of further support to the beef sector, I announced that the Beef Technology Adoption Programme will be retained in 2013. This Programme is built on the lessons of the Dairy Efficiency Programme and provides a &euro;5 million financial stimulus to encourage, through the medium of professionally facilitated discussion groups, and a task oriented approach, the adoption of a more focussed commercial approach to beef farming.</p><p>  In total, therefore, I have made provision for the payment aid amounting to &euro;25 million to the beef sector in 2013 which speaks for itself in terms of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector.  It is evident, therefore, that, in the context of the existing regime, considerable support has and continues to be made available for the sector.  With discussions ongoing at EU level on the shape of the future regime overall, it is too early to make specific comment in relation to any particular sector; however, I fully recognise its importance in the context of the ambitious targets set for the beef sector in coming years.</p></reply>

I am very pleased that we have managed to protect Irish farmers&rsquo; direct payments, given that there were substantial threats to this vital transfer to Ireland from those who wished to cut the CAP budget overall by a much larger amount and from the redistribution of these funds between member states.  </p><p>  On Rural Development, overall EU funding has been reduced from the previous financial period, and there has been some redistribution between Member States. However, we managed to negotiate a special additional allocation of &euro;100 million for Ireland in the final stages of the talks.  </p><p>  The challenge for us now is to ensure that this money, which will be matched with Irish exchequer funding, is used as effectively as possible to support the aims and targets we have set ourselves in Food Harvest 2020. The agri-food sector has tremendous potential for further sustainable growth and we must use these funds to maximise that potential and deliver the jobs dividend that will come from it.</p><p>  The policy paper produced by the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association relates more particularly to the reform of the CAP for the period post-2013. As President of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers, my objective is to negotiate a Council position on the reform package by the end of March, with a view to securing an inter-institutional political agreement with the European Parliament and the Commission by the end of June. Bearing this in mind, the position is broadly as follows:</p><p>  Two of the most difficult issues in the negotiations arise in relation to the administration of the single farm payment. These are internal convergence and greening. As regards internal convergence, the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to move to a system of flat-rate national or regional payments would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers. These Member States are seeking a solution that will mitigate this impact and this is an issue on which Ireland too played a leading role. Other Member States - such as the newer Member States who already implement an area-based system - are seeking alternative solutions, while still others are happy with the flat rate system. I hope to be able to navigate a course through these diverging positions in the coming weeks and settle on a compromise acceptable to all Member States. </p><p>  As regards greening, most Member States (including Ireland), support further greening of the CAP, as it is consistent with the need to develop the agriculture sector in a sustainable manner. However, there are concerns about the separate and distinct nature of the greening payment, and the fact that it is to be paid on a flat-rate basis. Member States also have issues with the three greening criteria (crop diversification, maintenance of permanent grassland and ecological focus areas) and favour flexibility to implement these in a simpler manner that is also more relevant to local conditions. Again, I hope to bring forward proposals on these issues in the coming weeks that will strike a balance between the different approaches favoured by Member States.</p><p>  On the other direct payments issues raised by the Deputy, the main point outstanding, according to the Cyprus Presidency&rsquo;s Progress Report, is the question of the young farmers&rsquo; scheme, and whether it will be voluntary or mandatory for Member States. I have stated my preference for a mandatory scheme, but I recognise that a majority of Member States favours a voluntary approach. </p><p>  On rural development, apart from the question of funding, the main issues in the context of the CAP reform package are the effect of the greening of direct payments on the baseline for rural development payments, the delimitation of areas with natural constraints and the structure of risk management and income stabilisation tools. In addition, the Commission is pressing for greater coherence between the different EU funds and to ensure that all objectives are consistent with EU 2020 strategy priorities, which raises administrative difficulties for Member States. Some of these issues will again prove difficult to resolve, but I hope to make rapid progress over the coming weeks.</p><p>  As regards the common organisation of the market, I agree that adequate funding is an important prerequisite for the effective functioning of the various elements of the safety net mechanism. Particularly difficult issues in this dossier will be control measures in the form of sugar quotas and vine planting rights. Member States are divided on the question of whether sugar quotas should be abolished or extended, although the European Parliament generally favours extension. On vine planting rights, the report of the High Level Group will inform the next phase of the discussions, but again the question will be whether to extend the regime or allow the planned expiry in 2015 to proceed. Compensation for reduced milk supply, as proposed by the European Parliament, will also be a difficult issue as it too touches on the organisation of the market, on which there are contrasting views. On producer organisations, some progress has been achieved, with the Special Agriculture Committee last week reaching agreement on the issue of recognition. On exceptional measures and the crisis reserve, the key requirement is that funding is available to deal with whatever emergency situations might arise.</p></reply>

However, my view is that it preferable to do so in a way that avoids adding excessive bureaucracy. </p><p>  I have concerns that the proposed structure of the greening payment, i.e. a flattening of 30% of the direct payment, would hasten the movement towards uniform national or regional payment rates. I want to see the 30% greening component calculated as a percentage of each individual farmer&rsquo;s payment as opposed to a flat 30% of the national average payment.</p><p>  As to the greening criteria proposed, Ireland&rsquo;s preferred option was to enhance current cross compliance and GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition) provisions by adding (adjusted) greening measures, but I now accept that this will not deliver the visibility sought by the Commission for its greening initiative. Nevertheless, I believe there are some practical difficulties that need to be resolved in terms of thresholds and percentages and that the three greening criteria proposed by the Commission need to undergo some adjustment.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding Ireland&rsquo;s national position, my task, over the coming period, will be to find common ground on these issues, first within the Council and then between the three EU institutions. To that end and in consultation with partners, I will be devising a series of compromises that I believe will be acceptable to the majority of Member States with a view to reaching agreement on this complex dossier.</p></reply>

This announcement was made against the background of ambitious plans under the Food Harvest 2020 Report to increase dairy production by 50% in the period to 2020, and the realisation that such additional production would need to find a home on international markets. </p><p>  Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important issue in the market place for multi-national dairy and food operators, many of which now have sustainability as a core part of their corporate strategies.  Ireland is well placed to develop a national brand image based on its mild maritime climate, plentiful supplies of water, grass based production, and an already positive green image.  </p><p>  Last year Bord Bia launched its &ldquo;Origin Green&rdquo; programme which establishes a framework within which Irish food companies can have their green credentials independently measured, and this will be a critically important element in the development of the Irish food sector in the coming years and its promotion on international markets.  Indeed it has become clear during my trade missions to China and the US in 2012 that the sustainability message has a strong resonance both with potential customers for Irish food products and with potential investors in the Irish agri food sector.  The key is to build independently verifiable metrics, which can be used in the marketplace, around Ireland&rsquo;s already positive green image.   Developing an independently accredited sustainability and quality programme for the dairy sector is an important part of that overall strategy.  There is also a strong correlation between the measures needed to improve environmental sustainability, and those needed to reduce the costs of production at farm level and improve profitability.  </p><p>  In that context, and following extensive consultations with stakeholders in the first half of 2012, I announced last June that Bord Bia would begin detailed work on the development of a national sustainability programme for the dairy sector, which will be used as a key element in marketing and promotional efforts on international markets.  Stakeholders are currently engaged in detailed technical discussions on the development of the programme, under the aegis of a technical advisory group convened by Bord Bia to progress the issue.  It is essential, of course, that the technical elements of such a programme strike the correct balance and are both practical to implement and meaningful in content.  I am confident that this programme, which will in any event be finalised in full consultation with stakeholders, including farm bodies, will strike an appropriate balance, and that it will facilitate the expansion and development of the Irish dairy sector.</p></reply>

The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement. This is done by a combination of inspection of establishments and by audit on the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>It is important to point out that the key controls carried out by my Department, under its contract with the FSAI, relate to food safety. </p><p>  EU law provides for the free movement of goods between Member States. On that basis, meat and meat products produced in an establishment which is approved under the relevant EU regulation can be moved freely within the EU. As is the case with compliance with EU food safety regulations, responsibility for compliance with traceability requirements rests in the first instance with food business operators. Food business operators in Ireland are responsible for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from EU approved plants. They must also have a system in place to identify the source of inputs and destination of outputs (referred to as one &#8220;step forward and one step back&#8221;). </p><p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at stand alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. Checks are also conducted at retail level by the HSE, working under the aegis of the FSAI which has an overarching supervisory role in relation to labelling matters.  </p><p>  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>  Under the Department&#8217;s National Residue Programme, and including tests on bovine samples carried out by processors, up to 30,000 samples taken at farm and factory level and covering a wide range of food stuffs are tested annually. These tests relate to microbiological and chemical standards, their primary focus being on food safety. These are fully in accordance with EU testing requirements.  </p><p>  In addition the Product Official Sampling and Testing (POST) programme is a microbiological testing programme on samples taken from Department approved ready-to-eat food, meat product, minced meat and meat preparation plants i.e. added value plants. This is part of the official verification of food safety controls in the plants concerned as provided for in Regulations (EC) 852/2004, 854/2004 and 2073/2005. A total of 1,600 samples are taken annually and the sampling and testing is risk based.</p><p>  The focus of the Department and FSAI efforts in relation to current investigations has been on identifying the source of equine DNA in beef burgers, and ensuring that the corrective action necessary to prevent a recurrence is taken. DNA testing is not required under EU legislation and is not generally in use in relation to food production. It has however been deployed in recent times as part of the FSAI&#8217;s checks on food authenticity and food fraud control programmes. In that respect it is another new layer to our food production controls. </p><p>  In the light of recent developments I have decided to request Irish manufacturers of processed meat products to carry out DNA testing and to work with the FSAI in developing testing protocols. I consider this a necessary step in order to provide further reassurance to Irish consumers and consumers of Irish food abroad about the authenticity of ingredients in our meat based products. Having regard to the close trading relationship between the Irish and UK food industries it is intended that the FSAI and the UK Food Standards Agency will work closely together and jointly agree an approach in this matter.   </p><p>  It is worth noting that it was because of the vigilance of our testing and control regime in Ireland that what is now a pan European problem, involving a range of meat products and traders/food business operators, was exposed. In that context I am raising the issue at EU level to consider the wider implications and whatever steps may be necessary at that level to comprehensively address this matter. That does not lessen the determination of my Department and FSAI to continue to work with the Gardai to bring the enquiries here to a conclusion. I will continue to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure this issue is addressed in a comprehensive and effective manner. </p></reply>

In order to facilitate the 2012 payment applicants must have submitted a valid claim form if they have selected a non-productive capital investment action.

The Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent. Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of this system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to more acceptable gains and losses to individual farmers than a flat rate system.</p><p>  I have examined the French proposal and I believe that it is worth including also as an option for Member States.  </p><p>  I would add that, as President of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers, my overriding objective is to negotiate a Council position on the reform package by the end of March, with a view to securing an inter-institutional political agreement with the European Parliament and the Commission by the end of June. In that regard, I will be making proposals on this key issue within the next few weeks.  I will be seeking reasonable flexibility for Member States on how these funds are distributed. I want to see payments distributed more fairly between farmers, but I want a sensible level and pace of change that will not disrupt our most active and efficient farmers as they gear up to meet the ambitions of our Food Harvest strategy.</p></reply>

The current legislative framework regulating forestry activities is as provided in the Forestry Act 1946 as amended. The current legislation specifically governing Coillte is the Forestry Act, 1988 as amended.</p><p>  The review of Coillte, to which the Deputy refers, was undertaken on foot of a commitment in the previous Government&rsquo;s Renewed Programme for Government.  While significant work was undertaken by an interdepartmental group dealing exclusively with the role, functions and operations of Coillte, the deliberations were superseded by the Government Decisions in 2012 in relation to the sale of state assets which encompasses Coillte.</p></reply>

Activities licensed by my Department must be subjected to screening for appropriate assessment and/or appropriate assessment before I may consent to such activities.</p><p>  Since the announcement of the proposed designations, my Department has been working with the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to identify fishing activities and aquaculture operations within the six sites, their interaction with designated features and potential impacts.  This work is continuing and my Department will be in discussions with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht to discuss these matters.  I will be doing all within my power to ensure the continuance of fishing and aquaculture within these sites, while ensuring the protection of designated habitats and species, in compliance with my obligations in law under S.I. 477 of 2011.</p><p>  Regulation 13 of S.I. 477 of 2011, and Annex III Stage 1 of the EU Habitats Directive, specify the circumstances in which a person affected by these proposed designations may object to the designation and the criteria on which any objection must be founded.

In terms of future emissions, a recent Teagasc study on the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture finds that, under Food Harvest 2020, and with the adoption of the cost beneficial measures alone, there would be virtually no change in emissions from the 2010 level, (4.5% below 2005 - EU Effort Sharing reference year).</p></reply>

I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.  </p><p>  I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased in the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand and has introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example, Teagasc has recently launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD). Teagasc has also developed recently a new Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. </p><p>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.</p><p>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief has been announced in the 2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes, once State Aid approval has been received, will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Restructuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land.  A recent EU Commission study found that <i>'younger [farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force'</i><sup> [[1]</sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas</i>, p. 25. Brussels, 12/10/2011.  </p><p>  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations.  Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.

In order to preserve the forest estate, my Department&rsquo;s long-standing policy is that replanting should take place following harvesting apart from exceptional circumstances.  The replanting obligation is one of the issues that have been identified in relation to the possible harvesting rights concession.  While the consideration process is at an advanced stage, no decision has been taken, as yet.</p><p>  In relation to the achievement of forestry targets, the Forest Service of my Department promotes afforestation, on an ongoing basis, as a viable land use for landowners through the provision of planting grants and payment of annual premiums.  A total of &euro;112 million in funding for capital and current expenditure was allocated for the overall forestry programme in 2013 to facilitate the payment for close to 7,000 hectares of new planting this year. </p></reply>

The tender attracted 11 bids.</p><p>  The winning company, Terminal 4 Solutions, which is an Irish company, was selected because it offered the best value for money when the quality of their proposed solution, its comprehensiveness, its technical merit as well as the quality of technical support, training and knowledge-transfer being offered were assessed against the proposed costs.</p><p>  In defining the scope of the project during 2011, consultations were held with then-recent Presidencies, Belgium and Hungary, to ascertain the nature and scale of Presidency websites, and the standard expected by users.</p><p>  From these and other discussions, it was agreed that the Irish Presidency website must be a high-performing site, able to meet clearly-defined specifications:</p><p>- secure, accessible and available at all times (eu2013.ie includes a full disaster recovery site to ensure business continuity) </p><p>- capable of handling high volumes of users (eu2013.ie has received over 150,000 visits and more than 540,000 page views since its launch in mid-December)  </p><p>- equipped to deal with resource-intensive material such as live-streaming of events and similar media-rich content (eu2013.ie live-streams coverage of high-level meetings in Dublin and in Brussels, as well as cultural and other events, and has hosted 54 videos and numerous images of events in the first weeks of the Presidency) </p><p>- constructed to achieve a high ranking with internet search engines</p><p>- available in multiple language versions (eu2013.ie exists in English, Irish, French and German versions).</p><p>  It was also determined that the site needed to be made available across a number of mobile platforms, with the capacity to track and monitor use.  It has also been integrated with Presidency-specific social media accounts (the Presidency twitter feed is embedded across the website and already has over 5700 followers). </p><p>  Negotiations with the selected supplier were centred on achieving this desired level of outcome at the lowest cost.  The contract was agreed on a fixed-price basis and any extra resources required have been the responsibility of the developer.  </p><p>  The time taken to research the requirements, the definition of the project scope, the open procurement and the fixed-price nature of the contract demonstrate that adequate steps have been taken to ensure that the website costs are reasonable and represent good value for money.</p></reply>

Article 14.2 of the Treaty on European Union sets an overall ceiling of 750 seats, plus the President, for the European Parliament.  It also provides that representation of citizens shall be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of six members per Member State, and that no Member State shall be allocated more than ninety-six seats.</p><p>  There is a need therefore to adjust the distribution of seats in the Parliament before the 2014 elections to take account of the accession of Croatia in 2013. </p><p>  Under Article 14.2, the composition of the European Parliament is decided by the European Council by unanimity on the initiative of the Parliament and with its consent.  Therefore the right of initiative in relation to this issue rests with the European Parliament.  The Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament (AFCO) had its first consideration of a draft report on 22 January 2013.  AFCO will further consider the draft report over the coming weeks and a vote in the European Parliament is planned for the March plenary session.  When Parliament has agreed on its proposal the matter will come to the European Council.  The Parliament must also give its consent to the decision reached by the European Council.</p></reply>

This mechanism allows for the deployment, at short notice, of highly skilled experts to support humanitarian operations worldwide.  In 2012, members of the Irish Aid Rapid Response Corps deployed on 36 occasions to countries including, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, Myanmar, Somalia and South Sudan.</p><p>In addition, eight Irish civilian experts were deployed in 2012 to European Union civilian crisis management missions including the EU&rsquo;s Police Missions in Afghanistan and the occupied Palestinian territory; the EU&rsquo;s Rule of Law Missions in Kosovo and Iraq; and the EU&rsquo;s Monitoring Mission in Georgia.</p><p>The Government believes that international election monitoring missions have an important role to play in the promotion of human rights and democracy, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions.  We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.</p><p>In 2012 observers nominated by Ireland have been involved in missions organised by the EU and OSCE.</p><p>In 2012, Ireland was invited by the European Union to nominate observers to participate in election observation missions to Senegal, Algeria, Timor Leste and Sierra Leone.

In this way the Fund&rsquo;s assets can be used as a catalyst to attract additional capital for investment in the Irish economy. </p><p>  Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency in preparing proposals for legislation to refocus the NPRF on investment in Ireland under the Strategic Investment Fund initiative.

Indeed data from the CSO&rsquo;s Residential Property Price Index show that national prices have been broadly stable for 9 months now, with prices in Dublin experiencing upward price pressure towards in the latter part of 2012. Indeed recent releases by both Daft.ie and myHome.ie have pointed to the same outcome. </p><p>  Whilst some commentators attributed some of the stabilisation to the ending of mortgage interest relief to new first-time buyers, it is not possible to separate out this effect from wider economic factors. Indeed, even if the ending of the relief did lead to an increase in transactions this may be because first-time buyers brought forward their planned purchases from 2013 to 2012 so as to benefit from mortgage interest relief. This may therefore have helped to stabilise property prices whilst the fundamentals of the economy improved. It is therefore hoped that stability will be maintained in 2013 and beyond with further improvements in economic fundamentals without the need for further measures.</p><p>  I would like to point out that there are a number of economic considerations that might mitigate against such a scheme going forward. </p><p>  Firstly, it is not clear that such a subsidy is necessary in the current environment. The price of housing is now at an affordable level for most individuals, with prices at a low level for housing suitable for first-time buyers. Providing a subsidy to mortgages would risk distorting a natural and sustainable growth in prices in the medium term. It would also need to be borne in mind, that a universal subsidy may not be the best way of making housing affordable to those who may have difficulties in securing mortgages as it also benefits those without difficulties. </p><p>  There is also the consideration that subsidies of this kind very often result in higher purchase prices and higher mortgages rather than more affordable housing and mortgages as the subsidy is generally passed through to the purchase price. To the extent that the mortgage interest subsidy results in higher prices and larger borrowings, I would be concerned that it would not in fact free up cash flow for the economy. </p><p>  Even if some of the subsidy does in fact result in greater disposable income, it is not clear that the income would be spent on additional consumption in the domestic economy. Given the high import propensity of a small open economy like Ireland, there is a risk that any additional expenditure would leak out of the economy. This of course assumes that individuals would actually spend any additional disposable income rather than saving or paying down extra capital on their mortgage. This would mean that the exchequer gains from the measure referred to by the Deputy may be overstated.</p><p>  In addition, you will also appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current significant budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

However, in Finance Act 2010, mortgage interest relief was extended up to the end of 2017 for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after (i.e. those who purchased in 2004 or after). </p><p>  Accordingly, individuals who took out qualifying loans in the period 2004 to 2012 will continue to be entitled to mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.   </p><p>It should be noted that, where there is an entitlement to mortgage interest relief, it is available at varying rates and subject to certain ceilings.  For example, individuals who are in the <i>first seven tax years of their qualifying loan</i> are entitled to a higher interest ceiling, on which the rate of relief is applied.  For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &#8364;10,000 per annum for a single individual and &#8364;20,000 per annum for married couples and civil partnerships. For individuals who have an entitlement to mortgage interest relief and who are in their <i>eighth or subsequent years of their qualifying loan</i>   a lower interest ceiling applies. For such individuals, the interest ceilings are &#8364;3,000 per annum for single and &#8364;6,000 per annum for married couples/civil partnerships. Therefore, some individuals will experience a reduction in the level of relief they receive as they enter into their eighth and subsequent years of their qualifying loans.  However, they will continue to receive mortgage interest relief up until the end of 2017.  </p><p>  Furthermore, as you are aware, this Government is fully committed to helping address the particular problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I announced my intention to fulfil the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  </p><p>First time buyers will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 <i>or</i> if they drew down their mortgage in that period. The rate of tax relief on the interest paid on such loans will, for the tax years 2012 to 2017, be 30%.  A document which illustrates the maximum gains for such individuals is available on the Department of Finance&#8217;s tax policy website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>  . </p></reply>

While the supply of building materials is in general subject to VAT at the standard rate of 23%, Ireland applies a reduced rate of 13.5% to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks.  In addition, where a building contractor carries out home improvements and the materials cost does not exceed two-thirds of the cost of the improvements then the reduced rate of 13.5% applies to the total building service.  A consequence of this is that a VAT registered building contractor will generally be entitled to recover VAT at the 23% standard rate on most building materials purchased while the contractor is only liable to charge VAT at the 13.5% reduced rate on the supply to the home owner.  </p><p>  The VAT rating of goods is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The application of the 13.5% rate to construction work and building materials is the subject of a derogation from EU VAT law, where most other EU Member States apply higher rates of VAT to building materials. In this context, home improvement works are already incentivised through the VAT system.</p></reply>

Last week also saw the remnants of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish removed from the financial and political landscape.</p><p>  The Irish Government has been working extremely hard to secure a deal on the Irish bank debt and in particular, in recent months on the issue of the IBRC Promissory Notes.  This involved intense discussions with the ECB on all options in relation to the promissory notes, such as the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate applicable, the structure of repayment etc.  These engagements with our European partners took on a number of forms and the proposal developed over time.  A single technical paper was not the sum total of this process, given the scale and complexity of the matter.  Needless to say, the announcements last week reflect the finalisation of this work.</p><p>  I am satisfied that every available and appropriate opportunity to advance Ireland&rsquo;s position in relation to legacy bank debt with our European partners has been availed of and that every effort to maintain the issue of the remaining Irish bank debt at the top of the European agenda will continue to be made.</p></reply>

However, the Government is still heavily involved in drawing up the operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area Summit statement.</p><p>  The European Council stated on 14 December 2012 that &ldquo;once an effective SSM is established, the ESM will be able to recapitalise banks directly. An agreement on the operational framework supporting this possibility, including the definition of legacy assets, should be agreed as soon as possible in the first semester of 2013&rdquo;.</p><p>  Ireland continues to be fully engaged in this process within the Eurogroup and among Heads of State or Government. Furthermore, officials from my Department also attend technical meetings with the ESM and other member states. In this regard, discussions remain on-going and no conclusion has been reached. </p><p>  Notwithstanding these discussions, I also will continue to explore any market opportunities to  get  a return of any of the sums used to bail out the banks. </p></reply>

Due to the restricted number of banking days in the month of December, it was deemed necessary to ultilise this provision for cash flow purposes as payovers of the Social Insurance Fund&rsquo;s PRSI income, which is collected via the Revenue ROS system, may be subject to payment transfer delay. An advance of 300 million euro, which was made from the Central Fund, was repaid in full by the Social Insurance Fund on 28 December 2012 upon the receipt of sufficient PRSI income. The repayment is reflected in the 2012 December Exchequer Statement. There are currently no advances from the Central Fund to the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>  Since mid-2010, the Social Insurance Fund is in receipt of subvention from voted moneys in order to bridge the gap between its income and expenditure. This subvention is provided for under section 9 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. As a normal part of the subvention funding, the Fund will receive advances from the Paymaster General&rsquo;s Supply Account, which in turn is funded from issues from the Central Fund. I am advised by the Department of Social Protection that at 31 December 2012 such advances were of the order of 125 million euro.This amount was not repayable by virtue of the subvention arrangement and as it was expended it  become a charge on the Vote for Social Protection in January 2013 in accordance with Public Financial Procedures. 	</p></reply>

This press statement sets out that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases. The ECB have also stated that OMT may also be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme &ldquo;when they will be regaining bond market access&rdquo;. </p><p>  I believe the ECB&rsquo;s announcement regarding its OMT programme is a significant development and is viewed as such by the financial markets.  </p><p>  The ECB press statement also notes that the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  The decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is therefore a matter for the ECB.</p></reply>

The conditionality in these documents is subject to continuing assessment by the Irish Authorities and the EU, IMF, ECB (the Troika) to ensure the board programme objectives are met. Such assessment is undertaken at the quarterly reviews. These reviews include discussions where programme commitments are updated and agreed after every mission.   The introduction of a property tax has been a condition of the Programme since it was first negotiated in November 2010, and has remained a condition following subsequent reviews.  In relation to the programme documents dated December 2010 the MEFP made reference to the introduction of a new residential-property based site value tax while the MOU, referred to the introduction of a property tax. Since then, in both the MOU and MEFP, the reference of the property tax has developed as the programme documents have been agreed after each review mission. The most recent references in the programme documents has been to a value-based property tax. All the programme documents referred to are available on the department website.</p><p>  In light of the complex issues involved in a full property tax, the Government decided to introduce the Household Charge, a flat charge of &euro;100, in 2012 as an interim measure.  The Household Charge was a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and has been abolished with effect from the 1 January 2013.  </p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 was signed into law by the President on 26 December 2012. Under this legislation a local property tax charge will be payable on all relevant residential properties from 1 July 2013.</p><p>  The Government decided that that the basis of assessment for the Local Property Tax should be market value, as recommended by the inter-Departmental Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;), which considered the structures and modalities of a property tax.  I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 127 of 18 December 2012 (56634/12) for more details on the group&rsquo;s analysis, and to the report itself, which is available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

This includes payment by way of deduction at source from employment or occupational pension income.   The liability to LPT is not affected by the income of the couple.  However, the couple&rsquo;s gross income is taken into account in establishing whether they qualify for full or partial deferral of the tax, regardless of whether the property is in the name of one member of the couple or in joint names.  Therefore, where the residential property is the sole or main residence of the couple and their joint estimated gross income from all sources does not exceed &euro;25,000 during the relevant year, they will be eligible to apply for full deferral of the LPT charge.  Gross income from all sources in this context consists of both spouse&rsquo;s total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.  To determine whether deferral applies for 2013, the couple is required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what their total gross income for 2013 will be. </p><p>  The couple will qualify for deferral of 50% of the LPT liability where both spouse&rsquo;s estimated gross income from all sources is less than &euro;35,000 for the year.  The balance of 50% of the tax must be paid.  Where the property was purchased with a mortgage, the thresholds of &euro;25,000 and &euro;35,000 are increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments.  </p><p>  The deferral thresholds of &euro;25,000 and &euro;35,000 apply to civil partners and cohabitants as well as to married couples.</p></reply>

Neither could I advise a customer whether or not to dispose of a property.   I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulty.  In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217;.</p><p>  A number of significant milestones have now been achieved:-</p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Act was signed into law by the President on the 26 December 2012.  The Act will now be subject to a commencement order by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence</p><p>- The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis;</p><p>- Lenders have provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed forbearance and loan modification options which will be made available, in appropriate cases, to their customers who are in mortgage difficulty.  The roll out of these options has commenced with Central Bank oversight;</p><p>- An extensive independent mortgage advice framework has been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i>   (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.</p><p>  In addition, the Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears is also key protection and provides that each bank must put in place a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and for the establishment of dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases.</p><p>  In relation to the details provided by the Deputy, I have been informed by the lender concerned that it encourages customers facing mortgage difficulties to make immediate contact, so that appropriate options can be discussed, agreed, and progressed. As a starting point, the borrower should make an appointment with the local branch to arrange to complete a &#8216;Standard Financial Statement&#8217;, a key element of the sector wide Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process. </p></reply>

In that regard, the housing policy statement, published in June 2011 by that Department, signalled a shift to a tenure neutral high level objective and a clear commitment to restoring balance to the housing sector generally through a lesser reliance on home ownership.  As such, Government will not act to prioritise one form of housing tenure over another.  Nevertheless, the policy statement reaffirms the State&#8217;s commitment to supporting access to home ownership for lower to middle income households and the current range of paths to home ownership that are facilitated by house purchase loans from local authorities will remain in place in that regard. I should also add that direct lending to Approved Housing Bodies in the voluntary and co-operative housing sectors is now in place through the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) which operates under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and full details of the activities of the HFA can be found on the Agency&#8217;s website, <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>  .   </p><p>  Regarding the provision of mortgage finance for home purchase more generally, this Government is pursuing a number of actions to ensure that an increased, but financially sustainable, level of mortgage credit will be available to new borrowers from commercial lenders to meet the needs of the economy and society.  This includes the very significant restructuring and right sizing of the banking sector to make it more focused on the real needs of the economy and the resolution of the existing problem of significant mortgage arrears and unsustainable mortgage debt which is acting as a drag on economic improvement.  </p><p>  Ultimately the Government is of the view that it is the regeneration of the economy, the restoration of employment levels and income growth that will provide the real social and economic improvements that will be required.  That is why Government is focused through its many new initiatives at fostering and generating economic growth.  The successful achievement of this objective will restore consumer confidence and bring the tangible and sustainable recovery that the country requires.</p><p>  On the issue of financial inclusion, the Government has already commenced the process of providing universal access to basic banking services.  The introduction of a Basic Payment Account is part of the Department of Finance&#8217;s Strategy for Financial Inclusion in Ireland.  The Basic Payment Account is being developed as a gateway product for wider financial inclusion, that is, access to insurance, savings and credit products and work on introducing a Basic Payment Account in Ireland by certain providers commenced in 2012.  Following an evaluation process, a full national rollout is planned for this year.</p></reply>

If the proceeds of a compulsory acquisition were gifted or inherited, then capital acquisitions tax would be payable by reference to the normal criteria and thresholds, depending on the relationship between the parties.  If on a gift or inheritance of agricultural property CAT agricultural relief is claimed by a farmer donee/successor (such that the value of the land is reduced by 90% for the purposes of calculating any CAT payable) and that land is subsequently acquired by compulsory purchase within 6 years of the gift or inheritance, the agricultural relief claimed on the gift or inheritance will be withdrawn unless the proceeds of the compulsory purchase are reinvested in other agricultural property within 6 years of the compulsory purchase (there is provision for partial withdrawal where only part of the proceeds are reinvested).</p><p>  The first &euro;3,000 of the total taxable value of all taxable gifts taken by a donee in any calendar year is exempt.</p></reply>

As I have previously informed the House, I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that following receipt of data from the DSP in late 2011 containing details of DSP pension payments, it emerged that some pensioners with significant other income had not previously declared their DSP pension for tax purposes.  Revenue&rsquo;s approach was, firstly, to ensure that the record was correct for 2012 and thereafter to examine in detail the largest cases where there was a mismatch between their records and the DSP record, beginning with cases where annual non-DSP income exceeded &euro;50,000.

The report notes that increasing the income thresholds will have an impact on the rate of property tax that will be applied.  As the income threshold increases the rate will also be required to increase to achieve the same revenue yields.</p><p>  The Thornhill Group, in its approach to exemptions, considered that the local property tax should be centred on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity.  In terms of these principles, it was also considered that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  The Group considered that waivers were an inefficient and costly method of targeting reliefs, whereas voluntary deferrals can be used to address cases where there is an inability to pay.</p><p>  The Government agreed with the Thornhill Group&rsquo;s recommendations that exemptions should be limited and voluntary deferrals were more appropriate for addressing issues of inability to pay.  Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 sets out provisions for deferral of the local property tax charge.  The deferral of the charge is granted under specific conditions.  Where the residential property is the sole or main residence of a liable person and her, his or their estimated gross income from all sources does not exceed &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple during the year covered by the return, she/he/they will be eligible to apply for full deferral of the LPT charge.  </p><p>  In addition, for income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, an adjusted gross income limit will apply.  In these cases, the income thresholds of &euro;15,000 or &euro;25,000 may be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  This type of deferral is available until the end of 2017.</p><p>  Moreover, owner-occupiers may be eligible to apply for partial deferral where the gross income from all sources is less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  For income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, these thresholds may also be increased by 80% of the annual mortgage interest payments.  In these cases the owner-occupier will qualify for deferrals of 50% of the LPT liability and the balance of 50% of the tax must be paid.</p><p>  In recommending the income thresholds the Thornhill Group had regard to the analysis from the ESRI report.  An income level of &euro;25,000 for joint and co-owners/spouses/civil partners/cohabitees was recommended in order to enable most households in the lowest 40% of income levels to have the option of deferral.  This is considered appropriate, having regard to the findings in the ESRI study regarding potential impacts on households and having regard to the need for balance and equity in terms of the burden thereby imposed on those with higher (but still average or below average) incomes. </p><p>  The income level of &euro;15,000 for a single person is derived by applying an &ldquo;equivalence&rdquo; scale used by the ESRI.  That scale is broadly reflected in social welfare payment rates i.e. for any given payment type, such as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or State Pension, the payment rate for a couple is broadly 166% that of a single person and is widely accepted internationally.</p><p>  The Government accepted the income thresholds for a full deferral recommended by the Thornhill Group, and adapted the income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are &euro;10,000 rather than &euro;5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral. </p><p>  I do not plan to introduce different categories of waivers for people on lower incomes.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to protect policy holders in the event of their insurer becoming insolvent. It is an industry financed fund.  However because the scheme is not pre-funded, the Act provides for the Exchequer to advance monies on the recommendation of the Central Bank in circumstances where insufficient funds have been generated by an industry levy to cover a large demand.  Under the Insurance Act 1964 the responsibility for deciding whether the ICF has sufficient funds available to it to at any particular time is a matter for the Central Bank.  Where in the Bank&rsquo;s opinion the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State.  On the basis of its assessment of the Fund the Central Bank concluded that a levy should be applied to industry with effect from 1 January 2012 under section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964.</p><p>I estimate that in the region of &euro;337m will be paid into the ICF in 2013 made up of a total advance of &euro;272m from the Exchequer plus &euro;65m from the ICF levy.</p><p>At the end of December 2012 the total amount due from the ICF to the State was &euro;762m.  There was an additional advance in January 2013 of &euro;154m which brings the total amount outstanding at the end of January 2013 to &euro;916m.  This information is set out in the table below.</p><p>It should be noted that I would expect the ICF to be in a position to start repaying the State from about 2015. Based on information currently available it is estimated that it will take in the region of 12 to 15 years from the commencement of repayment for the Exchequer to recover its advances in full.</p><p>Finally, you should be aware that the interest rate that applies to the advances is 250bp over the 6 month Euribor rate.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th><div>Advance</div></th><th><div>Interest due*</div></th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td><div>&#8364;280m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;1.84m</div></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td><div>&#8364;455m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;25.20m</div></td></tr><tr><td>2013 to date</td><td><div>&#8364;154m</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total Amount due at the End of January 2013</td><td><div>&#8364;916.04m</div></td><td>* There will be interest due on the amount outstanding at the end of 2013</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The relief is confined to an amount not exceeding 10 per cent of the individual&rsquo;s total income for any tax year.  Where the premium is paid by an individual&rsquo;s employer and is taxed on the individual as a perquisite, the premium is treated as having been paid by the employee and qualifies for relief.  The relief is given as a deduction from total income.  Tax relief is, therefore, effectively allowed at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate.  While part of the cost of contributions to permanent health benefit schemes is not identifiable as a result of a move to a &ldquo;net pay&rdquo; basis of contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the identifiable cost to the Exchequer for the income tax year 2010, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed historical information is available, is estimated at &euro;3.9 million. </p></reply>

The Deputy should note that there are certain other exemptions, such as the artist's exemption, which provide that the relevant income does not come into charge at all.

For example, Case V losses can only be set against Case V profits.  Moreover, it should be noted that virtually all incentive reliefs are subject to the high earners&rsquo; restriction provided for in section 485C.  The aim of this relief is to ensure that high earners who are subject to the restriction in full can only use so much of these reliefs in any one year as will leave them with an effective tax rate of 30%.  Any relief not used in a year can be carried forward to future years.</p><p>  Relief in respect of any claim by a taxpayer, where relief may be allowed at the marginal rate, is only allowed at that marginal rate where the taxpayer is otherwise paying tax at that rate.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department met with the school concerned in September last to discuss the school's current position in relation to the undertakings and with a view to enabling the school to meet the permanent  recognition criteria as soon as possible. In that regard, my Department has since confirmed to the school that its provisional recognition has been extended for three years to 31 August 2015. This extension will allow the school the time necessary to progress the implementation of the changes in practice required to comply with the undertakings committed to by the school. This extension of the school's provisional recognition will also not impede the school being granted permanent recognition within that period if the criteria for recognition are satisfactorily met.</p></reply>

In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the rights of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Equality legislation, which also outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The legislation provides that any school that has this objective may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2011, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The &quot;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&quot; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent and is available on the Department website.</p><p>  I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by 28 October 2011. The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment. I intend to bring these proposals to Government in due course.</p></reply>

In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools with additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. My Department supports provision in some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of over 5,000 children with autism. The NCSE will continue to establish more classes, as required.</p></reply>

The economic situation has meant that very difficult decisions have had to be taken in order to make expenditure savings and to ensure that teacher numbers remain within the Public Service Employment Control Framework.</p><p>  Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching should receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.  All schools should select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.</p><p>  Limited alleviation measures have been provided to assist schools which have high numbers or concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by Resource Teacher for Travellers (RTT) posts.</p><p>  As at the end of January 2011 the number of Resource Teachers for Travellers employed amounted to a total of 709.54 WTE posts nationwide, being made up of 488 posts at primary school level and 221.54 posts at post primary level.</p><p>  Traveller enrolments were included in the valid enrolment for the purpose of allocating additional staffing under DEIS from the 2011/12 school year. 81 posts were used for this readjustment.</p><p>  Post Primary schools and non DEIS PTR enhanced Primary schools were allocated alleviation posts on the basis of having 33 or more pupils in their schools previously supported by RTT posts.  38 such alleviation posts were allocated to schools, including 18 posts at post primary school level.</p><p>  Some 22 additional alleviation posts were also allocated to the Post Primary schools and Primary schools who had the highest percentage of traveller pupils previously supported by RTT posts, in comparison to other schools, taking into account their overall pupil populations, and who had not qualified for the first round of alleviation posts.  This included 3 posts at post primary level.</p><p>  A total of 141 posts were therefore used for adjustment, alleviation, or additional alleviation for schools, giving an overall net reduction of 568.54 posts, with an approximate saving of &euro;34m per annum.  </p><p>  Some 141 adjustment, alleviation, or compensatory posts were provided in 2012 and the same number are being provided in 2013, at an estimated cost of &euro;8.4m.  </p><p>  It should be noted that the General Allocation Model which provides additional learning support and resource teaching allocations for primary schools was updated for all primary schools for the 2012/13 school year and included the traveller pupils who had previously been supported by RTT posts under the General Allocation Model.</p><p>  The total number of Resource Teacher for Traveller posts or posts providing extra tuition for traveller post primary pupils for the years from 2008-2013 are as follows:</p><p>Total Traveller Allocation:</p><p>2008/2009 - 205;</p><p>2009/2010 - 226;</p><p>2010/2011 - 225;</p><p>2011/2012 - 21;</p><p>2012/2013 - 21;</p><p>2013/2014 - 21.</p><p>  The posts from 2011/12 are the alleviation posts provided at post primary level.  </p><p>  In relation to the Visiting Teacher for Traveller posts, under the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers (VTST) was also discontinued from September 2011.  A total of 40 Whole Time equivalent posts were withdrawn as a result of this measure at an estimated saving cost of &euro;2.4m.</p><p>  In September 2009 management of the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers was assigned to the National Education Welfare Board to be integrated with School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison and the Education Welfare services to provide a more focussed approach to deliver better outcomes for children and families, including the Traveller Community.  Responsibility for the NEWB and its services transferred to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with effect from May 2011.  The two departments continue to work together to ensure that the services in the NEWB, including the SCP, the HSCL and the EWS will have a renewed focus to more effectively target and support all children at risk, including Traveller children.  The NEWB is currently developing its new integrated service in schools, One Child, One Team, One Plan: NEWB Service Delivery for DEIS and non-DEIS schools.</p></reply>

The Strategy covers, in a very comprehensive manner, aspects of Traveller Education from pre-school right through to further and higher education within a lifelong learning context.</p><p>  The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy and, accordingly, the focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation. In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.</p><p>  A number of other decisions and policy changes have resulted in the allocation of resources to ensure their most appropriate use in an inclusive education system.  These include fulfilling the recommendations of the Traveller Education Strategy, the National Recovery Plan 2011 - 2014 as well as the implementation of Value for Money Reviews of School Transport and Senior Traveller Training Centres.</p><p>  I have arranged for the financial information requested by the Deputy to be forwarded to him by my Department.</p></reply>

It would not be appropriate to comment on possible future implementation arrangements whilst those discussions are ongoing. </p><p>  In regard to the verification of savings under the present agreement, I wish to make a number of points.  Firstly, the Implementation Body is required to assess the savings being facilitated under the framework of the Agreement on an annual basis.  As part of this annual review process, savings returns are completed and returned to the Body in respect of every sector, Department and Office.  These returns are required to be signed off by relevant accounting officers. </p><p>  Secondly, the Agreement allows for the engagement of external financial advisors to undertake independent verification of reported savings.  This involves a review of the methodology, quantification and estimation used by managements to identify savings that have been achieved and savings that will be achieved as a result of agreements reached and initiatives taken.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible, on time and cost grounds to externally evaluate every saving made under the Agreement.  Therefore, the approach the Body has taken has been to put forward a number of significant projects each year for external evaluation.  This verification process serves as a useful quality assurance check on what is being reported and public service management are aware that progress reported may be subject to such external evaluation.</p><p>  The Body has carried out two annual reviews to date.  Those reviews found that approximately &#8364;1.5 billion in savings has been achieved during the first two years of the Agreement, comprising of &#8364;810m and &#8364;678m in sustainable pay bill and non-pay (efficiency) savings respectively.</p><p>  Significantly, the external financial accountants engaged under both annual reviews found that, in all cases, the savings reported were reasonable estimates of the savings that have arisen or will arise due to the successful implementation of the projects concerned.  I understand that a similar verification exercise is being undertaken for the Body&#8217;s third annual review (currently underway).</p><p>  In regard to the question of private sector representation on the Implementation Body, it is important to point out that the Public Service Agreement is an agreement between the Government, as employer, and its employees, represented by the public service unions.  The Implementation Body is, accordingly, comprised of the representatives of the parties to the Agreement &#8211; this is provided for under its terms &#8211; and so the issue of private sector membership does not arise.  However, I understand that the Chair of the Body, who is independent, has briefed private sector interests on a number of occasions on behalf of the Body and is happy to continue to do so.  I am satisfied that the Body has approached its task in a thorough, transparent and objective manner, as evidenced by its two Annual Progress Reports published to date.</p></reply>

The consultation process undertaken on this commitment was based on the OECD Principles for Transparency and Integrity in lobbying which recommend that it may be necessary to impose a &lsquo;cooling-off&rsquo; period that temporarily restricts former public officials from lobbying their past organisations.  My proposals in this area - which draw on the Outside Appointments Board model applying to senior civil servants - will be published following consideration by Government as part of the General Scheme of a Regulation of Lobbying Bill. </p><p>  The relevant OECD principles also highlight the requirement for countries to consider establishing restrictions for public officials leaving office to address other potential conflict of interest situations that could arise.

It serves as a repository for notices above EU thresholds and which must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union.  In accordance with policy guidelines from my Department contracting authorities are also obliged to publish all tender notices for goods and services with a value greater than &#8364;25,000 on the eTender website.</p><p>  An upgrade to the site was launched on 12<sup>th</sup> November 2012.  The new site, as well as publishing contract notices has a wide range of additional functionality that in effect will allow other aspects of the procurement process to be completed electronically, including assessment, awarding and contract management.  This additional functionality is improving and generating efficiencies for both the public and private sectors.</p><p>  Prior to launching the new site, the supplier representative bodies including Chambers Ireland, IBEC, ISME and the Small Firms Association were briefed on the new system and electronic copies of Supplier User Manuals were supplied to them for distribution to their respective membership.  The National Procurement Service meets these bodies on a regular basis.</p><p>  Prior to the launch, registered Suppliers and Buyers on the system were also informed about the proposed change of system and user manuals were sent to each of them electronically.  Suppliers were also informed of the up-coming change of system at various Meet the Buyer events and other such seminars.</p><p>  Prior to and since the launch of the new site, the NPS has organised a number of demonstrations for Buyers on the new site.  Since the system went live on 12<sup>th</sup> November demonstrations of the new system have been given to suppliers at Meet the Buyer events.  The National Procurement Service has also agreed with the Construction Industry Federation to give a seminar on the new system to them on a date to be agreed.</p><p>  In 2012, there were 6,439 notices published on eTenders.  It is not possible to quantify how many of these tenders had more than one element. The National Procurement Service has begun the task of collating procurement statistics for the year 2012, in accordance with our EU obligations.  This statistical information should be available later in 2013.</p><p>  During the week beginning 12th November, the first week the system went live; supplier and buyers received unsolicited marketing emails from the previous operator of the service, marketing a new service.  This email contained a username and password for their website, which caused widespread confusion among public sector Buyers and Suppliers as many of them thought these credentials were for the new eTenders system.</p><p>  Most of the complaints since the launch of the new site relate to the confusion caused by this email and the National Procurement Service communicated with registered Buyers and Suppliers to clarify the issue.</p><p>  While there were thousands of queries in relation to the new site and its functionality, the Helpdesk statistics for the first three months after its launch record only 22 complaints in relation to the new site, the majority of these in the first two weeks.  I received nine representations making complaints in relation to the new site.  The complaints relate to alerts to suppliers and the search function on the site, both of which have now been resolved; as well as the site design.  Since then the Helpdesk receives on average in the region of 250 routine calls per day.</p></reply>

This is enforced through a number of measures which include:-</p><p>- the display of the relevant clause on the site in a location that is readily accessible to all those employed on the site;</p><p>- a requirement for a certificate from the contractor with each payment application stating that all those employed on the works are paid in accordance with the REA;</p><p>- withholding of any payment if the certificate is not provided;</p><p>- a deduction from sums due to the main contractor of the amounts due to workers in accordance with the REA if a certificate is subsequently found to be false, and;</p><p>- termination of the contract in the case of a persistent breach.</p><p>  Under a public works contract the contractual relationship is between the public body and the main contractor.  The public body does not conduct the procurement process for each sub-contract package under a public works contract; this is carried out by the main contractor who is not subject to the rules governing public procurement.</p><p>  The management of a public works contract is a matter between a contracting authority and a main contractor.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that contractors comply with all the requirements of the contract. </p><p>  Whilst the requirements to follow REA conditions may be a procurement matter, it is the National Employments Rights Authority that has the responsibility for monitoring employment conditions through its inspection services and can enforce employment rights compliance and seek redress.  This agency comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise &amp; Innovation, Mr. Richard Bruton T.D.  If the Deputy is aware of specific instances where firms may not be complying with relevant statutory pay and conditions of employment, the matter can be referred to NERA for investigation.</p></reply>

This is the basis on which the Council will now seek the consent of the European Parliament to the MFF Regulation.   </p><p>  The European Council agreed, <i>inter alia</i>  , that a gradual macro-economic conditionality will be established in the regulation governing the Common Strategic Framework (CSF) Funds, which includes the European Social Fund, in order to establish a closer link between Cohesion policy and the economic governance of the Union, so that the effectiveness of expenditure under the CSF Funds is underpinned by sound economic policies and that the CSF Funds can, if necessary, be redirected to addressing the economic problems a country is facing. </p><p>  The question of the suspension of funding would only arise where a Member State fails to take effective action in relation to its Partnership Contract and the relevant programmes or fails to comply with EU economic and fiscal policy requirements.  Any decisions on suspensions would have to be proportionate and effective, taking into account the economic and social circumstances of the Member State concerned, and would have to respect equality of treatment between Member States, in particular with regard to the impact of the suspension on the economy of the Member State concerned.

This includes new Oireachtas Members as defined in the Act.</p><p>  - Under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009, Ministerial pensions are no longer payable to sitting Members of the Oireachtas following the last general election, or to Members of the European Parliament following the next elections to the Parliament. No current Oireachtas Member is paid a Ministerial pension.</p><p>  - Public Service pensions for persons (including former Ministers and members of the Oireachtas) who retired after February 2012 are reduced in line with the substantial pay reductions applied across the Public Service under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts. For those who retired before the end of February the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) applies. I recently provided for an increase in the rate of PSPR that applies to pensions over &#8364;100,000 to 20% (in addition to all other deductions). </p><p>- The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>  , introduced a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme with a new minimum pension age of 66, rising in due course with the age at which the State Pension (Contributory) will become payable. This scheme will also apply to all new Members of the Oireachtas, including new entrant Ministers, as defined in the Act. The Act also provides pensions for all Public Servants who are subject to this Act to be based on career average earnings, as opposed to the current final salary basis.</p><p>  In addition, I announced in my Budget speech that severance payments payable to Ministers and other Officeholders upon cessation of Office are to be abolished. The necessary legislation is currently being prepared in my Department. </p><p>  It is to be noted that I am advised that as a pension is generally taken to be deferred income it is therefore covered by the constitutional protections that apply to property.</p></reply>

In this regard, my colleague Minister of State Brian Hayes is working with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  The issue of whether the Bill should require all construction contracts to ensure that the payer is solvent (i.e. through the purchase of a financial product such as a bond) was examined during the consultation and Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of the Bill. The RIA found that requiring payer to purchase bonds would reduce competition in the sector as such financial products are not widely available in the current market and the costs associated with purchasing them would be a barrier to entry for smaller contractors. Therefore the provisions necessary to provide security of payment would increase the regulatory burden and costs associated with contracts between clients, contractors, subcontractors and the final consumer. </p><p>  In addition, during the Second Stage reading of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, Minister Hayes made a number of points that address the issues raised by the Deputy:</p><p>  - In relation to payment difficulties that are linked to business failures, the Bill will not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation/receivership or Prompt Payment regulations.  However, the Bill includes two key provisions that will reduce the exposure of subcontractors to non-payment in the event of a business failure.</p><p>  - Firstly, &ldquo;pay-when-paid&rdquo; clauses will no longer be permitted in construction contracts.  This means, for example, that sub-contractors or sub-sub-contractors will no longer be dependant on a main contractor getting paid before they are entitled to receive their own payments.</p><p>  - Secondly, all construction contracts will have to contain a payments schedule that clearly sets out both interim payments and final payments, and the sums due in each case.  The contract will have to set out clearly when payment of these amounts will fall due.  If a contract fails to specify these matters, then the terms set out in the Schedule to the Bill will apply. The Schedule sets out default arrangements for contract payment terms.  These will be minimum standards for sub-contracts.  This is a major innovation which should reduce the exposure of sub-contractors to non-payment.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal that the Bill should cover both public and private contracts, I assume the Deputy is referring to the issue of making adjudication awards binding for both the public and private sectors. This is a complex issue which makes it important to strike the right balance between giving this legislation the necessary enforcement provisions, whilst ensuring that the application of the legislation is equitable and the taxpayer is safeguarded.</p><p>  These and a number of other issues have been examined; Minister Hayes will shortly bring proposals to Government in advance of Committee Stage. This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. Therefore it is essential that these complex issues are properly assessed so as to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others. </p></reply>

In qualifying for inclusion in tender competitions for public works contracts, applicants must submit signed declarations stating that none of the circumstances outlined in Regulation 53 of SI 329 of 2006 <i>European Communities (Award of Public Contracts) Regulations 2006</i> or Article 45 and 51 of 2004/18/EC, the EU Directive<i> on the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts</i>   apply.  </p><p>  The list of exclusions in Article 45 and Regulation 53 are divided into two categories, the first deals with mandatory exclusions and the second deals with discretionary exclusions.  An applicant may be excluded from a procurement process if:</p><p>  - they are bankrupt or their affairs are being wound up;</p><p>  - they are subject to proceedings leading to a declaration of bankruptcy or;</p><p>  - they have defaulted in payment of taxes or social insurance contributions.</p><p>  However they must be given an opportunity to establish whether there are mitigating circumstances.  The Contracting Authority must investigate the event thoroughly before a decision is taken on the course of action to take.</p><p>  In a public works tender, applicants are obliged to submit a signed declaration on oath which must be sworn in the last 12 months.  This must be witnessed by a practising solicitor or Commissioner for Oaths and should be accompanied with a signed confirmation that the applicant&#8217;s legal situation has not changed in any way which would prohibit the applicant from making a new declaration on oath on the same basis since the declaration was made and signed.  Applicants from Ireland and the UK must provide a declaration on oath. In countries where a declaration on oath does not exist, the applicant can instead make a solemn declaration in their country of origin or in the country whence the applicant comes before a judicial or administrative authority, a notary or a competent professional or trade body.</p><p>  Prior to the award of the works contract, the successful applicant is also required to produce a current Notification of Determination (formerly C2 certificate) from the Revenue Commissioners. </p></reply>

In order to facilitate the nomination process, estimates were included in the tender documents for the main contractor to cover the works packages to be undertaken by the specialist sub-contractor or supplies in the case of the specialist supplier.  These estimates, known as Prime Cost or PC Sums, were based upon a quotation for the works or supply concerned or upon typical rates for the work or supply already known to the design team.  Separate tenders for these specialist works or supplies packages were undertaken and, based upon the outcome of the tender, the successful sub-contractor or supplier was &lsquo;nominated&rsquo; to the already appointed main contractor by way of an instruction from the Architect named in the contract.  That instruction included direction to the main contractor to expend the PC Sum and provision was made for an adjustment to the contract sum depending on whether the tender for the particular package was greater or less than the PC Sum.</p><p>  One of the key requirements of the Government&rsquo;s Construction Procurement Reform Initiative is to ensure greater cost certainty at contract award stage and in order to meet this requirement it was decided to dispense with the nomination of specialist sub-contractors and suppliers because the final contract sum could not be established until well after the main contractor was appointed.  This places the onus on the appointed design team to ensure that reasonably detailed information is supplied as part of the tender documents to ensure that the tenders received reflect the quality of installation required.</p><p>  Contracting authorities may ensure that quality specialist sub-contractors are employed on public works contracts by requiring such specialists to pre-qualify with the main contractor.  This is achieved by naming particular specialist works areas in the pre-qualification documents.  The main contractor must name one specialist in their Form of Tender for each of the specialist works areas defined by the contracting authority.</p></reply>

Therefore the provisions necessary to provide security of payment would increase the regulatory burden and costs associated with contracts between clients, contractors, subcontractors and the final consumer.</p><p>  Whilst it will not cut across the normal rules for company liquidation/receivership or Prompt Payment regulations, the Construction Contracts Bill includes two key provisions that will reduce the exposure of subcontractors to non-payment in the event of a business failure.</p><p>  - A requirement for all construction contracts to include a payment schedule.  In the event that a contract fails to provide a payment schedule then the terms set out in the Schedule to the Bill will apply. </p><p>  - Pay when paid clauses will no longer be permitted meaning that sub-contractors are no longer dependent on the main contractor receiving payment before they in turn receive their own payment.</p><p>  Therefore in the event of a sub-contractor failing to receive payment in the terms set out in the contract they will have the right to suspend work and, if the payment is disputed, to seek the matter to be resolved through adjudication.</p></reply>

Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract. </p><p>  My Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects (GN 2.3.1.3 Suitability Criteria for Works Contractors &#8211; Minimum Standards), published as part of the Capital Works Management Framework, which is available at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</font></i>.  In relation to pre-qualification criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.</p><p>  The level of reliable information available to contracting authorities is limited below the point where audited accounts are required to be submitted to the Companies Registration Office, currently this is only required for companies with a turnover in excess of &#8364;7.3 million.  However specific guidance on the financial appraisal of works contractors is currently being developed by my Department and will be available at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</font></i> when finalised.  The document is intended to provide advice to Contracting Authorities to ensure that appropriate information is sought from contractors who apply to take part in a competition for the award of a public works contract in order to assess their financial and economic standing.  The guidance will deal predominantly with the threat posed to a Contracting Authority by the insolvency of the main contractor and suggests the steps to be taken to manage the risk through appropriate measures taken in the procurement stage.</p><p>  Guidance already exists in GN 1.5 Public Works Contracts (Section 2.3 Bonds and Guarantees) on the steps that contracting authorities should take to minimise the risk to the taxpayer in the event of insolvency and is available at the same website.</p></reply>

The Bill proceeded through its second stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October 2012. I wish to advise the Deputy that officials in my Department are currently engaging with a wide range of stakeholders and other interested parties and I will be considering potential amendments which may be introduced at Committee Stage in the very near future. However, it is not possible for me to advise the Deputy as to the likely date for enactment of the Bill, as this depends on a number of factors which are outside my control, including the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.</p><p>  At the outset, let me say that the Bill will not change the basis of valuation for rating purposes. This will continue to be &#8220;net annual value&#8221; which is the hypothetical rental value of a property as assessed by reference to a specified date.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill amends several provisions contained in the Valuation Act 2001. These amendments include a number of technical changes to Part 5 of the 2001 Act which deals with how valuations, including revaluation of entire rating authority areas, are carried out. The Bill also proposes to amend Part 6, which deals with the carrying out of revisions of the rateable valuation of individual properties within rating authority areas between revaluations. In both instances, it is envisaged that the Commissioner of Valuation will appoint officers to carry out the tasks in question and the Bill makes specific provision for the appointment of &#8220;revision managers&#8221;. Section 6 of the Bill proposes to amend Section 19 of the Valuation Act 2001 by enabling the Commissioner to appoint persons to carry out the revaluation of entire rating authority areas. Such persons may be an officer of the Commissioner. However, provision is also made for the Commissioner to enter into an arrangement with a person or persons (other than officers of the Commissioner) to assist in the performance of the revaluation function. The effect of this provision is to enable the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. This is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot revaluation project which will utilise such external resources.</p><p>  Following enactment of the Bill, it is envisaged that revaluation projects can be conducted through <i>direct assessment</i> of the net annual value of properties, as heretofore. However, the Bill (Section 11, inserting a new Part 5A into the 2001 Act) also provides for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation using elements of <i>self-assessment</i> by ratepayers. This provision is also intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot project which will utilise self-assessment principles. Finally, I wish to draw the Deputy&#8217;s attention to Section 22 of the Bill which proposes to amend Section 48 of the 2001 Act by providing for the use of general market data or aggregated data (including <i>statistical and computer-aided techniques</i>  ) in determining valuations, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so.</p></reply>

In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my recent reply on this issue (PQ 3066/13 - answered 23/01/13).</p><p>  The proposal that all public procurement contracts include a requirement that the contractor must register apprentices in order to be able to carry out a public works contract poses a number of important considerations.  In the current economic climate, and in particular bearing in mind the difficulties in the construction sector, it is likely that, where a business is awarded a public contract, in particular a small scale contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business. In such circumstances a social clause requiring apprentices to be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford, or result in an existing employee being let go in favour of an apprentice. </p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting the long term and young unemployed either enter the labour market or be given appropriate opportunities to reskill. Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, my Department and the National Procurement Service are examining the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation and we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses that could include provisions relating to training opportunities in parts of the capital area in particular.</p></reply>

The Exchequer Statement also gives a breakdown of capital expenditure in January by Department. My Department does not hold information regarding capital expenditure at project level. Requests for information regarding expenditure on individual projects should be directed to the relevant spending Minister and his/her Departments.</p><p>  The capital expenditure budget for this year was set in Budget 2013 at &#8364;3.4 billion. Details regarding the breakdown of the capital budget by Department can be found in the Expenditure Report published by my Department in December 2012 (<font color="#0000FF"></font>  ).</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, how Departments spend their individual capital budgets throughout the year is dependent on what particular projects and programmes they will progress in that year. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed. For these reasons it would not be possible to either have a spread of even payments for projects throughout the year or to &#8220;frontload&#8221; capital expenditure as payments cannot be made in advance of work being completed.</p><p>  The profiling of monthly cash drawdown requirements from annual capital allocations is essentially an administrative exercise. For this reason employment and job creation are not factored into the exercise of profiling capital expenditure. However, they are taken into consideration by the Government when setting the annual capital allocations, alongside considerations regarding the overall budgetary position, strategic investment needs and the benefits that will flow from investment.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website   and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board (CIB), both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. </p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice. The independent financial advice is available to all mortgage holders in respect of a mortgage secured on a primary residence who have been offered long-term forbearance options by their lenders.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the Irish Banking Federation. To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are listed on a county by county basis on the website .</p><p>  Since its establishment, more than 2,400 people have contacted the Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline while there have been over 56,000 visits to    since June 2012. The number of borrowers who have availed of the independent financial advice service is not yet available.  The Central Bank of Ireland is engaging with lenders on the reporting requirements in relation to this new service and statistical information should be available at the end of quarter 1 this year.</p></reply>

I listened carefully to their views and proposals in relation to Budget 2013 and the issues affecting the people who use their services.</p><p>  In addition, the SVP is a member of the Department&rsquo;s Technical Advisory Group, which was established under the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016.  The group assists the Social Inclusion Division in the development and implementation of comprehensive data strategies and research to inform anti-poverty and social inclusion policies and practice and to facilitate improved monitoring of outcomes.  It identifies data sources, gaps and the most effective approaches to poverty measurement.  It advises on the on-going development of indicators and data to monitor poverty trends and targets. The group also promotes synergies, as appropriate, between its activities, those of its constituent bodies and the activities of other bodies in this area, including work undertaken at EU and international level.</p><p>  Finally, three SVP representatives are on the Department&rsquo;s general mailing list for notice of events and publications.  They are sent advance notices and invitations to attend conferences, seminars, workshops, consultative meetings etc.  </p><p>  I look forward to on-going engagement with the SVP, both on a Ministerial and Departmental level, in the year ahead.</p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provided for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.</p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  As part of the registration process, applicants are requested to provide documentation supporting the authentication of their identity.  This is most easily achieved through the presentation of secure photographic ID such as a passport, National Identity card, driver&rsquo;s licence etc.</p><p>  The process does take into account that some people will not have such documents.    In the main, these will be UK or Irish nationals as others will require a valid passport or National ID card to be present in the jurisdiction.  The process for applicants without photo ID will take slightly longer as it involves a more in-depth interview focussing on the verification of personal information available to the Department.</p><p>  The creation of a SAFE registration environment involves improving the technical connectivity, installing new equipment and training staff in these offices to support the registration process. The registration process is now live in over 40 DSP Offices with 87 SAFE Stations in production and some 475 staff have been trained.  Approximately 125,000 PSCs have been issued to date.</p><p>  The majority of these cards have been issued to new claimants for Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance and applicants for a new PPS number in Local Offices that have been equipped to carry out SAFE registrations. </p><p>  A small number of PSCs have also been issued through a reduced registration process using information already available to the State such as a passport application.  During 2013 this process will be extended to customers for whom a reduced process is appropriate.  With the range of registrations processes available, the number of PSCs to be produced from 2013 onwards will be significantly increased.</p></reply>

Schemes may apply for additional places in the normal way to their local Social Welfare Office.  This can be done at the project roll-over date.  The rationale and target group for the additional places should be detailed in the application submitted.  Projects that are in mid-term can also make a submission to the local office by completing an application for additional places with details of the added-value to jobseekers in the area and to the work of the scheme.  This process has already commenced nationally.</p><p>  The additional CE places can also be used to create a new scheme.  All proposals for new CE schemes should be sent to the local Community Services Unit of the Department setting out their project plan.  There is an opportunity here to encourage innovation, new approaches and models of delivery from organisations who are experienced in addressing the needs of long-term unemployed.

Their appropriate accommodation need, having regard to family size and circumstances, is deemed to be a 3 bedroomed house, many of which are available in this area at the required limit.  Despite being afforded ample time to find alternative accommodation, this family appears to have refused offers of 3 bedroomed houses from the local agent as their preference is for a 4 bedroomed house.</p><p>  Despite representations from my Department, the present landlord has refused to the reduce the rent for the family&rsquo;s present accommodation to the required limit for rent allowance, and on 8th January 2013 gave the family one month&rsquo;s notice to leave his property.  However, in an effort to facilitate this family as far as possible and prevent any possibility of homelessness, we have come to an arrangement with their landlord whereby if they find alternative accommodation at the required limit by March, my Department will pay the arrears due to the landlord for January and February.  We have been as flexible as we can be with this family, and given them ample time to resolve their accommodation difficulties.</p></reply>

The Government has provided over &euro;47 million for the scheme in 2013.  </p><p>  A review of the guidelines on exceptional needs payments was carried out by the Department by a working group made up of former community welfare service staff. One of the recommendations emanating from this review is to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, in relation to the payment of exceptional needs payments in respect of religious ceremonies, mainly Communions and Confirmations. </p><p>  For 2013, the Department has recommended that payment of the allowance specifically in respect of religious ceremonies will cease ensuring that the ENP scheme will continue to respond to specific need and not to the occasion.  This recommendation does not affect the discretion available to officers administering the scheme in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise. </p><p>The person concerned made an application on 16th   January, 2013 for an ENP in respect of a religious ceremony.   The application was refused and the person was advised that they may seek a review of this decision by another officer in the Department.   However, no such review has been sought to date.</p></reply>

This scheme was targeted at commercial salmon fishermen who were active in the fishery at the time and funding was provided to fishermen for them to leave the fishery and diversify into some new activity. </p><p>  The scheme was wound up in 2008 and all funds have been expended.  The Deputy will also appreciate that in the current financial circumstances there is no prospect of revisiting such a scheme.</p><p>  Conditions of the scheme included that nets had to be verifiably decommissioned to the satisfaction of the local Regional Fisheries Board and that no new licence would issue. </p><p>  This scheme was administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) and an independent appeals officer appointed for any applicant that was aggrieved by the decision of BIM. </p><p>  The scheme was introduced because of Ireland&rsquo;s requirement to comply with national and international legislation and obligations which meant a closure of the drift net fishery. </p><p>  There were approximately 67 fishermen in the Waterford estuary who chose not to avail of the scheme.  These fishermen had previously held public fishing licenses. </p><p>  I am advised that the Waterford estuary is currently below its conservation limit and therefore there is no permitted salmon fishery in the estuary. Any future decision on a fishery could only be taken in the context of the estuary being above its conservation limit and at that stage national and international legislation and other obligations would have to be considered. </p><p>  Salmon conservation limits are set similarly for all of Ireland&rsquo;s 142 salmon rivers.  The advice of the Standing Scientific Committee has regard to a range of considerations, principally, the size of the river (wetted area) and the latitude.</p><p>  Other factors specific to each river include the proportion of one sea winter salmon and multi sea winter salmon in the population, and the average weight of these salmon. </p><p>  Other inputs to calculating conservation limits nationally are proportions of male and female salmon and average numbers of eggs per female fish.  The number of eggs required to spawn a given area of river is calculated from index rivers and then used to calculate the egg requirement on all other rivers.</p><p>  The total egg requirement is then calculated for each specific river using the river&rsquo;s wetted area and latitude.  This total egg requirement is then calculated as total adult spawning salmon required (the conservation limit), split into a spawning requirement for one sea winter and multi sea winter salmon.</p><p>  I am advised that the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for salmon revised the conservation limits for all rivers for the 2013 scientific advice. </p><p>  New estimates of river wetted area were made in 2012 and the wetted area estimate of the River Barrow increased from 649 to 760 hectares.  However, the proportion of multi sea winter salmon designated for the Barrow increased to 39%.  Overall, these changes resulted in the salmon conservation limit of the Barrow reducing from 12,117 salmon in 2012 to 11,737 salmon from 2013 onwards. </p><p>  The SSC have advised that salmon conservation limits will not be revised for a period of five years.  The achievement of the salmon conservation limit on the Barrow has been assessed previously using declared rod catch up to 2006 when the river was open to angling. Since then, catchment wide-electrofishing has been used to assess the levels of juvenile salmon throughout the catchment. </p><p>  The SSC advice for 2013 was the Barrow is failing to meet its conservation limit but the river has been opened for catch and release angling in 2013 which will provide data on the strength of the salmon stock.</p><p>  Salmon conservation limits for the Suir and Nore are set on a similar basis to that of the Barrow but using the wetted area and latitude for the Suir and Nore specifically.</p><p>  The Waterford estuary has a number of rivers entering the sea in the same area.  Prior to any commercial fishing being permitted in the estuary area it will be necessary for all the waters in the vicinity of the fishing location to be in surplus at the same time and for genetic analysis to have confirmed that no other stocks are mixed in the area. </p><p>If genetic assessment proves that the stocks in the area are specific to local rivers only, and that analysis shows that these stocks are above their conservation limit with a surplus available for exploitation, consideration could be given to a commercial fishery.</p></reply>

Available surpluses (if any) of salmon are calculated for each individual river annually.</p><p>  The annual surplus of salmon available on the River Maine is divided between the commercial and recreational anglers.  I am advised by IFI that any extension (earlier opening) of the recreational angling season would need to be based on robust scientific analysis of available surplus, catch returns, counter information, run timing, exploitation rates etc.  With the majority of these parameters the time series of available data is considered by IFI to be too short to draw any meaningful scientific conclusions and therefore, in line with the conservation imperative, based on the precautionary principle, no recommendation can be made for an extension to the salmon angling season at this time.</p><p>  The independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for salmon provide advice on the criteria that should be evaluated when considering a proposal for an extension to the angling season in any salmon catchment.</p></reply>

In the years 2013-2015 this amounts to some &euro;254.4 million in capital investment funds to meet all capital requirements for my Department including areas such as energy efficiency and broadband schemes.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this level of available resources will require prioritisation in terms of specific allocations.</p><p>  Wave energy technology is still at the research, development and demonstration stage globally.  The Ocean Energy Development Unit (OEDU) in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is working to take forward Ireland&rsquo;s ocean energy programme, in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to realise the long term economic potential of Ireland&rsquo;s wave and tidal energy resources.  In that context SEAI is working closely with the Marine Institute and my Department as well as the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  SEAI is working in conjunction with ESBI, the Marine Institute and other stakeholders to establish a grid connected Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site Facility (AMETS) located off Annagh Head, west of Belmullet in County Mayo.  The test site will be a key enabler for the development of an ocean energy industry in Ireland.  An exploratory foreshore licence was granted to SEAI in September 2009, which enabled site investigation works to commence at the planned test site location.  A foreshore lease application was submitted in December 2011 and SEAI has been working with the Foreshore Unit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government &ndash; the application is currently in the final stages of consideration by the Foreshore Unit and it is expected that this will be concluded in the first half of 2013.  An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) carried out for the project has also been published.</p><p>  Developing the test site remains a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s Ocean Energy Strategy to ensure that Ireland is a competitive player in the European ocean energy arena and in December I granted consent to SEAI to purchase the site on which the substation for the Mayo test site is to be constructed.</p><p>Further developments at the site will be made within the context of the prioritisation of available resources as referred to at the outset of my reply taking full account of the Ocean Energy Strategy.  </p></reply>

Details of broadband services available on a County-by-County basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie  .</p><p>  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.</p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.</p><p>  In County Meath, NBS services are available within 18 of its 92 Electoral Divisions.  The area of Kilbride was excluded from the NBS as it was deemed, at the time of the comprehensive mapping exercise carried out prior to the launch of the Scheme, to be already served by at least one private operator.  Under EU State Aid rules, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to almost all applicants under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them, including applicants from County Meath.  In addition to consumer services, there are State-funded Metropolitan Area Networks in Navan, Dunboyne, Clonee, Dunsaughlin, Kells and Trim.  These networks provide high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the region.</p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  </p><p>  Specifically, it commits to: 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population; and A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.</p><p>  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention. </p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Kilbride and other rural areas in County Meath, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity. </p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.</p><p>Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must:</p><p>- have been involved in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) with their lender and agree that they can no longer afford to pay their mortgage loan now or in the future;</p><p>- own the property they live in, with a current market value of less than &euro;220,000 in the Dublin area or less than &euro;180 ,000 in the rest of the country;</p><p>- have their property in good condition, in a suitable location and which must suit their current needs ;</p><p>- not own any other property or have assets in excess of &euro;20,000;</p><p>- be eligible for social housing;</p><p>- have a long-term right to remain in Ireland.</p><p>At the end of 2012, 558 cases had been submitted by lenders. Of these, 289 were being processed, and 136 borrowers had been engaged with or were in the process of being engaged with by the lender. Sales had been agreed on 8 properties, with 2 of these having been completed. Full details of those availing of the Scheme by end 2012 on a county basis are set out in the table below.</p><p>The numbers of completed transactions is low but significant progress has been made. All of the main lenders and so called sub-prime lenders are fully engaged and have instituted the necessary internal processes. It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the timeframe of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall timeframe per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months. This compares favourably to the timeframes in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.</p><p>My Department has budgeted for the resolution of roughly 250 Mortgage-To-Rent transactions in 2013.</p><p>Breakdown of MTR applications at end 2012 by local authority:</p><p><table><tr><th>County </th><th>Submitted by Lender </th><th>Being Process </th><th>Engaging with Borrower </th><th>Social Housing Support </th><th>Valuation </th><th>Sale Agreed </th><th>Completed </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>16 </td><td>9 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>22 </td><td>4 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>15 </td><td>7 </td><td>4 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>14 </td><td>11 </td><td>6 </td><td>2 </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork County </td><td>43 </td><td>15 </td><td>6 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td>66 </td><td>42 </td><td>23 </td><td>5 </td><td>1 </td><td>3 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Dun Laoire </td><td>9 </td><td>5 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Fingal </td><td>40 </td><td>24 </td><td>16 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South </td><td>48 </td><td>31 </td><td>10 </td><td>3 </td><td>3 </td><td>3 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>15 </td><td>5 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County </td><td>27 </td><td>9 </td><td>3 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>13 </td><td>6 </td><td>3 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>34 </td><td>25 </td><td>13 </td><td>5 </td><td>2 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>15 </td><td>10 </td><td>7 </td><td>2 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>14 </td><td>5 </td><td>5 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City </td><td>16 </td><td>12 </td><td>6 </td><td>3 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County </td><td>20 </td><td>5 </td><td>3 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>9 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>32 </td><td>20 </td><td>13 </td><td>4 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>13 </td><td>5 </td><td>3 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>59 </td><td>37 </td><td>18 </td><td>4 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>8 </td><td>3 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>21 </td><td>11 </td><td>5 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>10 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>3 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North </td><td>16 </td><td>5 </td><td>3 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South </td><td>19 </td><td>6 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City </td><td>9 </td><td>3 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County </td><td>9 </td><td>6 </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>19 </td><td>12 </td><td>9 </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>30 </td><td>15 </td><td>7 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>21 </td><td>15 </td><td>4 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>708 </td><td>369 </td><td>182 </td><td>48 </td><td>25 </td><td>16 </td><td>8 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is not intended that domestic water charges will commence before 2014. The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Government has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme. </p><p>  The Water Services Bill 2013, consideration of which will continue in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this week, will assign the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme. The Bill also assigns to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) the power to advise the Government on the development of a regulatory framework for water services. The Government intends assigning to CER a full range of regulatory powers before the commencement of domestic water charges. This will include powers to set tariffs as well as the establishment of customer protection and dispute resolution measures. The framework for water charges will be developed, consulted on and approved by CER as part of the regulatory process.   </p><p>  Irish Water will be required to have a range of options in place to assist householders in paying their bills. For example, a wide range of flexible payment options is available for the other utility services and it is expected that these will be replicated for water services. </p></reply>

Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the domestic water metering programme and for the collection of water charges from households from 2014. </p><p>  The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation. The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them. </p><p>  As the metering programme will still be underway in 2014, an appropriate approach to charging customers who are not metered at that stage will be put in place. This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it represents a reasonable proxy for usage and is fair. The approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties will be included in a public consultation taking place this year as part of the regulatory process. </p><p>My Department estimates that up to 300,000 households may not be metered in the initial metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty of doing so. Where conventional meter installation is not possible, it is intended that alternative approaches will be considered. For example, for housing units in apartment complexes, internal metering may be considered.   </p></reply>

This exemption applies where the house has not been extended previously, and the floor area of any such extension does not exceed 40 square metres. The exemption is subject to compliance with a number of other conditions and limitations. </p><p>  There is a balance, in providing for exemptions from planning permission, between streamlining the consent process for minor works and supporting proper planning and sustainable development, including the need to ensure adequate third party participation rights. While all aspects of the existing regime for exempted development are kept under on-going monitoring and review, I have no plans to amend this exemption at this time. </p></reply>

These schemes cover works reasonably necessary for the purposes of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation of applicants, and can in those circumstances include the removal of asbestos.</p><p>  The schemes are administered by local authorities and it is a matter for each local authority to determine how the funding is apportioned between the various grant measures and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within the capital allocations provided by my Department. </p><p>  It is recommended that expert advice should be sought in dealing with asbestos materials and if removal is necessary it should only be done by a competent contractor with the required training.   </p></reply>

Written and on-line registration facilities , with a variety of payment options, have been available since 26 June 2012 and have been comprehensively publicised. I consider that ample time has been provided to householders to comply with the legal obligation to register and I have no plans to extend the registration period.      </p><p>  On 17 December 2012 I announced my intention to introduce a grant scheme to provide financial assistance to households whose septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems are deemed to require remediation following an inspection under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012. Full details of the scheme will be defined in   regulations which I will make in advance of inspections commencing later this year.    Inspections will be carried out by appropriately qualified local authority staff who will be appointed as inspectors by the EPA . A training course for inspectors is currently being finalised and it will be extended to all local authorities in the coming weeks. Inspections will commence later this year and householders will be notified by their local authority in writing if their system is to be inspected.   </p><p>  Where a domestic wastewater treatment system is found to be a risk to human health or the environment and remediation works are required, the selection of a contractor to carry out the works required , and agreement to the cost of those works, will be a matter for the householder concerned. Due   to the variety of remediation works which could arise, and the number of trades and professions which could be involved, I have no plans to establish a registration system for contractors involved in remediation works. </p></reply>

To that end, Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations 2011, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document L, requires that all new housing, including social housing: has 60% lower heat energy demand than a similar house built to 2005 standards; requires the installation of boilers with a minimum seasonal efficiency of not less than 9 0 % (   condensing boilers); requires the mandatory use of renewable energy sources (a minimum of 10 kilowatt hours per square metre per annum).</p><p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their existing social housing stock.

While the objective is to improve the general standard of a local authority house and increase the Building Energy Rating (BER) to as high a level as possible, with C1 being the target figure, it may not be practicable to bring every dwelling to this standard, especially in the case of older stock. Exchequer grants are not payable in respect of the achievement of G or F ratings.   </p></reply>

The key legislative codes in that regard are the   Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 and the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2011; in particular, section 32 of the 1996 Act places the responsibility on the holders of waste to ensure that it is managed in a manner that does not cause environmental pollution. </p><p>  Penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.   A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.      </p><p>  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial. Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.     </p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place , my Department is preparing legislative proposals t hat would provide for the introduction of on-the-s pot fines for incidences of fly-tipping or small- scale illegal dumping. I expect to b e in a position to submit proposed Heads of a Bill in this regard to Government for approval by the end of the first quarter of this year.   </p><p>  The taking of enforcement action in relation to any particular incident of littering or illegal dumping is a matter for the relevant local authority concerned and also the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement which supervises the environmental protection activities of local authorities. While having no operational role in these matters, my Department provides funding to support the activities of a network of local authority environmental enforcement officers. Each local authority sets out an annual programme of action, detailing the enforcement activities towards which this funding will be utilised. Typically, such programmes also include actions to tackle illegal dumping. I expect to be in a position to finalise 2013 funding allocations for this purpose in the coming weeks, in the context of finalising the overall allocations from the Environment Fund.      </p><p>  My Department also provides funding for an Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme.  Once the 2013 Environment Fund allocations are finalised, local authorities will be invited to apply for grant aid for projects which meet the criteria governing the scheme. </p></reply>

However, the Burtonport Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.  </p><p>The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Donegal County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities.  Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.</p><p>  Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &ndash; 2013, was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.

I would expect  that the JPCs should continue to provide a forum for the development of various types of local partnerships to enhance community safety and the quality of life generally.</p></reply>

The survivors and the families of those killed and injured have borne the grief of those tragic events and the memory of their loved ones lives on with them.</p><p>  As the House is aware, the late Judge Henry Barron carried out a detailed and painstaking inquiry into those awful events of May 1974 and, indeed, other tragic atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which so many innocent people lost their lives.</p><p>  As the Deputy will recall this House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann have previously and unanimously urged the British Government to allow access to documents relevant to these events.  I know that many Deputies in this House have raised this issue directly with our counterparts at Westminster and that they will continue to do so.  For its part, since this Government took office, the Taoiseach has raised the issue with the British Prime Minister and the T&aacute;naiste has also raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Garda authorities that the deployment of Garda transport is determined on the basis of ongoing analysis and review of the policing needs of each Garda Division, including the Donegal Division, to ensure that the available resources are utilised to best advantage to meet the operational requirements of the Force.  Garda patrol vehicles are taken out of service for a variety of reasons, including as a result of accidents or when the odometer reading reaches the safety limit set by the relevant manufacturer. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I made an additional &euro;3 million available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year, enabling the Force to procure a total of 312 vehicles in 2012.  In this context I understand that 25 new vehicles are currently being provided for the Garda Northern Region, which includes the Donegal Division.  A more specific breakdown is not currently available but the Deputy can be assured that the vehicles will be deployed as effectively as possible in line with operational circumstances.</p><p>  In addition, a further allocation of &euro;5 million has been provided for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in 2013.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to provide an effective and efficient policing service.</p></reply>

As of 11 February 2013, there are 4,735 residents in 35 accommodation centres contracted to RIA throughout the State.</p><p>The following profile shows the duration of stay of residents currently in direct provision accommodation centres.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Months Currently in Direct Provision</div></th><th><div>Number of residents*</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>0-3</div></td><td><div>223</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>3-6</div></td><td><div>210</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>6-9</div></td><td><div>213</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>9-12</div></td><td><div>235</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>12-18</div></td><td><div>304</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>18-24</div></td><td><div>221</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>24-36</div></td><td><div>496</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>36+</div></td><td><div>2,833</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>4,735</div></td></tr></table></p><p>(*This profile is based on residents' most recent entry to the direct provision system.  It does not include past time spent by residents who left the system for a period and subsequently sought and were granted re-access to the system.)</p><p>I acknowledge that the length of time spent in the direct provision system is an issue to be addressed. On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</p><p>For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.</p><p>I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010 which I intend to republish provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.</p><p>Further, I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist INIS  in processing a cohort of repatriation cases, thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system. I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months.</p><p>As to the system of direct provision itself, I have explained in detail in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions the reasons why it was introduced in 1999 in response to a situation where the structures then in place were entirely unsuited to the situation then pertaining and was necessary to prevent widespread homelessness among asylum seekers.The system remains a necessary feature of the State's asylum and immigration system and, as explained above, my efforts are concentrated on reducing the length of time persons stay in centres.</p><p>There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website -  www.ria.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Ireland's ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption in 2011, following the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption Act 2010, signalled Ireland's commitment to the international effort in this regard.</p><p>  The Convention provides a comprehensive set of standards that all countries can apply in order to strengthen their legal and regulatory regimes to fight corruption. The Convention also calls for preventative measures and the criminalisation of the most prevalent forms of corruption in both public and private sectors.  Article 6 of the Convention, to which the Deputy refers, requires that each State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, ensure the existence of a body or bodies that prevent corruption. The Convention does not mandate the creation or maintenance of a body. The Convention recognises that, given the range of responsibilities and functions to be undertaken, it may be that this task is assigned to different existing agencies.</p><p>  In applying Article 6 to the domestic situation it is clear that there is a broad spectrum of legislation which has relevance for the prevention of corruption including the Prevention of Corruption Acts, ethics  legislation, political funding legislation, money laundering legislation, the Companies Acts etc.  Ireland's obligations under Article 6 are consequently addressed by a range of bodies including the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Companies Registration Office, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The development and implementation of anti-corruption policies, as required by the Convention, does not therefore rest with any one body in this jurisdiction.</p></reply>

There is no legal provision to allow for a reduction in a person's social welfare payments on the basis that he/she has been granted a Criminal Legal Aid Certificate.  Any proposal to recoup criminal legal aid by reducing a person's social welfare payments would need careful consideration as a person's right to be legally represented in respect of criminal charges, if necessary at the expense of the State, is constitutionally protected.  The Deputy will appreciate my overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that criminal legal aid is granted by the courts.  Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in the performance of its functions.  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that their Criminal Case Tracking System (CCTS) contains a record of legal aid granted by the District Court.  The records, however, are not kept in a manner which would allow for the extraction of information showing the number of times a person has been granted criminal legal aid.</p><p>  In October 2011 the Legal Aid Board commenced administering the ad hoc Garda Station Legal Advice Scheme which covers the provision of free legal advice to persons detained in respect of certain offences under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939, section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.   The Board is recording detailed data, including the number of persons availing of the scheme.  Their data show that from October 2011, a total of 666 persons have accessed the scheme on two or more occasions.  New legislation currently being drafted will assign responsibility to the Board for administration of the entire legal aid scheme which will facilitate, inter alia, the collection of data.  The information sought in relation to the range of offences covered is also not readily available from the system but I will arrange for the information to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p></reply>

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid and the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  The court may require the applicant to furnish a statement of his/her means.  The granting or refusal of criminal legal aid is a matter determined by the judiciary.</p><p>  Total expenditure on Criminal Legal Aid for 2012 came to &#8364;50.5 million, a reduction of 10% over 2011.  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &#8364;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.  The reductions follow savings measures I have introduced since coming into office including cuts to fees during 2011.  Other measures are being introduced with a view to speeding up criminal cases, cutting down on adjournments etc.  I am also considering, in the context of legislation currently being drafted, measures to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board. The Bill is likely to include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid in certain circumstances or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.</p><p>  These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325</i> effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. </i>   As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  Therefore, I have no plans at present to restrict the number of times a person can apply for legal aid.</p><p>  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that, while every effort is being made to contain costs, my overriding concern must be to ensure that any person charged with a criminal offence cannot evade trial.  Drafting of the legislation, which includes the transfer of administration to the Legal Aid Board, has not progressed to date due to other legislative priorities in my own Department and the Attorney General's Office but I hope to publish the Bill later this year.</p></reply>

The R District encompasses the Coolock, Swords and Malahide Sub-districts. There is a dedicated warrants unit in the R District to manage and execute warrants. This unit is assisted by uniform and plain clothes units who also execute warrants.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continually liaise with other agencies, including Government Departments, to locate individuals sought on warrant resulting in addresses other than those provided on the warrants being obtained.  Warrants personnel also regularly liaise with the Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service to ensure that timely exchange of relevant information regarding persons sought for the service of Warrants.  There can be a multiplicity of reasons why warrants can take time to execute and, in some cases, they can prove ultimately unenforceable, as the subjects of the warrants will often take every step open to them to try to avoid arrest through moving from address to address, leaving the country and so on.</p><p>I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that at present there is an Inspector in each Garda District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and each Division outside the DMR tasked with managing the execution of warrants, and other issues relating to them. In addition, specific members of the Force are tasked with their execution. While it is clearly important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take all possible action to ensure that warrants are executed as quickly as possible, it should be borne in mind that the vast majority of warrants do not relate to violent or the more serious categories of offence.  In this regard, I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na give priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime and will continue to do so.  I am also advised that there is a warrants working group in place which facilitates liaison between the various stakeholders, including the Court Service and the Prison Service and which works to identify, address and prevent difficulties in the warrants process. The work of the group is ongoing and relevant recommendations for the improvement of systems are being implemented on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Of its nature, the figure for outstanding warrants recorded by PULSE at any given time reflects an accumulation of old warrants which has arisen over the years and I have been concerned that the total figure for outstanding warrants as shown on PULSE may not be a reliable indicator of the number of 'live' warrants which are enforceable which are on hand. In this regard, I have asked the Commissioner to consider whether there may be a better way of maintaining statistics which gives a more realistic indication in relation to any backlog of warrants.</p><p>There seems little doubt that the outstanding warrants figures for previous years reflected partly the situation which then obtained in relation to the use of imprisonment in cases of non-payment of fines, a practice which I think most people now regard as highly undesirable. Since the commencement of section 14 of the Fines Act 2010, a Court is now obliged to take into account the means of the person before imposing a fine. This measure combined with other provisions such as the use of community service, payment by instalment and use of attachment of earnings should, when fully operational, have very beneficial effects on the number of warrants which the Garda&iacute; are called on to enforce.  I am in ongoing contact with the Commissioner on this matter and he has assured me that both he and his senior management team are closely monitoring the situation with a view to ensuring that warrants are executed as expeditiously as possible. I expect to receive a further report from the Garda authorities on the matter in the coming months.</p></reply>

The corresponding figures for 2012 amounted to 13,504 and 3,911 respectively.  The Visa Office in Moscow accepts applications from residents of the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.  The Irish embassy in Ankara accepts applications from residents of Turkey and Azerbaijan.  It is not possible to disaggregrate the number of visas in respect of Russian and Turkish nationals from the overall figures without a disproportionate amount of effort.  The grant rate for applications from both countries was 97%  in each of the years in question.</p><p>  The majority of visa applications from Russia and Turkey are for Short Stay Visas for the purpose of tourism, family visits or business.  The Deputy may be aware that since 1 July, 2011 visitors from Russia and Turkey who are in possession of a UK visa and who have passed UK immigration control have been able to avail of a Visa Waiver Programme which means that they do not also require an Irish visa to travel to Ireland.  Notwithstanding this concession, the number of applications from Russia and Turkey has grown in the period since the introduction of the Visa Waiver Programme, and trips from all of the countries covered by the Programme increased by 21% in the twelve months following its introduction.  These are good indications of the success of promotional initiatives such as the Visa Waiver Programme in raising awareness of Ireland as a tourist and business destination.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that INIS, in partnership with Marketing English in Ireland (MEI), the representative body for English language schools, has recently commenced pilot programmes in Turkey to attract English language students to Ireland. These will mainly be second level students coming to Ireland for short stays, together with third level students and executive level employees who may come for either short or medium stays in order to further their knowledge of the English language.</p></reply>

The Garda Commissioner has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country. <font color="#000080">  </font>The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will continue to be provided to our communities.   The Garda Commissioner has also advised that closure of stations will result in some additional 61,000 patrolling hours being available for operational policing.</p><p>  In addition, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has recently acquired a number of vehicles which are being converted into mobile Garda offices and it is planned that they will be assigned to areas where Garda stations have been closed to ensure that members of the public can continue to conduct their business and interact with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  Garda&iacute; work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch. Neither I as Minister nor the Government will shirk in our responsibility to do everything we can to maintain the strong Garda connection with the Community and to ensure that to the maximum extent possible resources will continue to be made available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am confident that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to provide a professional policing service right across the country in a manner that is effective and is consistent with the highest standards for which the Force is renowned.</p></reply>

Barristers are not regulated by similar legislation but under the aegis of the Bar Council.  Under Section 2 of the Code of Conduct for the Bar a barrister has an overriding duty to the court to ensure in the public interest that the proper and efficient administration of justice is achieved and he/she must assist the court in the administration of justice and must not deceive or knowingly mislead the court.</p><p>  Under Section 5 of the Guide to Professional Conduct of Solicitors &lsquo;a   solicitor not only acts for his client and owes a duty to do his best for that client but he also owes a duty to the court.  The proper administration of justice requires that the court be able to rely upon each lawyer who appears before it or who has dealings with it.  A solicitor:</p><p> (a) should promote and protect fearlessly by all proper and lawful means the client&rsquo;s best interests and do so without regard to his own interest or to any consequences to himself or to any person,</p><p> (b) should keep confidential information about a client and his or her affairs and must not disclose the facts known to him regarding the client&rsquo;s character or previous convictions without the client&rsquo;s express consent,</p><p> (c) has an overriding duty to the court to ensure in the public interest that the proper and efficient administration of justice is achieved and should assist the court in the administration of justice and should not deceive or knowingly or recklessly mislead the court&rsquo;.</p><p>  Both of the professional conduct regimes are to be modernised and reformed under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 which is awaiting Committee Stage. To that end, the Bill has three important levers of reform in relation to the regulation of the two legal professions and of legal costs, namely:</p><p> - a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers.</p><p> - an independent complaints system to deal with public complaints including those relating to professional misconduct. There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions.</p><p> - an Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will assume the role of the existing Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated and two new Taxing-Masters have already been appointed in anticipation of this reform.  Determinations of costs made by the Adjudicator will be made public and the Adjudicator may also publish legal costs guidelines. Separately, the Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a set of Legal Costs Principles.  It also imposes greater obligations on legal practitioners to disclose the actual or potential costs of legal proceedings to their clients.</p></reply>

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on District, Divisional and Regional levels to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service continues to be provided to the public.</p><p>  With regard to the policing arrangements for the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division, I am advised by the Garda authorities that local Garda management recently carried out an overall review of policing structures within the Division in order to ensure the continued delivery of a full and comprehensive policing service to the community and to ensure the most efficient use of available resources.  Following this review, the Garda authorities have determined that the Detective Branch in the Cavan/Monaghan Division, which has recently received additional personnel, will take a lead role in the enforcement of drug related legislation.  This will be achieved through intelligence led policing and the undertaking of targeted operations against those involved in drug trafficking. This will ensure that this important aspect of policing remains a priority within the Division and local Garda management are satisfied that this is the most appropriate resource strategy to be adapted in this regard.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that tackling the illegal drug trade remains a key priority for this Government and for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as reflected in the strategic actions outlined in the National Drug Strategy and the policing priorites of An Garda S&iacute;&oacute;ch&aacute;na.

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The Deputy may wish to note that in order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda vetting, the standard procedure is that all applications from no matter what organisation are processed in chronological order from their date of receipt. Accordingly, there is no specific protocol in place for the management of vetting applications pertaining to potential staff members of health care facilities.</p><p>  The information requested by the Deputy would require the diversion of staff resources which could not be justified in the context of the necessity to address the existing case load of vetting applications.  Notwithstanding that, the average processing time for vetting procedures is currently 8 to10 weeks. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. All organisations are aware of the processing time frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection processes.</p><p>  It is my objective that processing times should be kept to a minimum, while maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system. In that regard, following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I am pleased to announce that sanction has been granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Garda Central Vetting Unit in the near future.</p></reply>

They are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives, which seek to provide focussed and effective interventions to young people coming to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are at risk of or who have become involved in offending behaviour. They operate as a support to the Garda Diversion Programme and the network of Juvenile Liaison Officers across the country.  The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &quot;at risk&quot; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of them remaining within the justice system. The projects also operate measures under the European Social Fund 2007 - 2013 part-funded Human Capital Investment Programme with the specific purpose of increasing the capacity of project participants to find employment.</p><p>Projects operate through a local project committee structure, chaired by the local District Officer. Projects are delivered under the terms of a Funding Agreement between my Department and the Community Based Organisation managing the projects.

In this regard, when the people concerned were located by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a spokesman on their behalf alleged that they had been the subject of poor working conditions while on board the vessel concerned and that they had not been paid by the owners of the vessel for work done.  The spokesman made it clear that they would not return to the vessel and that they wished to return to their country of origin.  The spokesman indicated that they wished to make contact with their embassy.  They made no request to contact any other body or agency.  Contact was made by the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) at Dublin with a view to determining the appropriate course to be taken.  The GNIB in turn contacted officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  The request to make contact with Consular officials at their Embassy in London, was facilitated and INIS made inquiries with a view to sourcing accommodation for the people concerned, which resulted in accommodation being provided at no cost to them until they were repatriated.</p><p>  Neither INIS nor An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware of any proceedings being initiated over the 11 days during which the vessel was at port, which would have prevented the vessel from leaving this jurisdiction and there is no provision in immigration related legislation which could have given rise to such a situation.  The issue of the alleged dispute regarding conditions and payment of wages is not a matter for my Department or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am informed that the in relation to the issue of payment of wages to the crew onboard fishing vessels that this is the responsibility of the flag state, which in this case is the United Kingdom.  However, if the people concerned are required to return to Ireland in connection with the alleged dispute, it is open to them to seek an Irish entry visa for that purpose.  I can inform the Deputy that all the people concerned have now travelled back safely to their country of origin.</p></reply>

It is important to remember that while these Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis.  The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Garda web site.  The delivery of the most effective policing service possible to the public remains a core objective of the Commissioner and he will continue to have my full support in seeking to maximise the number of garda&iacute; on active frontline duty, preventing and detecting crime right across the country.</p></reply>

In preparing my proposals for legislation, I am considering the detailed recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its Report on the Legal Aspects of Family Relationships<font color="#000080">.</font>  The Commission recommends that legislative provisions be introduced to facilitate the extension of guardianship (parental responsibility) to civil partners and step-parents either by agreement with the other parties who have parental responsibility for the child or by application to court.  In that context, I am considering the Commission's specific recommendations on legislative reform, which would put same-sex couples and step-parents on an equal footing with other couples in relation to their children.  I am also reviewing existing legislation worldwide addressing the issues of parentage, assisted human reproduction and surrogacy and considering the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction published by the Department of Health in 2005.  Those reforms must ensure that children in lesbian or gay family units are able to form a legal connection with their non-biological parent and that kindred relationships flow from such legal connection.  In particular, reform of the law is needed in the areas of guardianship, custody and access, and to ensure maintenance and inheritance rights for the children of civil partners.</p></reply>

"Specified information" is information other than a court determined criminal record.  For example, "specified information" includes conclusions from investigations of child abuse or neglect that have been conducted by the HSE, where such investigations have concluded that a person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons.  The procedures set out in the Act are designed to ensure that the human rights of the person being vetted are adequately protected.  It is important to note that before specified information can be disclosed, the person who is the subject of the information must be given a copy of that information and must be given the opportunity to challenge the proposed disclosure.  The Act also provides that a disclosure of such information will only occur where there is a bona-fide concern that the person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons, and the information has been assessed for its reliability and relevance, and the disclosure is in accordance with principles of natural justice.</p><p>  The Act provides for the appointment of an independent Appeals Officer who will be responsible for assessing and deciding appeals against the proposed disclosure of specified information.  A party to an appeal can also appeal a determination of an appeal by an appeals officer to the High Court, on a point of law.  By confining the information that can be disclosed to information arising from criminal investigations or statutory inquiries, and by ensuring that individuals who are the subject of such information have their right to defend their name protected in the Act, the Act seeks to ensure that information such as vague rumours, or innuendo or false allegations cannot form any part of the vetting process.  The Act also seeks to ensure that the constitutional right of all citizens to protect their good name, as provided in Article 40.3.2 of the constitution, is fully protected.</p></reply>

Surrender was refused in the High Court on the basis that the person concerned had not fled the state in question, which was a requirement of the European Arrest Warrant Act at that time.  The decision of the High Court was appealed to the Supreme Court which affirmed the original decision to refuse surrender.  Legislation was subsequently amended to remove the 'fled' requirement in respect of persons sought to serve a sentence in the issuing state.  This amendment brought the Act into closer compliance with the relevant EU Framework Decision which referred to 'fleeing' in the Recital but did not include the term in the relevant Article.  After the legislation was changed, the Hungarian authorities submitted a new warrant.  The High Court ordered the surrender of the person concerned and that Order was appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court upheld the appeal and refused to surrender the person.  As the Deputy will be aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their functions.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to make any further comment in the matter other than to say that there are no further EAW proceedings pending in this jurisdiction.</p></reply>

It is expected that Government approval for the required legislation will be sought later this year. It is envisaged that a Bill will be published in 2014.  Under an existing 1983 Council of Europe Convention, to which Ireland is party, individuals convicted of an offence in another Convention state, and for which he or she has received a custodial sentence, may be transferred to their home state to serve that sentence.  The Framework Decision seeks to extend the circumstances in which a person may serve a custodial sentence, imposed in another EU state, in their home state.</p><p>  Whereas the 1983 Convention provides for the physical transfer of the person from the sentencing state to their home state, the Framework Decision, <i>inter alia</i>  , permits the transfer of the sentence where the person subject to that sentence is in either the issuing state or the state being asked to execute the sentence.  Moreover, the consent of the sentenced person will not be required where the request for execution of the sentence is sent to that person's state of nationality.  However, there is a restriction on the application of the Framework Decision insofar as it applies to Ireland.  Under article 28.2 of the instrument, a member state may make a declaration that existing arrangements will continue to apply in relation to judgements delivered prior to 5 December 2011.  Ireland has made such a declaration.</p></reply>

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to reduce legal costs in this country by way of increasing our competitiveness, both sectorally and nationally.</p><p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill makes extensive provision, particularly in Part 9, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles.  These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication.  These cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors.  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business.  It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.  Legal practitioners will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in Section 90 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.</p><p>  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &#8211; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines.  It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs.  Two new Taxing-Masters have been appointed by public competition under the enhanced qualification criteria of Part 14 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 to prepare the way for these modernisation measures.</p><p>  Taking account of developments and the pressures being experienced by legal practitioners in other open common law jurisdictions the Bill seeks to address the danger of Irish law firms and legal practitioners operating at a cost disadvantage.  Several types of new alternative business structure models have been, or continue to be, rolled-out in England and Wales, Scotland, Australia, Germany, Netherlands and parts of Canada in direct competition with Irish legal service providers - for example, solicitors, accountants and insurers practising as one business or &quot;multi-disciplinary practice&quot; providing their complementary services in a pooled and more cost-effective setting.  In other provisions the Bill lifts existing restrictions on direct professional access to a barrister and on barristers who share premises or costs from advertising themselves as such a group.  The Bill also allows that a barrister in employment may provide legal services for his or her employer.  The Bill, therefore, contains numerous measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services to more responsive and more competitive legal service models building on the enormous advances that have been made in supporting business technologies.  Through its extensive legal costs transparency provisions and its provision for modern and more competitive business alternatives, the Legal Services Regulation Bill is providing an opportunity to ameliorate the cost to business and other consumers of legal services while also creating new business opportunities for the legal services sector.  I am confident that this concerted approach to reducing legal costs will be of lasting benefit to all consumers of legal services and contribute to our early national economic recovery.</p></reply>

The Firearms Acts are kept under review in the interests of public safety and law enforcement.

The average processing time for vetting procedures is currently 8 to 10 weeks.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations are aware of the processing time frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection processes.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Garda vetting certificates are issued to specified organisations registered with GCVU for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  I should emphasise that the certificate is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Each time a new vetting application is received, new and full vetting checks are conducted.  This is to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  Accordingly the processing time remains the same whether for new applications or cases where previous vetting has occurred.  The Deputy may wish to note that in order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda vetting, the standard procedure is that all applications are processed in chronological order from their date of receipt.  It is my objective that processing times should be kept to a minimum, while maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>In that regard, following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I am pleased to announce that sanction has been granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Garda Central Vetting Unit in the near future.</p></reply>

The Authority is an independent statutory agency under the aegis of my Department.  A register of licensed contractors and individuals is available on the Authority&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  In regard to the regulation and licensing of the private security industry by the Authority, I am informed that the vetting of applicants is an integral part of the licensing process as provided for in the relevant legislation.  In the case of contractor licensing, all directors of a company, the partners in a partnership, all sole traders and any shareholder in a company with a shareholding of 20% or more are vetted, on the Authority's behalf, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All applicants for individual licences also go through the vetting process.  The Private Security Services Acts do not provide for debt collectors or bailiffs.  Moreover, as these activities do not fall under the aegis of my Department I have no responsibility to the D&aacute;il for these matters.</p><p>  The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland which employ personnel to work in a full time part time, voluntary or student capacity with children and or vulnerable adults. Criminal history vetting for general employment purposes including debt collectors is not available on demand.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the training component of the mission will be made up of approximately 250 personnel, and this will be further supplemented by additional troops who will be deployed to provide force protection.  The Council has tasked the Mission Commander, General Fran&ccedil;ois Lecointre, with preparations for the early launch of the mission.

Prior to this any surveying for the disease had yielded negative results. Following the finding a major survey was initiated by the Department part of which was a winter survey of all ash plantations of imported stock planted during 2009 &#8211; 2012. This exercise has now been completed.    The plantation survey is ongoing and is now looking at a larger timeframe of plantings. </p><p>  Well over 100 samples were sent for analysis from the winter plantation survey. In total there are currently 26 forestry plantations with imported ash that have tested positive; with trace-forward of the associated trees in the batches this represents over 120 sites. In addition a member of the public reported a suspected garden ash tree and this also tested positive. A further occurrence has been confirmed on ash growing on the surrounds of a farm.  Department officials are also surveying forestry and horticultural nurseries, motorways as well as farm plantings.  There have been positive samples in 14 separate horticultural nurseries and 1 garden centre. In relation to the motorways I can report that 3 sites have been identified as having the disease. </p><p>The Department&#8217;s forestry officials are working with the forestry contractors and the owners to remove the ash trees on these 120-  plus sites, under a reconstitution scheme. This scheme is being put in place and its terms and conditions will be available shortly.  An individual Sanitation Action Plan will be put in place for each of the sites affected. This will set out in detail the procedures to be followed at the specified site. It will cover actions such as disposal of infected material and proper hygiene measures etc. </p><p>On 26 October legal measures were also introduced to prohibit the importation into Ireland of plant material from ash dieback infected areas.  These measures, introduced by Ministerial Order, took effect immediately. Ireland imported over 200,000 ash plants in 2011.</p><p>On 6   November legislation was introduced to restrict the movement of ash wood into the country (in addition to plant material).  The legislation allows ash wood movement into Ireland if the wood is; (1) accompanied by a plant passport certifying that it comes from an area free of the disease or; (2) free of outer round surface (no passport required) or; (3) kiln dried below 20% moisture (no passport required). </p><p>The legal measures were introduced in conjunction with similar measures taken by Northern Ireland authorities.    </p><p>Before the legislation was introduced Department officials notified the European Commission and the other Member States of the first finding of <i>Chalara fraxinea</i> in Ireland and the actions taken to destroy the material and its intention to take emergency measures under the EU Plant Health Directive to prevent the further introduction of <i>Chalara fraxinea.</i></p><p>  Department officials continue to work closely with their colleagues in Northern Ireland and Great Britain to ensure that all the appropriate measures are taken to tackle this disease.  This work includes the production of a joint North/South Control Strategy for the disease and a UK and Ireland Pest Risk Analysis.</p></reply>

This is within the remit of my colleague Minister Bruton and work is underway in his Department on including an enabling provision in legislation which is currently being drafted to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which would allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice.   The intention of such a statutory Code is not to protect one stakeholder over another or to prevent stakeholders from engaging in robust contractual negotiations or to determine the price of grocery goods. Rather the essential value of the Code is that by regulating problematic practices in the grocery goods sector such a Code seeks to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the various stakeholders including the interests of the end user, the consumer. </p><p>  At EU level some progress has been made through the High Level Forum on the better functioning of the food supply chain.  Stakeholders have agreed on a list of general and specific principles of good practice in commercial relations but so far have not agreed on implementing arrangements or whether there should be a statutory provision. The Commission has extended the term of the Forum to facilitate agreement.</p></reply>

The latter regulation, came into effect on 1 July 2009, provides that equine animals registered after that date<b></b>  must be identified with a passport and a microchip. </p><p>The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31 December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain. S.I. No 357 of 2011 was amended in September 2012 by S.I. 371 of 2012 in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport.</p><p>My Department introduced enhanced<b></b>legislation and<b></b>  procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises such that, from 1 May 2012, anyone who is the owner/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with my Department.  Keepers seeking to register equines are required to have a herd number registered with my Department and to keep records of movements on/off their premises.</p><p>  My Department also introduced enhanced procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs in October 2011 and communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators. These procedures provide that an official veterinarian must be present in a meat plant when slaughtering is taking place. All animals are subject to an antemortem inspection, which includes an identification check, by an official veterinarian prior to slaughter. Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain. </p><p>  My Department is developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from Passport Issuing Organisations to the Department and may include information from records obtained at slaughter plants, knackeries, sales and live exports.  The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter. </p><p>  As indicated above, the legislative basis for the identification of equines resides in EU legislation, as transposed into Irish legislation, and it is not open to me unilaterally to apply the EU provisions relating to the identification of bovines to the equidae sector. Apart from this, not all components of the cattle system would be appropriate for equines, not least the requirement to use tags in both ears. However, I will continue to review existing legislation to establish if a need exists to bring forward further provisions to strengthen the traceability system for horses.</p></reply>

The Pigmeat Recall Scheme (PRS), which was approved by the European Commission, provided for a facility of up to &euro;180 million from the public finances to assist processors in funding the recall and destruction of certain pork products. The objective of and rationale for the PRS was to ensure the survival of the pigmeat sector at a time of immediate crisis. It was not intended to compensate for all third party losses incurred at that time. It was, and is, a matter for the Irish pigmeat processing sector to settle and resolve other losses incurred with its customers as considered necessary.</p><p>  The ex-gratia aid paid as a contribution towards the costs incurred by processors as a result of the recall was subject to State Aid approval as well as the provision of adequate supporting documentary evidence and without any admission of liability whatsoever by the State.</p><p>  With regard to the operation of the PRS, product in Ireland was destroyed in one of four category 1 rendering plants.  Product in overseas markets was either destroyed overseas or returned to Ireland for destruction. Approximately &euro;102 million was eventually paid to processors for product destroyed in Ireland and in overseas markets. </p><p>  Product exported by Irish primary processors and destroyed under the terms of the scheme was valued at the wholesale market price and paid on that basis. Valuations could not exceed the wholesale market price for the product as recorded and verified by the processor, and had to be net of VAT and any discounts applied. Copies of invoices had to be submitted with claims. Where identical products were marketed and priced at differing values, a weighted average value was calculated and used for all such products.  </p><p>  Some 211,365 kg of Irish products, valued at &euro;440,060, was destroyed in Russia, while 1,157,258 kg of Irish products valued at &euro;2,530,402 was returned from Russia to Ireland for destruction. My Department also processed associated costs claims from processors totalling &euro;954,856 to cover transport to destruction, overseas storage and destruction costs and non-refundable import duties in Russia. These claims were settled at a cost of &euro;627,911. Thus, the total paid under the PRS in respect of product destined for Russia was &euro;3,598,373.</p><p>  All of the above costs were paid to Irish processors who were obliged under the terms of the agreement with the industry to pass on the appropriate costs to their customers.</p></reply>

Indeed the Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) is based on the same successful discussion group model of the DEP and is a key element in driving the ambitious target for the sheepmeat Sector in Food Harvest 2020. </p><p>  The STAP is intended to provide participants with the knowledge and the skills necessary to improve on-farm technical efficiency in a number of key areas. The sheep sector is a key part of the Agrifood sector, especially in marginal land areas and there is huge scope to improve farm incomes through focusing on issues such as grassland management, financial management, breeding, health and welfare and environmental efficiency. As funding for this scheme is capped at &euro;3 million for 2013 and as dairy farmers have already benefitted from DEP 2010 to 2012, a policy decision was taken to focus STAP on drystock farmers having sheep or cattle.</p></reply>

Among the key drivers of future beef export performance in these markets will be the general macro-economic environment, the EU demand/supply balance and exchange rate developments, particularly with regard to the euro vis-&agrave;-vis sterling.</p><p>  The immediate outlook for Irish beef output is that it is forecast to rise by 10% in 2013 as reduced live exports over recent years boost volumes. Global beef supplies are likely to remain stable and, as a result, EU imports are unlikely to increase significantly in 2013. The challenge will be to maintain price levels but continuing tight availability of beef across Europe should help exporters. Concomitant with this broadly positive outlook is a continuing improvement in the positioning of Irish beef exports in key markets with over 60% of export volumes now destined for the higher value standard retail, premium food service, and retail or quick service sectors. </p><p>Exploiting the strong sustainability credentials of the grass-fed beef will be a key element in maintaining and expanding markets for the Irish beef industry up to 2015. In this context, the 32,000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>members of the Bord Bia Beef Quality Assurance (QA) Scheme are committed to actively measuring and reducing their carbon emissions. This is the only QA programme in the world that has an environmental element operating on a national basis. This important initiative will give Irish beef exports a genuine competitive advantage in securing premium product status in fiercely competitive foreign markets. Innovative product offerings supported by appropriate marketing are the best means of increasing market returns and viability across the supply chain.</p><p>  In addition, the leading Irish beef processing companies have also embraced the concept of sustainability under Origin Green. This is a comprehensive national sustainability development programme, the first of its kind in the world, designed by Bord Bia to assist Ireland to become known as the optimum source of sustainably produced food and drink. Industry recruitment commenced in June 2012 and to date a total of 188 companies have signed up to the programme. Central to the Origin Green concept is a sustainability charter that will commit Ireland&#8217;s agri-food industry, including beef processors, to engage directly and robustly with the challenges of sustainable production: reducing energy inputs, minimizing their overall carbon footprint and lessening their impact on the environment.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the fact that most Irish beef exports go to other EU member states, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of market outlets available for our beef products. My Department will be working &#8211; in collaboration with the industry, Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade &#8211; to secure access to more third country outlets for Irish beef over the next three years. At present, Irish beef enjoys access to markets in Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Russia, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p><p>  I have been assiduous in nurturing relationships in new and growing markets in order to build confidence in Irish production and control systems which will underpin long-term trading relationships in the future. As part of that effort, I headed trade missions last year to China and the USA, during which I raised the subject of access for Irish beef with my ministerial counterparts. Apart from China and the US, other targeted markets for Irish beef access include Japan and Korea as well as North African and Middle Eastern countries. My Department is engaging closely with the authorities in those countries to gain access for Irish beef products. There is a strong demand for beef globally and my Department remains focused, in consultation with the industry, on ensuring that Irish exporters will be able to fully exploit market opportunities as they arise over the coming years.</p></reply>

These take account of best available scientific information and involve all relevant stakeholders. Current proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy process, which have been prioritised by the Irish EU Presidency, encompass a range of innovative proposals for measures to eliminate the practice of  discards, that is the dumping fish at sea, achieving appropriate maximum long term sustainable yields (MSYs) and the introduction of effective fair transparent regionalisation mechanisms will,  if agreed by EU Member States, all help support the ongoing development of a sustainable and thriving Irish and European fishing industry for the future.  </p><p>  Addressing these issues effectively will also help to ensure the maintenance of jobs in the fishing industry while enabling a climate of innovation to thrive in both the fisheries and aquaculture sector. During the Irish Presidency one of my goals is to make significant progress on the CFP reform agenda to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to deliver sustainable fisheries for future generations. Addressing these issues effectively will also help to ensure the maintenance of jobs in the fishing industry while enabling a climate of innovation to thrive in the fisheries sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-12a.1309.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021200072#WRX02900"><p>The pig sector accounts for approximately 6% of the overall agri-food industry and is the third largest individual component of the agri-food sector. During 2012 output, prices and export values continued the growth seen in recent years, growing by 2%, 10% and 16% respectively. </p><p>  Currently pig prices are over 15% ahead of the same week last year. This equates to almost 23c/kg. When compared to the same week in 2010, prices have risen by over 46/c per kilo, or more than 38%.</p><p>  The &#8216;<i>Food Harvest 2020 Report</i>  &#8217;, published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector and targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020.  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally. Given that cereals account for up to 75% of pig feed, the impact of significant increases in cereal prices in recent years on the pig sector has been considerable.  While there has been some easing of soya prices in recent months thus ameliorating some of the consequences, they continue to remain significantly above historic averages. The weather affected harvests with drought in the USA and the Black Sea region leading to lower output and consequent upward pressure on prices.</p><p>  Following rebuilding and recovery efforts in recent years the future for the Irish pig sector remains challenging. Notwithstanding recent cereal price reductions, input prices are forecast to remain above long-term averages for the foreseeable future. In addition, difficulties in the non-feed elements of production such as credit availability, energy costs and compliance with the EU Loose Sow Housing Directive which came into force in January 2013 together with the decline in the size of the breeding herd pose significant challenges to producers. EU output is forecast to decline by 2-3% in 2013 which conversely will offer increased opportunities to Irish producers. However, the ongoing issues referred to above together with the near 7% decline in the Irish breeding herd in 2012, may limit Irish producers&#8217; scope to avail of these openings.</p><p>  In relation to the Loose Sow Housing Directive, an on-farm investment aid scheme (TAMS) &#8211; the Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced under Ireland&#8217;s Rural Development Programme 2007 &#8211; 2013, to facilitate producer compliance with the requirements. The scheme has been enhanced and extended on a number of occasions. While the majority of producers have worked extremely hard to achieve compliance, my Department became aware that a small number of producers had experienced difficulties with planning permission. With this in mind, I recently announced a further extension in the deadline for grant applications until 2 April 2013.</p><p>  I have provided a total of &#8364;16 million for this scheme. I should add that this funding is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over &#8364;6 million to successful applicants. </p><p>  With regard to financial support available to the pig industry, Enterprise Ireland operates various programmes relating to company development. Included among these are Research and Development and Innovation Funding. Through a mix of funding, advice and expertise, Enterprise Ireland works with companies planning or engaging in R&amp;D. Assistance for product development is also available through the Teagasc National Food Centre in Ashtown, Dublin 15. A number of businesses within the pig sector have availed of these programmes in recent years.</p><p>  Teagasc, through its Moorepark pig research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level. Teagasc have also circulated pig producers with a number of the options available to them to reduce feed costs and improve feed efficiency. </p><p>  In addition, Teagasc continues on an ongoing basis to develop enhanced systems of research, technical assistance and knowledge transfer in order to assist the pig sector.  </p><p>  In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, my Department has been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future. </p><p>  And of course Bord Bia continues, through its promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to help consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and international markets. This is proving particularly successful in international markets, primarily Russia and China where the value of Irish pigmeat exports grew to over &#8364;110 million in 2012. </p><p>  It is important to remember that pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide and this will continue to present opportunities for Irish producers, given our self-sufficiency. In addition, the measures outlined above, together with the progress made in the last few years in establishing and consolidating a presence in important international markets will better position Irish producers to take advantage of growing demand.</p></reply>

A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules.</p><p>  My Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010. Grant-aid is available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &euro;300,000, i.e. a maximum grant of &euro;120,000. A total of &euro;16 million has been allocated to this scheme under the Rural Development Programme. It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 and payments of &euro;6.2 million have already been made to pig producers. </p><p>  The scheme has been enhanced and extended on a number of occasions including provision being made to allow producers make multiple applications in instances where the producer has more than one sow house. While the majority of producers have worked extremely hard to achieve compliance, my Department is aware that a small number of producers have experienced difficulties with planning permission. With this in mind, I recently announced a further extension in the deadline for grant applications until 2 April. The final date for completion of work and the lodgment of payment claims is 30 September 2013. </p><p>  I and my Department are in regular contact with farm bodies, various national banks and the Banking Federation concerning the availability of credit to farmers, including those in the pig sector, who are under financial pressure. The banks provide information online, via the Irish Banking Federation, as to the type of information that they require when making a decision on a loan request in the agriculture sector. However, farmers who are not satisfied with the service provided by their banks can ask for an internal review by the relevant bank and if they are still not satisfied can apply to the Credit Review Office to have their case reviewed. Despite concerns, a relatively small number of cases from the Agri-Food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.</p></reply>

Achievement of our Food Harvest 2020 strategy is predicated on smart, green growth in the sector with an emphasis on investment and innovation.  In this connection, I have concerns about the current age profile of our farming population and I firmly believe we must actively encourage the younger generation to view farming as an attractive and sustainable career.</p><p>  It is for this reason that I have promoted the introduction of a number of tax reliefs aimed at bringing young people into the sector.</p><p>  The proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy contain a number of measures designed to attract young farmers to the sector.  These include a proposal for a 25% top-up payment, over and above the normal single farm payment, to farmers under 40, for a five year period.  I, along with a number of other Member States and the Commission, would prefer if this proposal was mandatory for Member States.  However, given that a large number of Member States would have difficulty with a mandatory scheme, I am prepared to live with an optional scheme although I can confirm that I have every intention of applying it in Ireland.</p><p>  There are also proposals for enhanced investment opportunities for young farmers within the draft Rural Development Regulation.  </p><p>  Of course, these measures form part of the CAP reform negotiations which are not yet finalised. My aim is to finalise the Council position on the CAP reform dossier and obtain a negotiating mandate by the end of March, leading to inter-institutional trilogues, with the aim of overall political agreement by the end of June.   </p><p>  I am confident of navigating through the diverging positions of Member States with a view to ensuring that the new CAP contains measures that will continue to attract young farmers into the sector.</p></reply>

The EU will prepare for this by facilitating discussion and organising a conference under the auspices of DG-Agri in Autumn 2013.  </p><p>  Family farming has always been the main form of farming in Ireland.  The key difficulties that I have seen are the lack of succession planning and the lack of availability of farm land for new entrants.  To meet these challenges new taxation measures were introduced in the last two budgets aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers.  Stamp duty on agricultural land was reduced from 6% to 2%.  In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.</p><p>  Budget 2012 also restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. </p><p>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.</p><p>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &#8364;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.</p><p>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief has been announced in the 2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes, once State Aid approval has been received, will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land. A recent EU Commission study found that </p><p>&#8216;<i>younger[farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force</i>&#8217;<sup> [[1]</sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas</i>, p. 25. Brussels, 12/10/2011.<sup>1]</sup>.</p><p>  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations. Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  </p><p>  I also believe that family farms are the places where young people can learn the required skills in partnership with parents and other family members.  Indeed Irish farming greatly benefits from the pooling of skills and knowledge of all family members and in this regard I would strongly encourage greater participation by women in farm decision making and management.  I am confident that providing an additional incentive to farm partnership formation will encourage farmers to consider more closely the benefits of farm partnerships to their farming business and in providing a better work-life balance. </p><p>  Encouraging farm partnerships will also support the dairy herd expansion required over the coming years, enabling Irish farmers to avail of the opportunity presented by the abolition of EU milk quotas in March 2015.</p></reply>

I asked Bord Bia to maintain constant contact with our export markets to reassure international buyers that there is no food safety issue involved and that the issue has been dealt with swiftly and appropriately by the Irish authorities. Initial market impact at consumer level (weekend of Jan 20th  ) indicated that the controversy was largely confined within the UK and Irish markets, where the affected products were on sale and taken off the shelf, where the media coverage has been intense and consumer awareness very high. The research indicated that consumers were ring-fencing the problem to this particular segment of the market, and not extending or generalising it to the wider industry. The processed meat sector is a relatively limited segment of the total Irish meat market and is not otherwise impacting on Irish food exports. Beyond these markets, media coverage, interest and awareness has been limited and no concerns whatever have been reported to Bord Bia by trade buyers or consumers. The fact that our controls identified this particular issue and the manner in which it has been addressed will assist in maintaining the confidence in Irish food.</p><p>  The Irish beef industry has a blue chip portfolio of high end supermarket and food service business in Europe&rsquo;s consumer markets that is without parallel. The industry&rsquo;s success is based on robust relationships with premium customers built up over an extended period and based on a track record of high quality standards, underpinned by our green credentials. More than 75% of all Irish beef exported is produced from some 34,000 farms which are members of the Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme. Similarly, under Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green programme, most of our meat exporters have also signed up to the implementation of a sustainability plan that commits them to the achievement of stretch targets in key areas around emissions, water, biodiversity and health and well-being. Based on these programmes Bord Bia will continue to strongly assert our high quality standards and green credentials at every opportunity. Recent and forthcoming international trade events at which Bord Bia have participated included Sirha Trade Show (Lyon), where Irish beef was selected to be the ingredient in the prestigious Bocuse D&rsquo;or competition, Prodexpo (Russia) and Gulf Food &ndash; the world&rsquo;s biggest food and hospitality exhibition. All of these trade events will be attended by a number of Irish meat companies who will be promoting the quality and sustainability of Irish beef, emphasising that we continue to adopt the highest standards of traceability and safety in our meat industry.</p></reply>

This involves regular consultation with fishing industry interests.  Our existing quota management system is designed to ensure the rational management of the available quotas, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, the best possible spread both between fishermen and also in terms of take up of quota during the year. A key objective is the avoidance of very early closure of fisheries through rapid exhaustion of quota. Under the current arrangements, fishing industry representatives are consulted formally through the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee on a monthly basis and their views are taken into account as far as possible in the determination of monthly regimes for particular stocks.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is the national body for the control and enforcement of sea fisheries law and work with the Naval Service to control and enforce compliance with quota management arrangements and accurate reporting of landings.   </p><p>  The CFP itself is currently in the process of undergoing significant reform, a process which has been prioritised for action under the Irish EU Presidency. Particular emphasis in the reform process will be on measures to eliminate discards, achieve appropriate maximum long term sustainable yields from annual fisheries and moves toward the introduction of fair and transparent regionalisation mechanisms. If as I hope, the Council and the EU Parliament reach agreement on these measures, the process should help support the ongoing development of a sustainable and thriving Irish and European fishing industry into the future. </p><p>  In common with procedures which operate here in Ireland individual EU Member States have similar responsibilities for the management of fisheries quotas. Inevitably the precise nature of these enforcement procedures may vary from one Member State to another. Any issues which may emerge in terms of management by individual member states are a matter for the EU Commission in terms of its responsibility to ensure the rules of the CFP are fully respected.</p></reply>

The role of my Department and other agencies working under service contracts with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement.  This is done by a combination of inspection of establishments and by audit of the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.  It is important to point out that the key controls carried out by my Department, under its contract with the FSAI, relate to food safety.  The matters that were the subject of the recent incident did not give rise to a food safety issue.</p><p>  The FSAI, as part of overall surveillance and monitoring of the food chain, carried out this random survey against a background of increasing prices of raw materials used in food and feed manufacture, and the global sourcing of ingredients.  In conducting this survey, a problem was uncovered which might otherwise have gone undetected here, or been discovered first in out overseas markets.  I am confident that the eventual impact and outcome will be positive for consumers and for the reputation of Ireland as a producer of safety and wholesome food.  As seen from recent developments, the problem has developed into a pan European investigation of food fraud involving a range of meat products and traders/food business operators.  Accordingly, I have arranged a meeting in Brussels tomorrow with EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy Borg and other relevant Ministers to consider the wider EU implications of the recent revelations concerning the presence of horse meat in beef products.  I have also requested Irish manufacturers of processed meat products to carry out DNA testing and to work with the FSAI in developing testing protocols for this purpose.</p></reply>

By any measure, this is both a very significant sum in itself and a very commendable achievement in terms of delivery.  To date, over 123,000 farmers have been paid in excess of &#8364;1,210 million under the 2012 Single Payment Scheme.  With regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I can confirm that payments worth in excess of &#8364;204 million have issued to some 93,000 applicants.  Under the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment cannot commence prior to 1 December.  I can confirm that these payments commenced on 10 December last and, to date, payments worth some &#8364;18 million have issued to 28,152 applicants.  The budget for the scheme is  &#8364;18 million.</p><p>  Payments under the Beef Technology Adoption Programme commenced on target in late December, with some &#8364;4.4 million already paid to in excess of 4,800 participants, while payments under the Dairy Efficiency Programme, worth in the region of &#8364;5.5 million, are on target to issue in the coming weeks, to some 5,500 participants.  Payments worth up to &#8364;1 million are also on schedule to shortly issue to those successfully participating in the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme.</p><p>  Area-based schemes under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13, are subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including cross checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, to be completed before payments can issue.  Payments under the agri-environment schemes, REPS and AEOS, in 2012 exceeded the levels of payments achieved in 2011.  Under REPS 4 all payments due in respect of the scheme years prior to 2012 have been made and a total of 26,145 of the 30,000 applicants have been already been paid their 2012 payment.</p><p>  Under AEOS I  all outstanding payments due in respect of both 2010 and 2011 have been finalised and of the 7,500 participants remaining in that scheme over 6,200 have received payment in respect of 2012.  Under AEOS II<b></b>5,070 of the 6,250 approved applicants have been paid in respect of 2011.  Applicants have been informed of outstanding queries.  2012 represents the first full year payment for AEOS 2 applicants and in order to activate payment where non productive capital investments were selected a valid capital investment claim form must have been submitted.  The high level of queries and farmer delays in submitting valid claims has resulted in a lower than expected level of 2012 payments under AEOS 2.  Nearly 2,100 have received payment at this stage and to deal with outstanding queries additional resources have been directed to this area with the intention of clearing the backlog as soon as possible.  Requests and reminders have issued to farmers that have not submitted valid claim forms and where applicants have received correspondence in this regard they should respond as soon as possible.</p><p>  Grant payments under Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) are also subject to eligibility checks including on farm inspections in order to assess eligibility and payments are dependent on the completion of the project concerned and submission of a valid, documented claim.  There is no undue delay between the date of receipt of the payment claim and its verification and the subsequent issue of payment.</p></reply>

Most of the fisheries resource within the area comes under the remit of the EUs Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In June 2012, the European Commission reported that fish stocks in European waters are improving (EC COM(2012) 278 final). The proportion of overfished stocks in the Atlantic declined from around 90% of all stocks between 2005-2009 to 47% in 2012. Several stocks in the west of Scotland, Irish Sea and Celtic sea have suffered from being over fished in the past and remain at relatively low levels (i.e. Cod in Divisions VIa and VIIa, Sole in Division VIIa, Whiting in Divisions VIa and VIIa). Scientific advice is that exploitation rates of these depleted stocks appears to remain high in most cases despite significant reductions in fishing effort over the last decade (EC COM(2012) 278. </p><p>  The Marine Institute has given a workable definition to sustainable fisheries ie  when a fishery  can be &lsquo;conducted over the long term at an acceptable level of biological and economic productivity, without leading to ecological changes that exclude options for future generations&rsquo;. Optimum levels of biological and economic productivity are in part management decisions, but though considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of addressing sustainability issues it is clear that for many stocks there is still room for further improvement. The European Union and Member States have committed themselves to reach the objectives of fishing at MSY by 2015 where possible. </p><p>  Reform of the CFP itself which is currently under discussion at EU level will help to address many of the key long term fisheries sustainability issues. The advancement of this reform agenda  has been prioritised by the Irish EU Presidency.   Current proposals for CFP reform encompass a range of innovative proposals for measures to eliminate the practice of  discards, achieving appropriate maximum long term sustainable yields (MSYs) and the introduction of effective fair transparent regionalisation mechanisms.  It is my belief that the introduction and implementation of these necessary and timely reforms (which must be adopted under co-decision jointly by the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament) will support the ongoing development of a sustainable and thriving Irish and European fishing industry for the future. </p></reply>

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.</p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.</p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.</p><p>  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.</p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.</p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.</p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.</p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the HSE.   Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations and are not required to notify.   Decisions on how best to regulate and support the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.</p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is pro-active in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.  I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of publishing the Heads was to allow for a full consultation at an early stage on developing the Bill. </p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report and my Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders.</p></reply>

Its functions emphasise school attendance, participation and retention. The various strands of the NEWB, the School Completion Programme (SCP), the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) and the Educational Welfare Service (EWS) work together to secure improved educational outcomes for children and young people. </p><p>  I am advised by the NEWB that cases where there are significant concerns about a child&rsquo;s attendance at school, including a Traveller child or where a child is identified as &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; of persistent poor attendance or early school leaving are prioritised by the Board</p><p>  The Service does not retain records on individual children on the basis of Traveller or other cultural identities, but in 2012 the Educational Welfare Service worked with 20,011 children who experienced school attendance difficulties. </p><p>  Within the School Completion Programme, schools may identify particular at-risk children from within the Traveller community for additional supports. The latest data, as reported by schools, for the 2010 / 11 school year estimates that of the 36,147 children participating within the SCP, some 11% were Traveller students.</p><p>  The SCP supports Traveller students through the provision of school, after school, holiday and out of school supports. In particular Traveller students participate in homework clubs, which are organised in some Traveller sites so students go home directly after school and can avail of the homework club facility in their own environment. Homework clubs are facilitated and organised, in many cases, in partnership with local youth services or Pavee Point.</p><p>  The NEWB participates on the Traveller Education Strategy Advisory and Consultative Forum, which is facilitated by the Department of Education and Skills and monitors the implementation of the Traveller Education Strategy. The Board has convened a working group under the auspices of the Forum to develop collaborative working arrangements between the NEWB and Traveller Support Organisations (Pavee Point, Irish Traveller Movement, Traveller Women's Forum and Traveller MABS). The objective of the group is to work effectively at local and national level to support traveller parents in their responsibilities to ensure their children remain in school and to develop mechanisms to improve educational outcomes for Traveller children.</p><p>  The implementation of the Board&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&rdquo; strategy is focussed on securing improved educational outcomes for all students and prioritises those most at risk of early school leaving.</p></reply>

In an Irish context, the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) service is the equivalent of CAFCASS. The future governance and organisational arrangements relating to the GAL service are currently the subject of review. </p><p>  The Government has given approval to the drafting of a Bill to establish the Child and Family Support Agency.  Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established as soon as possible.   The Government's consideration of the functions of the new Child and Family Support Agency was informed, inter alia, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July 2012.  The Task Force considered that the Agency needs to be as broadly based as possible and should include those services that might, in the first instance, help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services the Task Force considered that the core services of the new Agency must include a broad based range of universal and targeted services with an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  </p></reply>

An administrative arrangement is not mandatory for intercountry adoption between countries that are both signatories to Hague.   However some contracting states, including Ireland,  may determine that in some instances co-operation in the field of intercountry adoption is best served by the development of such arrangements. </p><p>  The Adoption Authority  is continuing its work to establish administrative arrangements with a number of Hague countries in relation to intercountry adoptions, as provided for under section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010. The Authority has travelled to a number of jurisdictions in order to make contact with the Central Authorities, advise of our processes and procedures, assess the need for additional administrative arrangements or agreements; and to glean as much information as possible of relevance to prospective adopters from those countries. The visits also provide opportunities to streamline processes on both sides and obtain up-to-date information for prospective adopters on developments in these countries. </p><p>  In September 2012 the AAI and the Vietnamese Central Authority for Adoption agreed administrative arrangements for intercountry adoption. This is the first international administrative arrangement for intercountry adoption entered into by the AAI and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since both countries ratified the Hague Convention.  I understand that the process of approving accredited bodies by the Vietnamese Central Authority is underway.</p><p>  A delegation from the Adoption Authority made an official visit to the US State Department in Washington in 2012. Following this visit administrative arrangements in relation to intercountry adoption between the United States of America and Ireland were drafted by the AAI and the Authority informs me that it expects to finalise these arrangements in the near future.  </p><p>  A delegation from the Authority is due to travel to India in the coming weeks to meet with officials from CARA, the Indian Central authority. I have recently met with a group of prospective adoptive parents hoping to adopt from India and I am available for a diplomatic meeting with the Indian authorities should that prove helpful in advancing the administrative arrangements with CARA.</p><p>  ARC has been accredited to facilitate adoptions from Bulgaria and the Authority informs me that the first referrals from Bulgaria are due shortly.</p></reply>

The SCP is one of three service strands, which also includes the Home School Community Liaison and the Education Welfare Service, being integrated under the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.</p><p>  In 2013, funding of &euro;26.456m has been made available by my Department to support the programme, which involves 124 projects and initiatives throughout the country.</p><p>  The Local Management Committee assesses the needs of marginalised educationally disadvantaged students at local level to devise an integrated, costed and targeted proposal of interventions to support these young people. This project model approach allows the Local Management Committee the autonomy to be creative and innovative in developing strategies to encourage attendance, retention and participation of the targeted young people. Accordingly, it is a matter for the SCP to decide on the use of SCP funds in the context of the available grant and the overall programme of activities. </p><p>  In September 2012, the Local Management Committee responsible for each SCP project was notified that a reduction on last year&rsquo;s allocation would apply for the coming academic cycle. &euro;341,234 was made available to the School Completion Project raised by the Deputy for the 12/13 academic year.</p><p>  Projects were requested to revise their plans for 2012/13 in order to achieve efficiencies and reduce costs whilst prioritising evidence based services to support children&rsquo;s educational outcomes. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), under the remit of my Department, has provided assistance to projects through this process in accordance with its management responsibilities for the programme.</p><p>  In the present challenging financial circumstances it is not feasible to alter the notified allocations to individual projects. I would note that my Department intends to complete a review of the SCP over the course 2013. It is anticipated that the review will assist to identify operational efficiencies and other reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing as a key component of an integrated school support service under the NEWB. </p><p>  The purchase of food by schools is separately funded by the Department of Social Protection. In this instance these funds are channelled through the local School Completion Programme.  I am advised by the NEWB that the Local Management Committee of the Programme in question, having reviewed all provisions across its programme, took the decision to prioritise SCP funding this year for interventions in other areas. However, I am advised by the NEWB that the Local Co-ordinator and SCP Chairperson are continuing to explore options to support delivery of the meals programme for students in the schools in question.</p></reply>

I met with the Board of the VHI on 19 December last and with the Chair and CEO last month to voice my concerns and to emphasise the absolute need for VHI to manage its costs.  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures including professional fees.  I have consistently urged the VHI and all health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of health insurance and I am determined to address costs in the sector, in the interests of consumers.</p><p>  The Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible and remains committed to protecting community rating, whereby everyone pays the same price for the same health insurance product, irrespective of age or health status.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2012 introduced a new permanent Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) for the private health insurance market with effect from 1 January 2013.   An effective and robust RES is required  in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.   The Scheme is also of benefit to insurers with increased adverse risks, in particular, the VHI.</p><p>  My officials have had a number of discussions with VHI officials to assist them in understanding the divergence between their calculation of the effectiveness of the new RES  and that of my Department. My Department has also conferred with its actuarial advisors who have concluded that the calculation methodology used by VHI understates the effectiveness of the scheme. In addition, the Health Insurance Authority ( HIA) , the industry regulator, has confirmed, based on market average claim costs for prescribed benefits, that the 2013 scheme compensates for 75% of the higher claims costs for those aged in their seventies and compensates for 83% of the higher claims costs for those aged in their eighties. The 2013 scheme has also provided for a measure of health status whereby an amount of &euro;75 per night will be payable from the Risk Equalisation Fund in respect of each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation, including in a designated private bed in a publicly funded hospital.  This measure benefits each insurer who pays for a customer to use an overnight hospital bed and also benefits VHI to a significant level given its market share and customer profile.</p><p>  I should also point out that compensation levels under risk equalisation are based on average claims for the market as a whole rather than on the claims for any particular insurer such as VHI.  To do otherwise might be seen as providing an incentive for inefficiencies in claims cost management.</p></reply>

It has been delayed by a number of factors including the changed economic context, constraints in public spending and the moratorium on recruitment.</p><p>  Nonetheless, a great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Progress also includes shorter episodes of in-patient care and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery. </p><p>  A modern mental health service is best delivered in the community and in 2012 a special allocation of &#8364;35m was provided primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children&#8217;s mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems and to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with AVFC  <i>. </i></p><p>  Budgetary pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of this funding, but this sum is now available to mental health services along with an additional &#8364;35m allocated in Budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services.  This represents a total of &#8364;70m additional revenue to modernise and reform our mental health services in 2013.  Over 800 new mental health professionals are being employed to strengthen these services.  </p><p>  I presume the Deputy is referring to the Independent Monitoring Group for <i>A Vision for Change</i> which ceased its term in June 2012.  This Group was appointed in line with the recommendations in AVFC to assess and report on progress on implementation. <i></i>  AVFC also contained a commitment that it would be reviewed after seven years.  </p><p>  In relation to the review of the Mental Health Act 2001, Section 75 the Act obliges the Minister to carry out a review of the operation of the Act not later than 5 years after the establishment day.  While a limited review was conducted in 2007, a more comprehensive review is required now as Part Two of the Act only commenced in November 2006.  </p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to review the Mental Health Act 2001 and in June 2011, I appointed a Steering Group to undertake the first phase of the review.  The terms of reference for the initial phase of the review required the Steering Group to consider &#8220;<i>the extent to which the recommendations of A Vision for Change could or should be underpinned by legislation&#8221;.  </i>  This was done on the basis that the Mental Health Act 2001 which was enacted five years before the publication of AVFC does not reflect the significant changes in thinking about the delivery of mental health services that have taken place in the last ten years, such as the shift to community based services, the adoption of a recovery approach in every aspect of service delivery and the involvement of service users as partners in their own care and in the development of the service.  </p><p>  With the direct connection between the Mental Health Act and <i>A Vision for Change</i>, it makes sense that we finalise our work on the review of the Act before considering a review of <i>Vision.</i>   I expect that the review of the Act will be completed and presented to me in quarter two of this year.  In the interim, the HSE continues to implement <i>A Vision for Change</i>   with substantial additional funding provided in  2012 and 2013, and reports on this on a monthly basis, through the HSE National Service Plan. </p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. </p><p>  The Department is preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance which will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. The work involved is both complex and technical, necessitating significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  This, in turn, demands a wide-range of specialised expertise. The Department is engaged in a process to ensure the provision of this expertise to feed into work on the preparation of the White Paper during 2013.  The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&#8217;s term of office.  </p><p>  In advance of the White Paper, my Department has produced a Preliminary Paper on UHI, which I intend to publish shortly. </p><p>The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years. The Programme for Government acknowledges that full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve. <i>Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015 </i>  highlights the importance of a step-by-step evidence-based approach to achieving an effective, equitable and efficient system and sets out key actions to systematically deliver on reform.  It is anticipated that by 2016 the necessary groundwork will be in place to enable us to phase in  implementation of UHI, as promised in the Programme for Government. </p><p>It is my intention to consult widely on the reform implementation process, including the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance, when published. I have already commenced this process. For example, in the two weeks following the launch of <i>Future Health,</i>I met with some 1,500 local clinical and administrative staff and management as well as regional health forums at fourteen different events across the four HSE regions.</p></reply>

The HSE will continue to accept applications on an ongoing basis for 2012 graduates, and also those who graduated in 2010 and 2011.   Further recruitment will continue during 2013. In particular, Phase 2, which will cover Mental Health, Intellectual Disability, Midwifery and Paediatrics, will launch in the coming days.  There will also be opportunities for those who graduate in 2013 to participate in due course.</p><p>  The initiative will give nursing and midwifery graduates an employment opportunity and facilitate their professional development at a time when it is not possible to offer permanent posts given the requirement to reduce the numbers employed in the health sector.  They will be able to avail of a suite of educational programmes including intravenous canulation and training in anaphylaxis treatment. It has also been agreed that participants will be facilitated in obtaining a certificate in advanced healthcare skills to cover areas such as health assessment and pharmacology.</p></reply>

The proposal was published following extensive consultation of stakeholders in an EU wide public consultation which generated 85,000 responses.

These Programmes have three main objectives &ndash; to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost-effectiveness.  Their primary aim is to modernise the way hospital services are provided across a wide range of clinical areas.  This is being done through standardising access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services and maximising linkages to primary care and other community services.  Cork and Beaumont are two of six regional centres which have been identified for the provision of specialist epilepsy services under the Clinical Care Programme for Epilepsy.  It is intended that services will be provided by a team of nurses and consultant neurologists working as a virtual national network supporting all acute and primary care locations.  Rapid Access Clinics (separate to the Epilepsy Monitoring Units) have been developed at four of centres so far and 10.5 (WTE) Advanced Nurse Practitioners have been recruited to lead these clinics, so that a total of 12 Advanced Nurse Practitioners are now in place across the four centres.   When the Epilepsy Monitoring Units in CUH and Beaumont are open, they will increase pre-surgical evaluation capacity.  Monitoring is required for the most vulnerable patients with the worst effects of epilepsy and their development is therefore a priority for the Programme.  Patients at these units will require 24/7 care.  The staffing requirements to enable the units to be safely opened have been identified.</p><p>  With regard to recruitment, the Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.  I understand that the normal processes will apply to the HSE&rsquo;s decisions regarding the recruitment of the required staff in CUH and Beaumont.  With regard to Beaumont, the HSE has advised that Beaumont Hospital and the HSE are working jointly to fill the posts necessary to support service development.  I am advised that the staffing required for the unit includes five staff nurses, one consultant neurophysiologist and three technicians.  Of these, three staff nurse posts and one technician post remain to be recruited.  I am informed that this is being prioritised.  The recruitment of nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit as nursing staff come into post.  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that the Service Plan for 2013 for CUH is being drawn up currently and will be finalised in the coming weeks, and that the provision of additional staff for the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit is being considered as part of that process. </p><p>  With regard to the issue of exemption from generic substitution of anti-epileptic drugs, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  In making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the board is obliged to have regard to the criteria set out in the Bill.  These criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health/HSE report &quot;Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution&quot; (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted. I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised.  I met the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.</p></reply>

The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.

An additional 22 beds are scheduled to come on stream in 2013 (8 in Cork and 14 in Dublin), thus giving a projected Child and Adolescent capacity of 66 beds by the end of 2013.  Planning permission has been granted to construct a 24 bed in-patient facility at Cherry Orchard, Dublin.  This is expected to be completed by end 2013 / early 2014, with an expected opening date of 2015, and which would incorporate some existing beds to increase capacity overall to 76 beds.</p><p>  The increase in bed capacity reflects an almost 50% decrease in admissions of children to adult units since 2008, from 247 in 2008 to 132 in 2011.</p></reply>

The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to the an incident. </p><p>For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible.  Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is currently progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place, including in the greater Dublin area, and are operating successfully.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed key performance indicators (KPIs) for pre-hospital emergency care, which classify 999 emergency calls by clinical status.  Clinical Status 1 (Echo) calls involve life-threatening emergencies of cardiac or respiratory origin, while Clinical Status 1 (Delta) calls involve life-threatening emergencies other than cardiac or respiratory.  The target times for responding to Echo and Delta calls are 7 minutes 59 seconds by a first responder (a person trained in minimum basic life support and use of a defibrillator) and 18 minutes 59 seconds for a patient-carrying vehicle.  With effect from January 2012, HIQA set the standard at 75% within the target time for first responders and a target has been set at 80% within the target time for patient-carrying vehicles.</p><p>The NAS has been taking a number of steps to improve emergency responses.  These include development of a Performance Improvement Action Plan, an Intermediate Care Service, the national control centre reconfiguration project and a trial emergency aeromedical service. </p><p>In light of the above, and following a review of the validity of time-based KPIs, it is considered, in line with international views, that clinical outcomes would be more appropriate as performance indicators.  Accordingly, work has begun on their development.I also welcome the fact that use of clinical indicators will enable a focus on Clinical Status 1 (Echo and Delta) calls. </p><p>In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters, they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p></reply>

I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine.

My Department has written to the National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office and the Regional Directors of Operations in the HSE asking them to alert relevant hospital staff to this initiative and to the code which will appear on new driving licences of people who wish to donate.  My Department is also in discussion with the Department of Social Protection with a view to including a similar code on the Public Services Card.  </p></reply>

The Involuntary admission of persons to a psychiatric hospital or unit in the 1950's and 1960's was governed by the 1945 Mental Treatment Act. The 1945 Act allowed for the admission and detention without their consent, of a person as a  'temporary patient' or a 'person of unsound mind'  following an application received and accompanied by a medical certificate, signed by a doctor and on foot of a reception order signed by a consultant psychiatrist. </p><p>  There were no provisions in the 1945 Act for an automatic right of appeal to an independent judicial body against a person's involuntary detention in a psychiatric hospital. However, the Act did provide patients with the right to write a letter to the Minister for Health &amp; Children, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals or the President of the High Court. It also required the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, in the course of his inspections, to visit any patient &quot;the propriety of whose detention he had reason to doubt&quot;.</p><p>  The Mental Health 2001 Act significantly modernised procedures relating to involuntary admission by establishing for the first time independent Mental Health Tribunals which review, and affirm or revoke detention orders. Patients now have the right to be heard and to be legally represented at the Tribunal. </p><p>  The Mental Health Act 2001, is being reviewed at present in line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government to review the Act &quot;informed by human rights standards and in consultation with service users, carers and other stakeholders&quot;  and the Government and I attach great importance to the review. A Steering Group established in 2011  to oversee the first part of the review published their Interim Report on 21 June 2012 and this is available on my Department's website. In August last year, I announced the membership of an Expert Group to carry out the second and substantive phase of the review. The Expert Group is continuing its deliberations and is expected to produce its report in quarter 2 2013.   </p></reply>

Since the programme commenced seventeen years ago, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants. I am advised that Beaumont Hospital carried out over ninety cochlear implants in 2012 and that over seven hundred patients are currently under the care of the hospital programme which provides rehabilitation and programming on a recurring basis.  I understand that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme (ACCP)  have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous cochlear implantation in children into the future.  An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation.

The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.

There is not a community in Ireland that has not been affected by suicide.  We know that reducing suicide rates requires a collective, concerted effort and most importantly a collaborative approach.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) was established by the HSE in 2005 to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out</i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005 &#8211; 2014.  <i> Reach Out </i>is a comprehensive and integrated approach to reducing the loss and suffering from suicide and suicidal behaviours.  It encompasses the promotion, coordination, and support of activities to be implemented at national, regional and community levels.</p><p>  Currently there are many organisations working in the area of mental health promotion and suicide prevention.  Many communities affected by suicide have responded by trying  to find ways of coping with it and preventing it.  Ordinary people  concerned about suicide and people directly affected by suicide have come together with the common goal of dealing with the challenge of suicide and strengthening the community after a suicide has happened.  Suicide prevention is about promoting positive mental health and supporting people to learn a range of positive coping strategies so that they can better deal with difficulties in their lives.  To assist communities, the HSE last year published <i>Suicide Prevention in the Community - A Practical Guide, </i>which aims to provide information to help make communities safer from suicide.</p><p>  The NOSP funds a range of agencies providing prevention, intervention, postvention and research services across the voluntary and statutory sector.  It  currently funds 26 agencies with over 40 programmes.  Projects funded in 2012 include: BelongTo, Bodywhys, Console, Samaritans, National Suicide Research Foundation, Spunout, Teenline, Young Social Innovators,  etc.  In 2013, there will be further investment in a range of existing and new initiatives.  The NOSP publishes an Annual Report, which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, that details its work programme and expenditure for the year.  The latest report published is for 2011.</p><p>  Irrespective of the number of agencies working in this area, it is vital that we ensure that this work is connected/interlinked and avoids duplication, is evidence and needs based and offers value for money.  In order to get maximum benefit from the investment in suicide prevention and ensure a coordinated response to the needs of those at risk of or affected by suicide, the NOSP will continue to coordinate  the work of the many different voluntary, statutory and non-statutory organisations working in this area.  By promoting cross-organisational collaboration, the development of networks and partnerships, skills sharing and service development, the NOSP hopes to maximise the impact of a suicide prevention and support network in Ireland, to ensure it reaches and responds effectively to people who are vulnerable.  The NOSP is currently working to integrate current programmes so as to reduce duplication within the sector, and provide a strategic framework for the coordination of the extensive range of actions in this area.</p></reply>

The aim of bereavement support is to support those immediately affected by the death, to allow them to express their grief and to prevent more suicides from happening in the same area.  A range of local and national services provide suicide bereavement support to families and communities.  The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention provides funding to Console to deliver suicide bereavement support services across the country.  The organisation has six regional offices and has a dedicated helpline for individuals bereaved by suicide.  The National Office also provides funding to Counselling, Responding, Information &amp; Bereavement Services in HSE South and to Mayo Suicide Liaison Project.</p><p>  It is important that those providing bereavement support services follow evidence-based practice.  In this regard, the National Office for Suicide Prevention, Console and Turas le Cheile developed national quality standards for all levels of suicide bereavement support in Ireland.  These standards provide a significant resource for those organisations providing support to individuals at a very vulnerable time in their lives.</p></reply>

It encompasses the promotion, coordination, and support of activities to be implemented at national, regional and community levels.</p><p>  Since the launch of <i>Reach Out </i>and the establishment of the NOSP, there has been a significant amount of cross-sectoral working which has resulted in considerable advances in suicide prevention.  The NOSP has implemented many of the action areas engaging a strategic approach in four key areas - delivering a general population approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention; using targeted programmes for people at high risk of suicide; delivering services to individuals who have engaged in deliberate self harm and providing support to families and communities bereaved by suicide; and commissioning research into suicidal behaviour.  Initiatives progressed to date include:</p><p>- Suicide awareness training programmes.</p><p>- The tough economic times programme.</p><p>- Mental Health awareness campaigns.</p><p>- Supporting voluntary organisations in their work on suicide prevention.</p><p>- Developing all-island cooperation in the areas of promoting positive mental health and tackling the issue of suicide.</p><p>- Funding a number of Suicide Community Assessment Nurses (SCAN) to work within primary care to provide an effective and coordinated response for people who are in distress.  </p><p>Each year the NOSP publishes an annual report which outlines the work that has been undertaken under <i>Reach Out.</i></p><p>  In relation to the 26 Action Areas and the 96 Recommendations of the strategy work has commenced on each of these Recommendations.  Earlier this year, the NOSP established a Working Group comprising the statutory and voluntary sectors to review the current activities in the area of suicide prevention and to determine the priorities within this area to ensure that we maximise available resources.  The Group will also review current national and international evidence on effective approaches in suicide prevention and will consider how the emerging evidence base can be used to inform the remaining period of the <i>Reach Out</i> strategy and influence new policy on suicide prevention beyond 2014.</p></reply>

Of the 35, approximately 20 will be offered to the market subject to a) agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement in the centres and b) site suitability and availability.  The HSE is currently analysing the available sites in each location and engaging with the GPs in each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.  While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.  The estimated capital allocation of &euro;115m indented for the PPP initiative and announced in July 2012 cannot be allocated to the HSE's annual capital allocation, and therefore cannot be used for direct-build or to upgrade existing facilities.</p></reply>

The Royal Canal tow path is the selected route for the section of the facility between Maynooth and Mullingar.  Design of this section is currently underway and will be the subject of planning processes in Meath and Kildare this summer.  If successful, and if funding for construction is available, construction work on this section could commence in autumn 2013.</p><p>  The section from the Meath/Westmeath county boundary to Mullingar is currently under construction.  Route selection has commenced on the section between Mullingar and Ballinasloe.  One option that is being examined is the use of the disused railway between Mullingar and Athlone.

That section of the Act places the supply of data on penalty points to the insurance industry on a legal footing.  The new measure will give insurance companies reliable and up-to-date information from my Department's National Vehicle Driver File (NVDF) on serious offences which have incurred penalty points.  As the Deputy maybe aware, insurance companies already have access to the NVDF to verify the number of penalty points incurred by individual drivers.  Now, they will be able to determine whether an offence involved drink driving, speeding, using a mobile phone, or any of the 13 specific categories of serious offence.</p><p>  There are currently 2.67 million licensed drivers in Ireland of whom 487,000 have penalty points applied to their licence records.  The new system will be implemented across the motor insurance sector on a phased basis over the next few months.  The information will not be available to the general public and the arrangement is subject to strict data protection controls.  Penalty points data for endorsement on the NVDF as required by Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 derives from two sources An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service.  While it is a matter for both bodies to satisfy themselves that all the details necessary for the endorsement of penalty points on the NVDF are recorded by them prior to transfer, my Department is satisfied that where such details are transferred, the appropriate number of penalty points are endorsed on the NVDF.</p></reply>

SPSV&rsquo;s are typically vehicles which carry less than 9 passengers on a commercial basis for hire or reward. </p><p>  Action 10 of the Taxi Regulation Review Report published at the beginning of 2012 recommends that a 9 year vehicle age limit should apply at licence issue or renewal for all new vehicles entering the fleet and for vehicles that have entered the fleet since 1st January 2009. Those entrants to the taxi industry since January 2009 have entered the industry on the basis of a 9-year age limit on vehicles. </p><p>  As a transitional arrangement, existing vehicles in the fleet prior to 1 January 2009 can operate up to 14 years of age subject to 6-monthly NCT testing and NTA licence renewal assessment. Therefore, it is envisaged that, over time, all vehicles older than nine years will be removed from the taxi and hackney fleet.</p></reply>

The person must own the SPSV vehicle licence and the vehicle that the licence relates to; must provide appropriate insurance for the rental period; and, must notify the NTA of the rental agreement.</p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Bill 2012, which I hope will be enacted by the Oireachtas in the first half of this year, provides for a prohibition on transfer of all SPSV licences.

The port of Cork Company has invested in the provision of facilities for these vessels  including berth upgrades, dredging, employee and pilot training and regional tourism promotion in order to attract and accommodate vessels of this size. Dublin Port can also accommodate vessels of this size in Alexandra Quay, while smaller liners can come up the river Liffey close to the city centre.</p><p>  My Department encourages ports and other relevant organisations to investigate opportunities to increase Ireland's share of the cruise tourism market and further develop Ireland as a cruise destination.  Port companies are also encouraged to develop or expand cruise facilities, where they consider it is appropriate to do so, using their own resources.</p></reply>
