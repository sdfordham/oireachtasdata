The licence, which is a follow-on authorisation to Licensing Option 08/2, covers an area of approximately 380 square kilometres in the Kish Bank Basin off the Dublin/Wicklow coast.  Star Energy&rsquo;s stake in the licence is now held by PSE Seven Heads Limited.</p><p>  The licence was granted for a six-year period and includes an obligation to drill an exploration well by 17th  August 2014.  </p><p>  While my Department has not as yet received a detailed application from Providence Resources for approval to drill on the licence, I am aware that environmental and safety concerns have been raised about the proximity of the proposed well to Dublin Bay.</p><p>  In this regard, I can assure the Deputy that drilling operators are required to comply with best international practice when carrying out drilling operations offshore Ireland. My Department will only give an approval to drill once it is satisfied that drilling operations can be carried out in a safe manner and without negative social or environmental impact.</p><p>  Exploration Licence holders are required to engage a competent Independent Well Examiner to verify the safety of all drilling rigs, drilling equipment, pressure containment systems and drilling processes in advance of and during drilling operations.  The well examiner has a role for as long as drilling operations continue and is required to verify any changes to drilling plans.  Ongoing monitoring by the Independent Well Examiner, my Department&rsquo;s Advisers and my Department&rsquo;s technical specialists continues throughout the drilling of a well.</p></reply>

The construction and operation of the East West Interconnector is the statutory responsibility of EirGrid.  The cost of the Interconnector is underwritten by all electricity customers under the regulatory model implemented by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p><p>  The East West Interconnector is a strategically vital energy project for the island of Ireland. It will critically contribute to national security of energy supply and competition as well as underpinning the progressive development of renewable energy, and the convergence of the electricity markets across these islands.  I am informed by EirGrid that the latter stages of the testing phase have identified some technical issues which they are investigating with a view to the full commissioning of the interconnector as soon as possible.</p><p>  The position of successive Governments over many years is that nuclear power is neither sustainable nor the answer to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s energy needs.  This position is shared by several EU Member States.  Moreover, the use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in Ireland is prohibited by statute.  These prohibitions do not include the importation of electricity generated by nuclear energy elsewhere.</p><p>  It is the case that nuclear generation forms part of the overall UK generation fuel mix.  The Lisbon Treaty legally provides for individual Member States to determine their own energy mix.  Ireland currently imports electricity from time to time from Northern Ireland, which is in turn linked to the UK electricity market via the Moyle Interconnector. Electricity imports from the UK will be increased with the completion of the East West Interconnector.</p><p>  It is not technically feasible to guarantee that electricity imported over an interconnector is not generated from nuclear sources as it is not possible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply or generation.</p><p>  This is a landmark project in the history of Irish energy policy.  I am informed by EirGrid that investigations arising from the latter states of the testing will have to be completed before full commissioning.</p></reply>

These spectrum bands are highly suitable for advanced mobile services due to their excellent propagation properties, which allow for wide area coverage and improved in-building reception.</p><p>  ComReg set out the process it has adopted for the award of rights of use for radio frequencies in the 800Mhz, 900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands in its information memorandum and associated documents (ComReg document 12/52).  These documents also set out the reasons, analysis and other material relied upon by ComReg in support of its substantive decisions regarding the minimum coverage and rollout requirements for the rights of use to be granted in the award process.</p><p>  Amongst other things, ComReg considered that actual coverage levels are expected to exceed a minimum 70% population obligation given the competitive nature of the market and the limited risk of roll-back of coverage from the existing levels.  ComReg also noted that coverage continues to be an important differentiator in the mobile telecommunications market such that any material deterioration in coverage by any one network would undermine that network&rsquo;s attractiveness to its existing and potential costumers.  It is also important to note that the coverage proposals are designed to facilitate the possible entry of new operators in a matter that would ensure that &lsquo;cherry picking&rsquo; of high density urban areas would not occur. </p><p>  This award process is a vital step in allowing for the next generation of advance mobile services to be made available for Irish consumers and businesses from next year.  The process of awarding of spectrum rights is entirely a matter for ComReg and I am not in a position to comment on it progress.</p></reply>

The Government has also reiterated its commitment to retaining the gas networks as well as the two gas interconnectors in State ownership as national strategic infrastructure, critical for the delivery of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies.</p><p>  BG&Eacute; is a strong and dynamic State company.  The success of Bord G&aacute;is Energy demonstrates BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s capacity to develop new and efficient businesses for the benefit of Irish consumers as well as the State as shareholder.</p><p>  The decision to establish Irish Water within the BG&Eacute; Group reflects the Government&rsquo;s confidence in BG&Eacute;.  BG&Eacute;&rsquo;s experience in the key areas of raising finance, operating and investing in critical network infrastructure and delivering excellent customer service, will be effectively deployed in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.</p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, has advised that the implementation strategy for Irish Water is being finalised by his Department, in collaboration with BG&Eacute;, all relevant Departments, including my Department, as well as the local authorities, and with the advice of NewERA.</p><p>  In parallel, significant progress has been made in implementing the asset disposal programme, in line with our commitments under the EU/ECB/IMF Funding Programme.  Tender processes for the appointment of financial advisors to oversee the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy are underway.</p><p>  NewERA is the agency with responsibility for oversight of the sale transaction on behalf of the Government.  My Department is also progressing priority actions to address necessary legislative, regulatory, and financial issues with a view to commencing the disposal process in 2013.  The Departments, NewERA and BG&Eacute; are fully cognisant of the need to ensure that the work on the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy and the establishment of the Water utility are progressed concurrently and to schedule.  The Government will be briefed on a regular basis in relation to progress on both fronts.</p><p>  I am confident that BG&Eacute; will rise to the challenge to sustain its oversight and operation of the strategic State owned gas infrastructure as well as working with the Government on the successful sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy and the establishment of Irish Water to schedule.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-11a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101100038#WRA01900"><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30 megabits per second are available to all enterprises and homes well in advance of the target date of 2020 set by the EU Commission in the EU &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo;.  The 30 megabits speed is a minimum target, I expect that significantly higher speeds will be available to as many enterprises and homes as possible.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan for Ireland commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically: 70&ndash;100 megabits per second  will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40 megabits per second and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and a minimum of 30 megabits per second  for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  The provision of electronic communications services, which includes the provision of high speed broadband services, operates within a fully liberalised EU internal market. Intervention by any Government in that market must comply with EU competition law and its rules on State Aids in particular.</p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators and no issue of State Aid arises. </p><p>  A qualifying requirement of EU State Aids&rsquo; rules generally is that the aid does not displace or distort public or private commercial investment in that product market at the quality level required. </p><p>  In the case of state aid for broadband products and services, any State Aid must comply with EU Commission guidelines specific to State Aid investment in broadband infrastructure.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country, as required by the sectoral state aids guidelines.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department on the mapping exercise.</p><p>  An additional requirement of the guidelines is that any market intervention is technology neutral.  The National Broadband Plan cannot therefore dictate the technological solution which will be used in a future public procurement process to identify a network provider or providers.</p><p>  The outcome of the mapping exercise is an essential element in any State Aids notification and will also inform the design of the procurement process.  The responses received from the commercial market in the procurement process will determine the technological solution or solutions to be used.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-11a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101100038#WRA02300"><p>While the results of the recent appraisal well on Barryroe are encouraging, further appraisal work will be required to determine if the discovery can be declared commercial and proceed to a petroleum production project.</p><p>  It is a core policy objective of my Department to maximise the benefits to the State from exploration for and production of our indigenous oil and gas resources.  The principal strategy in this regard is to encourage exploration investment, while ensuring that exploration activities are conducted safely and with due regard to their impact on the environment.</p><p>  While development projects can generate a significant amount of economic activity, the principal direct financial benefit to Ireland from successful exploration will come in the form of the corporation tax paid on profits from petroleum production.</p><p>  The tax terms, which were last revised in 2007, provide for a tax take of between 25% and 40% of profits made and seek to strike a balance between maximising the financial return to the State and the need to set the terms at a level that will encourage exploration companies to invest in exploration in the Irish offshore.</p><p>  While I will keep the licensing terms under review in light of relevant future developments, at this point in time, I believe that the focus should remain on attracting a greater share of international exploration investment to Ireland in order to increase the chances of new commercial discoveries being made.</p></reply>

Providence Resources and partners have a drilling commitment on their petroleum exploration licence in the Kish Bank Basin off the Dublin\Wicklow coast.</p><p>  I am aware of booklet entitled <i>&#8220;Liquid Assets - Ireland&#8217;s oil and gas resources and how they could be managed for the peoples benefit&#8221;</i>   produced by the Dublin Shell to Sea Campaign.  While the booklet addresses a number of discrete topics related to exploration for and production of oil and gas, its principal focus is on how Ireland should get best value from its natural resources going forward.</p><p>  A key element of the analysis relates to the 21 billion barrels of oil equivalent resource potential identified in the booklet.  While the authors acknowledge that this estimate, which is based inter alia on various company media releases of potential resources, might not be entirely accurate, it is still relied on in the booklet in the way &#8220;proven reserves&#8221; would be used to inform public policy decisions.  The reality is that Ireland&#8217;s proven hydrocarbon resources to date amount to approximately 0.5 bboe and more than half of this has already been exploited.</p><p>  The Shell to Sea estimate of 21 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe) includes:</p><p>Over 8 bboe for two prospects in the Atlantic, neither of which have been drilled or even have a drilling commitment;</p><p>Almost another 1 bboe in relation to two prospects (Cashel and Blackrock), both of which when drilled produced were dry holes and both licences have since been relinquished;</p><p>Volumes of gas from the Kinsale area gas fields that have already been produced over the past three decades.</p><p>  While I welcome debate on how Ireland can get best value from its natural resources, I remain of the view that we are best served where that debate is grounded in fact and reality.</p></reply>

In the event that renewable power was being exported to the UK, for example, it would be necessary to ensure that the costs associated with new transmission infrastructure to export the power and the cost of a support scheme for renewable developers is paid for by UK consumers, rather than Irish consumers who would not be benefitting from either the power or the renewable value of the electricity.</p><p>  If the Irish Government decides to enter an Inter-Governmental agreement under the Directive with the UK or another Government, it will have to ensure sufficient return and benefits to the state from such projects.  This might include a share of the renewable value or the imposition of a royalty of some type.</p></reply>

Such an exercise would require the identification of reliable comparable data sets suitable for the precise purpose of understanding and explaining the relationship between the relevant fuel costs and electricity prices.  Suitable data sets are not readily available, particularly in the case of fuel costs.  Timeliness of available data is also an issue.  In the case of electricity prices, EU level data are only made available six months to a year after the period to which they relate.</p><p>  Since 2008, and every six months approximately, Eurostat publishes comparable data on electricity and gas prices for all EU states.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) publishes analyses of those Eurostat data twice a year.  The analysis is conducted by the Energy Policy Statistical Support Unit (EPSSU), the specialist statistical unit of SEAI and each price analysis publication covers a six month period (either January to June or July to December).</p><p>  SEAI analysis demonstrates that a number of factors influence energy prices in Ireland, and show how prices here compare with other EU countries.  These factors include, but are not limited to, imported fuel prices, energy infrastructure investment costs, Ireland&#8217;s electricity generating fuel mix and non-energy costs that affect energy prices (for example, taxes levied, employment costs, raw material and transport and shipping costs).</p><p>  The fuel mix for electricity generation has a key bearing on the variation in the price of electricity in different countries.  This is particularly significant in the case of an electricity fuel mix which relies to a significant extent on internationally traded fossil fuels, such as gas, oil and coal.  During periods of volatile price movements in these fuels there is a strong consequential knock-on impact on electricity prices in the short term.  Other factors that affect electricity prices include the level of competition in electricity generation and supply, labour costs, geographic isolation and the extent of population dispersal, taxation policy and the level of investment required in infrastructure to improve the transmission and distribution networks.</p><p>  According to the SEAI analysis Ireland has close to the highest overall dependency on fossil fuels for electricity generation across the EU at 78%, behind the Netherlands at 83%, Cyprus 98% and Malta at 100%.  Within the fossil fuel category, the analysis shows that Ireland additionally has a high dependency on gas in electricity generation, at 62%.  This is the third highest share of gas generation in electricity, behind Luxembourg at 64% and the Netherlands at 63%.</p><p>  Our heavy reliance on gas imported from the UK and traded in Sterling means that Irish electricity prices are susceptible to fluctuations in the wholesale cost of gas and in exchange rate movements.  According to the September 2012 Bord G&aacute;is Energy Index, in the 12 months to September 2012 the wholesale cost of natural gas has increased by 20% and the Euro has weakened by 7% compared to Sterling.  This will affect the cost of generating electricity in Ireland.</p><p>  The latest analysis of data published by Eurostat for electricity prices is published by the SEAI and covers the period July to December 2011.  This publication is available on the SEAI website:</p></reply>

The meeting provided the opportunity for very useful and informative discussion in regard to the Commission&#8217;s Report into the benefits of national gas infrastructure for the North West.  We also discussed the role of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the economic criteria governing the CER&#8217;s gas networks Connection to Towns policy.</p><p>  The CER is the statutory, independent body, charged with the assessment and licensing of prospective operators seeking to develop and operate a gas distribution system within the State.  I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p><p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p><p>  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Uneconomic projects would increase costs for all energy consumers.</p><p>Under the CER&#8217;s policy framework, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and latterly Gaslink carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  Gaslink published its New Towns Analysis Phase 3<i></i>report in 2010.</p><p>  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, &#8216;Why Invest in Gas&#8217;.  However, the Gaslink review found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.</p><p>Gaslink will continue to regularly review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the 2010 Study as well as other towns.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p></reply>

There have, however, been four discoveries in the Irish offshore during this time, namely the Hook Head and Barryroe oil discoveries in the Celtic sea, the Bandon oil discovery in the Slyne basin and the Schull gas discovery in the Celtic sea.  None of these discoveries has been declared commercial to date and tests are ongoing in order to determine if any of them can be declared commercial.</p><p>  All of these discoveries, other than the Barryroe discovery, were made pursuant to licences granted under the 1992 Licensing Terms, the Barryroe discovery was made pursuant to a licence granted under the 2007 licensing Terms.  The Licensing Terms provide inter alia for a Corporation tax on profits which is set down in the Finance Acts.  A basic tax rate of 25% applies to profits from oil and gas production. Following a review of the fiscal terms in 2007 the terms were revised to provide for a higher tax rate of up to 40% in the case of more profitable fields.  The revised terms apply to all discoveries pursuant to exploration licences granted since 1 January 2007.</p><p>   A commercial discovery would also strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s energy security of supply and associated development projects would be expected to stimulate a range of economic activity and give rise to job creation.</p><p>  There have been two commercial discoveries of natural gas over the last 20 years, namely the Seven Heads gas field in the Celtic sea and the Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo.  While the Seven Heads field has been developed and commercialised the Corrib field is still at the development stage with production expected to commence in late 2014.</p><p>  With regard to non-petroleum minerals, as of 30 September 2012, there are 606 active mineral prospecting licences currently held by 46 companies.</p><p>  In the past twenty years, the Galmoy and Lisheen zinc/lead mines have been successfully brought into production, and discoveries of additional reserves adjacent to Boliden Tara Mines Ltd&rsquo;s operations at Navan have extended the life of that mine.  While no new commercially viable deposits of minerals have been discovered in recent years, there have been some encouraging results, particularly in Counties Limerick and Clare.  However, it is too early to determine whether these results will lead to identification of commercially viable deposits or to estimate the economic benefits that might accrue.</p><p>Financial and other terms for State Mining Facilities (Lease or Licence, depending on ownership of minerals) are negotiated on a case by case basis, in accordance with the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999.  Receipts from State Mining Facilities are normally paid in the form of periodic royalties based on volume of production or revenue.  Output from base metal mines is exported to smelters abroad while industrial minerals, such as gypsum, are produced for the home market.</p></reply>

The organisation has experienced a significant drop in revenues over the last few years.  Its commercial revenue has fallen sharply and decisions taken in the December 2010 Budget substantially reduced its TV licence fee revenue.  I have, in my discussions with the Chairman and Director General, expressed my concern that those best able to contribute to savings should do so.  In addition, I should point out that in June of 2011, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, announced a &euro;200,000 pay ceiling for future appointments to higher positions across the public service which applies to all established RT&Eacute; and TG4 employees.  While this would not be applicable to contracted staff, the Director General of RT&Eacute; has made it clear that pay cuts of up to 30% shall apply to all contracted staff on renewal of their contracts.</p><p>  I should also point out that arising from a Government decision of June 2011, a general policy has been adopted that a salary ceiling of &euro;250,000 will apply to appointments of CEOs of Commercial State Bodies. This ceiling was applied in the case of the RT&Eacute; Director General on his appointment in February, 2011 prior to the Government decision. No performance related pay was awarded or paid to the Director-General since his appointment and his salary is at a lower level than his predecessor in the role whose salary was &euro;298,000 at January 1st 2009 and &euro;261,000 at January 1st  , 2010.</p></reply>

I decided further research was needed to take into account the recent National Digital Switchover Week which ran from September 17<sup>th</sup> &#8211; 23<sup>rd</sup>  .  The Week was organised by my Department in partnership with The Wheel and Irish Rural Link.  The Week saw 26 local Digital Outreach Champions across the country organise over 250 events in their communities to encourage those who have not yet switched to digital TV to do so.</p><p>  The most recent research was carried to take into account National Digital Switchover Week.  This research was carried out between 21<sup>st</sup> September and 3<sup>rd</sup>  October.  The findings show that: </p><p>  - The estimated number of households that need to switch in October is 100,000 down from 150,000 at mid September</p><p>  - There is now 99% awareness among analogue users</p><p>  - Minds are becoming more focussed as to the actual date &#8211; six in ten who are aware of the switchover nominate 24th October without being prompted.</p><p>Further findings are available on .

Part of that decision involved giving effect in legislation to the recommendations of the Report of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers, and to transfer responsibility for public interest considerations from the Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to myself.  A series of discussions were held at Ministerial and official level on this subject, both before and after the Government Decision, and contacts are ongoing on the matter.</p><p>  Primary responsibility for promulgating the Consumer and Competition Bill 2012 rests with the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.

The critical role of the media in our democracy, and the potentially harmful effects of an over concentration of media ownership, means that this issue is a vitally important one.  The Government remains committed to implementing a set of robust measures that allow for a transparent and objective assessment of the public good in media mergers cases, and to do so as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

In developing plans for the development of digital television in Ireland, my predecessor was cognisant that the UK was also upgrading their television services to digital.  Digital is more efficient than analogue TV.  It is capable of carrying many more TV channels.  In this regard and in order to provide for a coordinated approach to analogue switch off on both sides of the border relevant officials entered into discussions with their UK counterparts.</p><p>  As a result of these discussions, a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) was signed jointly by the UK and Irish Governments on 1<sup>st</sup> February 2010.  A copy of the MOU is available at   .</p><p>    The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is: </p><p>  1. To provide a mechanism for co-operation between the Governments of Ireland and UK in providing a framework for the transition to digital terrestrial television and analogue switch off.  </p><p>  2. To provide for TG4 to be carried in Northern Ireland on the digital TV network; </p><p>  3. To provide an opportunity for RT&Eacute; to be transmitted within Northern Ireland and for BBC to be transmitted in Ireland.</p><p>  In relation to TG4, the MOU draws on the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement 1998 and the 2006 St. Andrews Agreement which provided for the availability of TG4 throughout Northern Ireland over the analogue network.  The MOU extends this provision and secures the carriage of TG4 on the digital network in Northern Ireland.  In relation to RT&Eacute;, the MOU commits both Governments to seeking to find a technical and cost effective solution to the provision of RT&Eacute; throughout Northern Ireland.</p><p>  Since the MOU was signed, relevant Irish and UK officials and representatives from TG4 and RT&Eacute;, have continued to meet and to work together to provide for the full implementation of the MOU.  This work has led to an agreement on the provision of TG4, RT&Eacute; and Raidio na Gaeltachta on a special multiplex in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a company owned jointly by RT&Eacute; and TG4 to operate this multiplex.  This new multiplex, which will begin operation on 24<sup>th</sup>   October 2012- the date of Digital Switchover, provides 75% coverage within Northern Ireland.  When the coverage is combined with overspill of the Irish TV channels from Ireland, Northern Ireland will have 94% coverage of these Irish TV channels.  This is the first time in the history of broadcasting that RT&Eacute; and TG4 will be available throughout the island of Ireland.</p><p>  On the issue of BBC coverage within Ireland, this is a commercial matter for the BBC as, unlike RT&Eacute;, the BBC has no mandate to provide coverage within Ireland.  In this regard, my understanding is that, to date, the BBC has expressed no interest in being carried on SAORVIEW.  Notwithstanding, BBC programming is freely available throughout Ireland over satellite and is also available in border areas via terrestrial TV overspill from the UK and Northern Ireland.  Additionally, BBC is available on pay TV platforms in Ireland.</p></reply>

A number of factors, including environmental constraints on the use of peat in power generation and horticultural products and the expiry of the Public Service Obligation for peat-fired power generation in the coming years, will contribute to the already declining market for peat.</p><p>  The company has scoped out a new vision for the future sustainable development of Bord na M&oacute;na which is set out in its published &ldquo;A New Contract with Nature&rdquo; strategy, in order to meet the challenge of transitioning away from dependence on the declining market for peat and towards a more sustainable future.  This strategy leverages Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s landbank and the strength of its workforce to develop new businesses which will secure long-term employment in this important State company.</p><p>  The unparalleled weather conditions during the summer of 2012 resulted in only 35% - 40% of Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s expected harvest being secured.  The exceptionally poor peat harvest has created very significant financial challenges for the company not just in the current period but in the months and years ahead and highlights the importance of the company&rsquo;s ongoing diversification and growth strategy away from its core peat business.  Bord na M&oacute;na management has taken and continues to take decisive steps to manage this unprecedented situation in order to ensure the long-term viability of the company.  Bord na M&oacute;na and its employees, through its diversification strategy, have positioned the company to become a leading provider of sustainable solutions with particular potential in renewable power generation.

This includes information on transmitter sites being used.  This is in accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides that the development of the RT&Eacute; network is an operational matter for RT&Eacute;.  Section 130 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 Act provides that RT&Eacute; must roll out a national digital TV network to the same extent as its existing analogue network.  In this regard, I understand from RT&Eacute; that their analogue network covers 98% of the population and the Saorview network will also provide 98% population coverage.  It is impossible to cover 100% of the population by terrestrial means.</p><p>  The SAORVIEW network is largely completed.  Regarding cover in County Kerry I have been informed by RT&Eacute; Networks Limited (RT&Eacute;NL) that   <font color="#2F2F2F">SAORVIEW is a significant improvement over Analogue Terrestrial Television coverage in County Kerry as follows:</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">RT&Eacute; One analogue 90% population compared with SAORVIEW 95% - an increase of 5%</font></p><p>  RT&Eacute; Two Analogue 90% population compared with SAORVIEW 95% - an increase of 5%</p><p>  TV3 Analogue 44% population compared with SAORVIEW 95%- an increase of 51%</p><p>  TG4 Analogue 75% population compared with SAORVIEW 95% - an increase of 20%</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Geographical SAORVIEW coverage of Kerry is also far better than analogue was and is as follows: </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  RT&Eacute; One Analogue 75% area compared with SAORVIEW 87% - an increase of 12%</font></p><p>  RT&Eacute; Two Analogue 75% area compared with SAORVIEW 87% - an increase of  12%</p><p>  TV3 Analogue 40% area compared with SAORVIEW 87% - an increase of 47%</p><p>  TG4 Analogue 64% area compared with SAORVIEW 87% - an increase of 23%</p><p>  As I mentioned above it is simply not possible to provide 100% coverage by terrestrial means.  In relation to the specific areas as referenced, according to RT&Eacute;NL, because of local topography they are SAORVIEW challenged.  The information in relation to SAORVIEW coverage is on the SAORVIEW and RT&Eacute;NL web pages ( and ).  I would point out to the Deputy that these coverage maps are conservative and RT&Eacute;NL recommend people in these marginal areas talk to a competent local aerial installer.</p><p>  In addition to SAORVIEW RT&Eacute; has developed SAORSAT, a new free-to-air satellite service unique to Ireland to ensure the RT&Eacute; television services are available to the remaining 2% of the population.  RT&Eacute; is not obliged to provide this satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  I have been informed by RT&Eacute;NL that they arranged additional SAORSAT training for installers on Monday 1<sup>st</sup>   October. Ten installers attended a training course in Kerry.  The course was open to any installer and the ones that attended were from areas such as Firies, Killorglin, Kenmare, Killarney, Cahersiveen, Beaufort, Waterville and Castleisland.  The course showed, inter alia, the best dish type to use, how to attach the dish correctly and how to position it correctly.</p><p>  According to RT&Eacute;NL, the parameters for SAORSAT are a little bit tighter than installers would be used to with Sky or Freesat but a good SAORSAT installation is well within the capabilities of any competent installer.  Installers that are having difficulty installing SAORSAT should contact RT&Eacute;NL directly and RT&Eacute;NL will arrange the necessary training.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of these contacts has been to facilitate an exchange of information in relation to the nature of the activities that have been licensed and their associated timelines.  There has also been a sharing of information in relation to the regulatory processes that would apply in each jurisdiction should the promoters of these projects make applications to advance to an exploration drilling phase, or beyond. </p><p>  The focus of these preliminary engagements has been on information sharing and not on seeking to agree a joint north south policy. In the case that a project in either jurisdiction were to advance to the next stage then it would be subject to the regulatory processes that pertain in that jurisdiction.  It is the case, however, that the environmental consideration of any proposed project in either jurisdiction will be subject to EU environmental legislation, including the provisions relating to consultation across borders where there could be a potential negative environmental impact in a neighbouring jurisdiction.</p><p>  A meeting between authorities both north and south took place in February of this year, which provided an opportunity for a more detailed engagement and sharing of information between the respective regulators, together with a commitment to keep each other informed on relevant developments.  Additionally, officials from Northern Ireland are represented among the bodies engaged in scoping the more detailed research to be commissioned by the EPA later this year, on the potential environmental impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing.</p></reply>

Israel is an important trading partner and under its trade promotion strategy, the Government is committed to growing Ireland&rsquo;s exports in all foreign markets, and expanding our trade footprint outside our main trading partners.  It has been a long-standing position of successive governments that Ireland does not support trade sanctions or boycotts against Israel.   I believe, as have my predecessors that support for a policy of boycotts or sanctions would only weaken the weight carried by our views, both in Israel, where we seek to persuade, and among our European partners. </p><p>  I have recently answered a number of questions on the related but separate issue of the importation of products from illegal Israeli settlements.  Notwithstanding the EU&rsquo;s clear view on the illegality of Israel&rsquo;s settlement activity in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, there is, in my view, no prospect of securing agreement at EU level on the banning of products produced in the settlements from entering the European Union.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-11a.108.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101100041#WRD01500"><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax (Gift and Inheritance Tax), the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold- known as the &#8220;Group threshold&#8221; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.   There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>Group A: &#8364;250,000 </b>- applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>Group B: &#8364;33,500 &#8211;</b>  applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>Group C: &#8364;16,750</b>  -applies in all other cases. </p><p>  The Group A threshold of &#8364;250,000 applies to both gifts and inheritances taken by a child from a parent.  The Group A threshold also applies to inheritances taken by a parent from a child, where the inheritance is a full absolute interest in the inherited property and is not a limited interest (e.g. an interest in the inherited property for the life of the parent). The Group A threshold also applies where the inheritance taken by the parent is taken on the death of the child as opposed to, for example, an inheritance taken by the parent at a later date on the death of an intervening life tenant.</p><p>  Gifts by children to parents fall within the Group B tax-free threshold of &#8364;33,500.  Separately, Section 79 Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides that, subject to certain conditions, an inheritance taken by a parent from a child is completely exempt from Inheritance Tax and does not fall to be taken into account in calculating tax on later gifts or inheritances from any source. There are two conditions to be satisfied before the Inheritance Tax exemption is available: </p><p>  (i) the inheritance must be taken on the death of the child; and</p><p>  (ii) within the five year period prior to the death of the child, the child must have taken a taxable gift or inheritance from either or both of his/her parents.</p><p>  Where a beneficiary receives benefits in excess of his or her Group threshold, a 30% rate of Capital Acquisitions Tax applies on the difference. </p><p>  In summary, the Group A threshold of &#8364;250,000 applies to all gifts and inheritances taken by a child from a parent and equally applies also to all absolute inheritances taken by a parent from a child. Inheritances taken by a parent from a child may also qualify for complete exemption from Inheritance Tax where the inheritance taken is an absolute inheritance and where the child has taken a taxable gift or inheritance from either parent in the previous five years. </p></reply>

However, AIB has informed me that it has announced two variable mortgage interest rate increases in 2012.

The second increase of an additional 50bps to variable rates was announced on 3 October 2012, and will become effective from 13 November 2012. In addition the Bank did not pass on an ECB rate decrease of 25bps in July 2012, though this must be seen in the context of the two 25bps ECB rate increases in April and July 2011 that AIB did not pass on to mortgage customers.  </p><p>  AIB has also informed me that even following the recent increases, it will still continue to have the lowest mortgage rate in the Irish market. </p></reply>

However, the Government is aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. </p><p>  A number of significant milestones have now been achieved.  The Personal Insolvency Bill was approved by Government and published last June and the Committee stage of the Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il last month.  The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis.  Also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website<i> www.keepingyourhome.ie</i> (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie</i>   website.</p><p>  The Government remains very committed to progressing these measures, which are in addition to existing supports such as the protections afforded by the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government sub-committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet to ensure this receives priority attention across relevant Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

Principal contractors are defined in the legislation (section 530A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) as including &#8220;any board or body established by or under statute &#8230; and funded wholly or mainly out of funds provided by the Oireachtas&#8221;.  As such, school Boards of Management are principal contractors for the purposes of RCT.  Under VAT law, where a principal contractor (generally as defined for RCT purposes) receives services consisting of construction operations (again generally as defined for RCT purposes) the principal is an accountable person and is liable to pay the VAT chargeable on those services on a reverse charge basis.  In this regard, where a school Board of Management receives services consisting of construction operations the Board must register for VAT and account for VAT on the received services.</p><p>  I am also informed that Finance Act 2011 did not introduce any change in terms of the obligations of Boards of Management to operate RCT or VAT.  Nor did the Revenue Commissioners issue a directive in this regard.  Principal contractors, including school Boards of Management are, and always were, required to deduct tax from the payments made to subcontractors and pay it over to Revenue.  As it is recognised that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant subcontractors, provision is made for compliant subcontractors to receive payments without deduction of tax.  The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school Boards of Management and other principal contractors.  RCT and the VAT reverse charge system play an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.</p><p>  From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of RCT following the introduction of a dedicated online facility which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper free system.  This has streamlined the process for the submission of information and payments to Revenue and has had the effect of significantly reducing the administrative burden associated with RCT.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of the difficulty some school Boards of Management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT and VAT systems.  Revenue has met with the Department of Education and Skills regarding the obligations of Boards of Management under the RCT and VAT systems and has also met with representatives of some Boards of Management.  In addition, Revenue has participated in a series of seminars throughout the country during September/October 2012 organised by the<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>Joint Managerial Board in conjunction with the Catholic Primary School Management Association.  These seminars are aimed at school Principals, members of boards of management, bursars and secretarial/accounts personnel who are likely to be in receipt of State funding for construction projects with a view to assisting them with their RCT and VAT responsibilities.  Detailed guidance notes specifically tailored for school Boards of Management regarding the operation of RCT and VAT were made available by Revenue in July and the availability of these notes has been highlighted to the Boards of Management representative bodies.  They have been published on the Revenue website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  Finally, having regard to the pressures on the public finances, it is important that the RCT and VAT systems are implemented correctly in order to minimise tax evasion in the construction sector particularly where the project involves substantial State funding.  The new online system introduced by Revenue has significantly simplified the RCT process for principal contractors, including school Boards of Management.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters.  These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution.  Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  However, the Government is aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. </p><p>  A number of significant milestones have now been achieved:-</p><p> - The Personal Insolvency Bill was approved by Government and published last June and the Committee stage of the Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il last month; </p><p> - The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis;</p><p> - Also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website <i><i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i></i><i></i>(ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie</i> website.</p><p>  The Government remains very committed to progressing these measures, which are in addition to existing supports such as the protections afforded by the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government sub-committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet to ensure this receives priority attention across relevant Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

Following discussion with Kildare Revenue District, Revenue agreed to issue a tax clearance certificate for a period of three months, on foot of an interim instalment arrangement and a requirement that the taxpayer would regularise his tax affairs before the issue of a further tax clearance certificate.  Revenue issued a Tax Clearance Certificate valid for a period of three months on 15 June 2012.  This expired on 15 September 2012. </p><p>  The interim instalment arrangement which was agreed in June was not fully honoured by the taxpayer.  In addition, requests from the Collector-General for information in order to consider an instalment arrangement to fully address outstanding liabilities were not responded to in full.  Furthermore, there is no record of receipt of an application for a Tax Clearance Certificate since the expiry of the most recent certificate in September.</p><p>  The individual contacted Kildare Revenue District in the past week and tax clearance was discussed.

The Fund for Students with Disabilities provides funding to further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities.

Kildare VEC as a teacher where, for the remainder of the current school year (i.e. the 2012-13 school year), he will carry out principal duties in the school to which the Deputy refers, arising from a vacancy in the post of principal in that school.  My Department had separately indicated to the VEC that the filling of the vacancy through permanent recruitment should not apply pending the completion of an analysis of how the future education needs of the area would be planned for and met.</p></reply>

I intend to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the legislation currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice. It is hoped that this legislation will be published later this year.</p><p>  It is important to point out that in introducing a statutory Code the intention is not to protect one stakeholder over another nor is the Code intended to prevent stakeholders such as retailers and suppliers from engaging in robust contractual negotiations as happens in most other sectors of the economy. It is also the case that the Code is not seeking in any way to determine the price of grocery goods. Rather the essential value of the Code is that by regulating problematic practices in the grocery goods sector it seeks to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the various stakeholders including the interests of the end user, the consumer.</p><p>  The Government is strongly of the view that it important to ensure there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector and that Ireland continues to have robust agrifood and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy. The introduction of a Code of Practice, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector including the interests of the consumer and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing-on of lower prices to consumers.</p></reply>

The fundamental problem is that pensions are significantly more expensive due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflected in increased annuity rates.  </p><p>  The Pensions Regulator suspended the Funding Standard four years ago, following the downturn in the financial market, to give trustees/employers an opportunity to assess the impact on pension funds and to enable them to have sufficient time to develop responses to the challenge. The re-introduction of the Funding Standard was delayed on a number of occasions pending changes to legislation which were designed to help trustees respond to the funding challenges facing pension schemes. Among the measures introduced at that time was the provision for sovereign annuities. This provides pension scheme trustees with an option of purchasing annuities, which will have the effect of reducing pensioner liabilities under the Funding Standard, sovereign annuity products are now available and it is expected that the range of products will grow over the coming months.</p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of a scheme can be tested. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed. However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.</p><p>  The requirement for a risk reserve is being introduced to provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is accepted that the requirements for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes. However, guidance issued by the regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023.  </p><p>  Reference has been made to the easing of the solvency regime in a number of other countries. It should be noted that the solvency regime even after those changes is still more onerous that the current Irish regime. It should be noted that the changes to the Funding Standard are being implemented over the next 11 years, not immediately. This is the longest recovery period generally allowed in any European country.</p><p>  The Pensions Board recently announced that the timeframe for pension schemes to submit funding proposals has been extended to 30 June 2013. This extension will give schemes additional time to help them address the issues they are facing.</p><p>  Overall the changes made to defined benefit schemes are intended to bring increased stability to pension promises in the future and lessen schemes&rsquo; exposure to risks.</p></reply>

Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;35 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.</p><p>  As part of the assessment of means for rent supplement, capital (savings and investments) and the value of property owned but not personally used or enjoyed are assessed as means. Where capital or property is assessed on this basis, any income received from its use (e.g. interest on savings, dividends from shares, rent from property let) is not assessed as cash income. Instead, the following formula is used to establish weekly means:</p><p>  - Disregard first &euro;5,000 of capital value of property/savings</p><p>  - Assess next &euro;10,000 @ &euro;1 per &euro;1,000</p><p>  - Assess next &euro;25,000 @ &euro;2 per &euro;1,000</p><p>  - Assess remaining capital over &euro;40,000 @ &euro;4 per &euro;1,000.</p><p>  The amount of rent supplement is determined by not only the person&rsquo;s savings, but also includes factors such as earnings, household composition and the local rent limits in force. In this regard, it is not possible to specify an amount of savings that a person could have and still qualify for a rent supplement payment without an understanding of the person&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p></reply>

In 2011 expenditure on FIS amounted to almost &euro;205 million in respect of some 29,000 families.  </p><p>  The FIS payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments. To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least three months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. </p><p>  There are no plans to extend FIS to self-employed persons at the present time.  There are a number of factors that would have to be taken in to account in any consideration of extending eligibility criteria for family income supplement to include self-employed persons. There would be considerable practical difficulties in defining and controlling an alternative to the hours worked condition it would be impossible to establish satisfactorily their eligibility and their hours of employment would be difficult to establish and certify on an ongoing basis.  Furthermore, the cost of extending the scheme to the self-employed would be considerable. Such a consideration would also need to take into account the fact that there are already arrangements in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as through jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and through farm assist for low-income farmers.  </p><p>  An extension of the FIS scheme would in effect change the nature of the scheme and it would not be feasible or desirable to extend FIS to the self-employed in its current form.  </p><p>  Nonetheless, I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including the family income supplement payment, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been asked to recommend cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012.</p><p>  As the Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions. New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These new limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. </p><p>  Approximately 45,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, representing 50% of total claims in payment, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the existing rent limits. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p><p>  It is my intention to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer, on which my Department is represented. This will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short term income support payment for those temporarily unemployed. </p><p>  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits. Any changes to the rent supplement scheme will be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

BTEA guidelines are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for similar student supports administered by the Department of Education and Skills and require student progression from one qualification level to a higher one.

I acknowledge there is a considerable amount of money being spent by the public sector each year on energy but whether a saving of &#8364;100m in two years is achievable as the report suggests, in light of the challenging economic environment, remains to be seen.  There are a number of plans and support schemes already in place but there is more that could be done.  Reduction in spend over the longer term requires sustained cross-Departmental action and procurement is one of the best levers at our disposal to achieve significant savings in the short to medium term.</p><p>  The current National Energy Efficiency Action Plan was published in May 2009, and outlined the framework for delivering Ireland's energy efficiency targets by 2020.  The second Action Plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy savings targets implemented under current EU requirements as well as energy efficiency policy priorities between now and 2020.  The Action Plan will show that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy saving target.</p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &#8364;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving our 33% savings target for the public sector would save &#8364;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  This year the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies, including schools and healthcare facilities, to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.</p><p>  My Department and the SEAI have also established a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  Last month I wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI. Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: 'Energy Use in the Public Sector', which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.</p><p>  Finally, the recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive will translate elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, including an annual rate of renovation for central Government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central Government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; and an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance.  The 3% renovation target for central Government buildings represents a challenge for the Office of Public Works (OPW), however the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  We will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.</p></reply>

However, I understand that a proposal relating to the use of certain biofuels will be circulated to Member States in the coming weeks.  Once I receive this, I will consider its implications for renewable energy policy and the further development of a sustainable biofuel sector in Ireland.  Such considerations will inform Ireland's position with respect to the proposed amendments.  Currently the EU Renewable Energy Directive requires Member States to meet a target of 10% of renewable energy in transport by 2020.  The Directive also specifies a set of sustainability criteria that must be applied to biofuels, before they can be counted towards a Member State's renewable energy transport target.  Under these criteria biofuels may not be made from raw materials originating from tropical forests or recently deforested areas, drained peatland, wetland or highly biodiverse areas.</p><p>  Ireland will meet its renewable energy target in transport primarily through the use of biofuels and the Government intends to meet the obligation under the Renewable Energy Directive through progressively increasing sustainable biofuel penetration combined with an increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads towards the end of the decade.  The requirement that biofuels used in meeting Ireland's obligation comply with the Directive's sustainability criteria is legislated for in the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, as amended by the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 and set out in detail in European Union (Biofuel Sustainability Criteria) Regulations 2012.</p><p>  In 2011, approximately 2.7% of the energy in road transport came from biofuels.  Of these biofuels, over one third was produced from wastes, accounting for 1.11% of the energy used in road transport in 2011.  Biofuels from wastes or residues would not be affected by any limit imposed on the use of crop-based biofuel.  There is also significant research being undertaken in Ireland and internationally on the development of second generation biofuels, which are not using food based raw materials as input.</p></reply>

The International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advice is that the eel stock continued to decline in the period 2009 to 2011 and urgent action is needed.  In 2011 ICES reiterated its previous advice that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) affecting production and escapement of eels should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing.  In 2011, glass eel recruitment has fallen to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.  In Ireland, recruitment has been declining at many monitoring sites since the mid-1980s, for example in the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 numbers.  In summary, recruitment of glass eels and elvers remained low during the 2009 to 2011 period both in Ireland and across Europe.</p><p>  In Ireland it is anticipated that there will be a considerable decline in silver eel production, as indicated by recruitment history, yellow eel stock indicators and modelled projections for index stocks.  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s eel management regime, every three years, a review of the status of eel stocks is conducted, this coupled with input from stakeholders, supports the decision making process on the future of the commercial and recreational eel fishery.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has just completed a full public consultation on the future of the commercial and recreation eel fishery; the recommendations from this review are being finalised.  In that regards the issuing of licences to fish for eel is not possible at this time.</p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland has made a number of reports on eel stocks available on its website including The National Eel Stock Recovery Plan, The Status of Eel Stocks in Ireland and The Implementation of the Eel Management Plan for Ireland.  The review of eel stocks in Europe is a shared concern involving many countries on a pan European basis and it is likely that a summary of all European reviews will not be available for some time.</p><p>  In 2009 the then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland &ndash; IFI) engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes.  I understand that a number of former eel fishermen were contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.  There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation does not arise, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  Given that context and having regard to national economic circumstances, no provision has been made for compensation payments.</p></reply>

The licence is held by a consortium comprising Providence Resources Plc and PSE Seven Heads Limited.  The award of this exploration licence confers on the holder the exclusive right to search for petroleum in the licensed area, but does not confer a right to produce/extract petroleum.  The licence was granted for a six-year period and includes an obligation to drill an exploration well by August 2014.  While my Department has not as yet received a detailed application from Providence Resources for approval to drill on the licence, I am aware that environmental and safety concerns have been raised about the proximity of the proposed well to the coast.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that drilling operators are required to comply with best international practice when carrying out drilling operations offshore Ireland and that my Department will only give an approval to drill once it is satisfied that drilling operations can be carried out in a safe manner and without negative social or environmental impact.  In this regard, Licence holders are required to engage a competent Independent Well Examiner to verify the safety of all drilling rigs, drilling equipment, pressure containment systems and drilling processes in advance of and during drilling operations.  The well examiner has a role for as long as drilling operations continue and is required to verify any changes to drilling plans.  Ongoing monitoring by the Independent Well Examiner, my Department&rsquo;s Advisers and my Department&rsquo;s technical specialists continues throughout the drilling of a well.  In the event that the exploration activity under this licence resulted in a commercial discovery and a petroleum production project, the licensees would require a number of statutory approvals which would include a full public consultation phase.</p><p>  With regards to the Joint Committee&rsquo;s report on offshore oil and gas exploration, I am sure the report will make a valuable contribution to the debate on how we should manage our indigenous oil and gas resources for the benefit of the people of Ireland.  In relation to taxation, the report recognises there is a balance to be struck between maximising revenue to the State and incentivising companies to invest in exploration in the Irish offshore.  The report goes on to recommend that the rate of tax applying to petroleum production in Ireland should be increased to between 40% and 80%, depending on the profitability of the field.  It seems that factors such as high oil prices and advances in exploration technology were key considerations influencing this recommendation.  However, high oil prices will not make Ireland any more or less attractive as a location for investment, compared to other countries with oil and gas potential.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s petroleum potential is largely unproven and this is likely to remain the case until there is a significant increase in the level of exploration activity from the current low level of exploration drilling.  At this point, I remain to be convinced how doubling the maximum tax rate would help attract much needed exploration investment to Ireland but I have committed to engaging with the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications on the Report prepared by the committee.</p></reply>

I am advised that a recent EU Commission  update on the MoU reports that 90% of new models placed on the market offer the common charging capability and  that the Commission is continuing to pursue manufacturers to  achieve full compliance.</p></reply>

These benefits will only be realised through effective exploration.  Ireland has a policy of actively encouraging investment by relevant companies in exploration for oil and gas, both offshore and onshore.  Where exploration or production takes place, it is subject to a robust regulatory framework, with a clear objective of ensuring that all exploration and production activities are carried out in a safe manner and without significant environmental or social impact.</p><p>  I am very conscious that some concerns have been strongly expressed that use of the technology known as hydraulic fracturing in exploration and production activities, could have a negative impact on the environment.  The principal concerns that have been expressed relate to the production phase of a project and environmental considerations arising from the large number of production wells that may be hydraulically fractured.  In February of last year, my Department granted onshore Licensing Options to three companies over parts of the Lough Allen and Clare Basin respectively.  The Licensing Options are preliminary authorisations and are different to exploration licences.  The Options are for a two year period from 1 March 2011.  During this period, the companies will evaluate the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on studies of existing data.  Exploration drilling is not permitted under these authorisations.</p><p>  It is too early to say if any of the existing onshore licensing options will even progress to the exploration phase, let alone to a production phase, however, the statutory framework that would apply to such an application is the framework that is already in use in the case of a range of major strategic infrastructure projects.  Under that framework a developer would require consents from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This would result in a consideration of the potential environmental impact of any proposed petroleum production project, subject to EU environmental Directives, including the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which requires full public consultation.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in May of this year the Environmental Protection Agency published its preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction in the form of a small desk based study, which was carried out by the University of Aberdeen.  The study provides an introduction to the environmental aspects of fracking including a review of regulatory approaches used in other countries and areas for further investigation and research such as geological principles of relevance in fracking and shale gas extraction, potential environmental impacts and establishing best environmental practice.  While the study is a preliminary study it will inform the development of the terms of reference for a much more detailed research study to be commissioned by the EPA later this year.  The terms of reference for this more extensive research are currently being drawn up by a steering group including representatives from the EPA and my Department.</p><p>  The outcome of the further research to be commissioned by the EPA will assist in a robust scientific based assessment of any future application proposing the use of this technology.  I can confirm, however, that until there has been time to consider the second stage of the EPA research, the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling will not be authorised.  My policy approach is therefore one of encouraging investment in exploration, while ensuring all exploration and production activities are carried out in a safe manner and without significant adverse environmental or social impact.</p></reply>

The telephony market is served by a variety of commercial fixed line, wireless and mobile providers.  The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives in the provision of broadband to bring service to those parts of the country where operators have not offered services on a commercial basis.  In the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), for example, services are available from the NBS service provider, 3, in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) where a lack of broadband access had been identified.  Ireland is already ahead of the EU Commission&#8217;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  There has also been progress in the commercial telecommunications sector. Competition, technological innovation and consumer pressure has increased the contracted broadband speeds available and has brought down some prices for broadband, voice, data and bundled services.  Broadband, for example has entry level packages starting from &#8364;10 - &#8364;15 per month.  Consumers who are looking to get broadband or other telecommunications services or get better value through an alternative provider can find this information through ComReg&#8217;s independent price comparison website .</p><p>  Progress is also being achieved in terms of broadband speeds and in the number of broadband customers.  At end June 2012 the proportion of all residential customers  contracted at speeds below 2 megabits per second (Mbps)  fell to approximately 5% compared to 13% in June 2010 and 48% in June 2008, as the total number of contracted broadband users increased from 1m in June 2008 to 1.5m in June 2010 and 1.65m in June 2012.</p><p>  The Government&#8217;s recently-published National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  In addition, ComReg is currently in the process of awarding spectrum rights of use across three critical bands &#8211; the 800Mhz, 900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands &#8211; for the period 2013 to 2030.  This award process is a vital step in allowing for the next generation of advanced mobile services to be made available for Irish consumers and businesses from next year.</p></reply>

In the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), for example, services are available from the NBS service provider, 3, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) where a lack of broadband access had been identified.  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS), which was launched last year, is bringing commercial services to areas that were until recently unable to receive a broadband service, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  With the completion of the RBS programme later this year, Ireland will have met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas ahead of the 2013 deadline.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently-published National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:</p><p>  - 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>  - At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and </p><p>  - A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The precise areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this task.  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take several months to complete and until then the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  Rollout will be targeted to commence in 2014, when the mapping, State Aids and procurement processes are complete and when the current contract for the National Broadband Scheme expires.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including rural or remote parts of the country, have access to modern high speed broadband services.</p></reply>

Licences to provide mobile telephony services are granted by ComReg pursuant to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, as amended, and have been issued to the following Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), Vodafone, O2, Meteor and H3GI.</p><p>  These licences, among other things, require MNOs to provide a minimum level of national population coverage and quality of service.  However, the design of the network is a matter entirely for the relevant operator.  In practice in all cases networks exceed the minimum stipulated coverage and quality of service requirements for commercial reasons.  Compliance with licence requirements is assessed by means of a bi-annual drive testing programme conducted by ComReg.</p><p>  I am advised by ComReg that there are four MNOs providing commercial third generation (3G) mobile services in the Irish market.  As well as the four MNOs currently offering services, Vodafone, O2, Meteor and H3GI, there are also a number of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) in Ireland who have entered into commercial wholesale network access arrangements with MNOs which permit them to offer their own branded 3G retail mobile services to customers such as Tesco Mobile Ireland, Postfone and Lycamobile.  These 3G services compare favourably with the technology deployed in other markets, pending the wider future roll out internationally of  the next generation, 4G, networks. </p><p>  In Ireland, ComReg is currently in the process of awarding spectrum rights of use across three critical bands &ndash; the 800Mhz, 900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands &ndash; for the period 2013 to 2030.  This award process is a vital step in allowing for the next generation of advanced mobile services to be made available for Irish consumers and businesses from next year.</p><p>  It should be noted that the Universal Service Obligation (USO) to ensure nationwide access to basic standard telecommunications services relates to the provision of such services at fixed locations or premises only.  This obligation is currently addressed to eircom using fixed lines or equivalent connections to connect premises at fixed locations where no other service provider will do so, on a commercial basis.</p></reply>

Ensuring a continued positive impact across the Community and Voluntary sector will remain a key part of my Department&rsquo;s work in the coming years.  As well as funding the local Volunteer Centres, my Department also funds Volunteer Ireland which was founded in 2011 following the amalgamation of Volunteer Centres Ireland and Volunteer Ireland.  Volunteer Ireland facilitates and promotes the services offered by the local Volunteer Centres.  Its role is also to develop best practice within and across the Volunteer Centres and, it co-ordinates a national programme of volunteer management training that is delivered locally via the Volunteer Centres.</p><p>My Department seeks to encourage and support the spirit of volunteerism, which has resulted in much good work here and abroad.  The implementation of measures to encourage volunteering will continue to be an important element of the work of my Department.</p></reply>

The assessment of higher value projects (projects with a grant approval of &#8364;150,000 or more) usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company. It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications. It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme. These assessments also consider whether the project as proposed addresses the needs of the local community in the best possible way. A full and detailed assessment of all projects is essential. Currently, LEADER activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 85% and, accordingly, come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded by the LEADER companies.</p><p>  My Department currently has thirty eight projects at various stages of assessment, with an amount of &#8364;14.7 million in total project costs and &#8364;9.6 million in grant aid requested on hand.</p><p>  A substantial number of those projects have been received since June 2012; however, in relation to a small number there has been ongoing correspondence with the LAGs concerned for some time.</p><p><font color="#111111">  The policy in my Department is to work with the Local Development Companies to ensure that the projects submitted are fully compliant and can be approved rather than to refuse approval for funding and it can therefore take some time to come to a final conclusion.  My Department will continue to work with the relevant LAGs to make a full assessment of the eligibility of these projects and will inform the LAGs once all queries have been addressed satisfactorily.</font></p></reply>

The policy contains measures to ensure that the management of waste will be in accordance with the waste hierarchy, as set out in the Waste Framework Directive, whereby prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery are favoured to the disposal of waste. Maximising the resources recovered from waste is a central principle of the policy.</p><p>  Under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, financing the environmentally sound management of waste electrical and electronic equipment, including recycling, is solely a producer responsibility. Waste destined for recovery/recycling is, subject to environmental controls, a freely tradable commodity and cannot be directed into indigenous facilities. Approved bodies are however required to consider the impact their operations have on climate change, on the reduction of greenhouse gases by minimising transport and how Ireland can secure credit for savings in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that derive from recycling activity. It is my understanding that part of the business strategies of both Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment compliance schemes, WEEE Ireland and ERP Ireland, is to provide commercially viable solutions for their members that support local service providers for the treatment of WEEE wherever possible. </p><p>  The Government&#8217;s new waste policy contains measures to improve the quality of recycling and resource recovery from waste and thus provide greater opportunities for Irish industry to exploit this resource. While we must accept that our relative size will place some limits on the scope for a comprehensive recycling infrastructure, I fully support efforts to reduce our dependence on overseas recycling operations and provide local facilities with local employment that can provide cost effective solutions to WEEE producers. </p><p>  To this end, as part of the review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) agreements, I have requested an examination of all further measures which could be undertaken to support the development of indigenous reprocessing capacity for PRI waste, as well as the issue of a reuse policy for Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Reuse, and the preparation for reuse of Electrical and Electronic Equipment, has the potential to deliver environmental, economic and social benefits. This review is at an advanced stage and I look forward to considering its recommendations with regard to the development of an indigenous recycling industry that respects the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency. </p></reply>

The corresponding FTE figure at the end of 2008 was 740 which represents a reduction of over 23% in staff numbers working on immigration related functions.</p><p>  Through efficient and effective redeployment of staff and operating within the terms of the Croke Park Agreement, INIS has been able to absorb this reduction in overall staff numbers while maintaining a balanced and appropriate level of staff resources in priority areas.  For example, since the end of 2008 the total number of staff assigned to the asylum determination bodies (ORAC and RAT) has been reduced by over 50% reflecting the decreasing number of new asylum applications.  However, other areas of INIS have experienced huge increases in application volumes, particularly in the citizenship and EU Treaty Rights areas where new applications per year have significantly increased and in some instances, this has more than doubled.</p><p>  In addition, a number of staff of INIS have been allocated to certain immigration functions in Dublin Airport as part of the pilot project to assign civilian staff to border control duties thus freeing up Garda&iacute; for operational duties.  Further significant civilianisation and replacement of Garda&iacute; in this area is also planned.</p></reply>

It was decided at that time that, given the resources of the Air Corps and the demands on their services at home, that the Air Corps would not be deployed on overseas operations.  However, that decision did not preclude individual members of the Air Corps being deployed on overseas peace support operations. During the past five years (01 October 2007 to 30 September 2012) a total of 160 deployments of Air Corps personnel to overseas missions occurred (see table below).  It is my intention that Air Corps personnel will continue to be offered the opportunity of overseas service.  In that regard, the Deputy may wish to note that as part of the new agreement on NCO promotions, a provision was inserted which is designed to deliver increased opportunities for Air Corps personnel to serve overseas as part of Defence Forces contingents.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>MISSION</div></th><th><div>OFFICERS</div></th><th><div>ENLISTED PERS</div></th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>EUFOR (EU-led Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina)</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>EUFOR TCHAD/RCA (EU-led Operation in CHAD and the Central African  Republic)</td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>52</div></td><td><div>52</div></td></tr><tr><td>EU Military Staff (Brussels)</td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>EUTM Somalia (EU-led Training Mission in Uganda)  </td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>ISAF (International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan)</td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>KFOR (International Security Presence in Kosovo)</td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td>MINURCAT (United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad)</td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>46</div></td><td><div>46</div></td></tr><tr><td>MONUC (United Nations Mission in Democratic Republic of Congo)</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>OSCE Mission to Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon)</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>UNOCI (United Nations Mission in Ivory Coast)</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation) &#8211; Israel, Syria and Lebanon</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>151</div></td><td><div>160</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition, a review system has been put in place whereby personnel who are unhappy with a proposed relocation can seek a review of a decision in this regard.  While the maintenance of Defence Forces operational requirements must be prioritised within the reorganisation implementation process, within that context, all practical alternatives, including redeployment within an individual&rsquo;s existing location will be explored to minimise the requirement for geographic relocation.  Opportunities will also be given for personnel to retrain and re-skill so as to be able to fill vacancies in their current locations, and this is being incorporated into the Defence Forces Training directive for 2013. However, it must be accepted that there is no painless way to fundamentally reorganise the Defence Forces whilst maintaining essential military capabilities and, undoubtedly, it will be necessary to mandatorily move some personnel whose units are being disbanded or relocated and who cannot be accommodated in their current location.</p><p>  This is a difficult process for many serving members of the Defence Forces, officers and enlisted personnel, who are being required to make decisions under the current reorganisation which they would not otherwise make or in different times have had to consider. However, this is the reality of the public service today and of the reforms taking place across the public service. </p></reply>

The European Commission adopted the implementing rules for Control Regulation in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011. These regulations set out the detailed requirements and obligations for the operation of an EU Electronic Logbooks (ERS) system and the procedures to be adhered to in the event that the system is not fully functioning.</p><p>  The introduction of ERS allows the Irish Fisheries Control Authority near real time access to the fishing logbook information of EU and Third Country fishing vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone. This data is made available by the Flag Member State on request when the fishing vessel is fishing in Irish waters or is provided on landing into an Irish port.</p><p>  With the advent of ERS the Sea Fisheries Protection Authorities (SFPA) have been working with the Control Authorities of the Member States whose vessels operate in Irish Waters to provide that the relevant ERS data is made available through the European Commission Data Exchange Highway (DEH). The DEH is the channel through which Member States exchange ERS data and Ireland has been connected to the DEH since 2011. This process involves a significant amount of testing between all the relevant parties to ensure the logbook data exchange can take place and it is only when the testing is completed satisfactorily that data is allowed to be exchanged in the &ldquo;Live&rdquo; environment. At present Ireland is conducting testing with the Spanish Authorities on the exchange of ERS data through the DEH and significant progress has been made to date.</p><p>  In the meantime, there remain obligations on all Member States, including Spain, to provide Ireland with ERS logbook data by alternate means. Following several bilateral meetings the Irish and Spanish Authorities have put a system in place that allows for the exchange of logbook data between both parties to ensure that the logbook data required under the EU Regulation is available in near real time. This alternative system involves the direct exchange of logbook data between the Irish and Spanish Fisheries Monitoring Centres rather than using the DEH. In effect this means that the fishing logbook information of all Spanish fishing vessels operating in the Irish EEZ or landing into Irish Ports is available to the Irish Authorities electronically on request in near real time. While this alternative system is of practical use, Ireland continues to work closely with the authorities of Spain to ensure the full system is in place as early as possible.</p></reply>

It is widespread throughout much of Europe, where it has caused significant damage in recent years. The disease is currently not regulated under the EU Plant Health Directive. </p><p>  The Forestry Inspectorate in my Department has been carrying out surveys for the disease to determine its status in Ireland and has also been monitoring imports of ash plants, and wood products.  Every year many thousands of ash plants are imported for utilisation under the Department&#8217;s afforestation scheme and for other purposes.  </p><p>  I can confirm that Ireland has raised the issue at EU level under the Standing Committee on Plant Health. Due to the serious nature of this disease, it is my intention to introduce emergency measures following due process under the EU Plant Health Directive. It is likely that legislation would be introduced by Statutory Instrument that would require that any ash plants imported into the country would come from an area known to be free of the disease.  This would be regulated under the EU Plant Passport system.  In addition, my Department is working closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in order to jointly co-ordinate an all island approach to tackling the disease as we currently share a harmonised plant health legislative status.</p></reply>

On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.</p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas will inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy, identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. </p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will ultimately lead to an end to discarding.   </p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  </p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. </p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  </p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. There were 6,259 children in the care of the state in July 2012, the vast majority of whom were in foster care (5,725) and general residential care (351).</p><p>  A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability.

Unfortunately, it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of reimbursable items.  This includes gluten-free products.</p><p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link: .  Separate application forms are available for children. </p><p>  For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p></reply>

There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure.  In the short term, to address the 2012 position, I have instructed the Executive to impose cash limits on agency and overtime.  Furthermore, there will be more intensive management of absenteeism, travel and subsistence will be limited, and there will be more intensive management of stocks in order to better manage cash.  Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget, including the use of capital to fund revenue and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis.</p><p>  I have instructed the Executive to provide fortnightly reports on the cash situation, and the Regional Directors are being required to more intensively manage the cash so as to achieve a balanced vote.  On a strategic level my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to address concerns around financial control in the HSE.  These included engaging an expert from the UK NHS to examine the financial management of the HSE and make recommendations regarding strengthening and improving the management of its finances.  PA Consultancy has been engaged to prepare an Action Plan for implementation of these recommendations, and this report is due in my Department shortly.  In addition, a new Director General Designate has taken up position in the HSE and has been given a clear mandate in respect of controlling expenditure this year and putting forward proposals that deal with the challenge in 2013 and beyond.</p><p>  My Department is working intensively with the HSE on proposals for submission to Government to address structural expenditure issues in the context of the 2013 Estimates.  This includes reconfiguration of services, maximising the potential for flexibility under the Croke Park Agreement and curtailing expenditure in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.</p><p>  This is entirely appropriate and in keeping with the focus in the Programme for Government on reforming the way health services are funded and delivered to achieve greater productivity and more cost effective services.</p></reply>

This will complement the measures already in place. However, I do not have any plans, in the context of GDL, for specific off-road lessons at this time. </p></reply>

The European Commission adopted the implementing rules for Control Regulation in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011. These regulations set out the detailed requirements and obligations for the operation of an EU Electronic Logbooks (ERS) system and the procedures to be adhered to in the event that the system is not fully functioning.</p><p>  The introduction of ERS allows the Irish Fisheries Control Authority near real time access to the fishing logbook information of EU and Third Country fishing vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries Zone. This data is made available by the Flag Member State on request when the fishing vessel is fishing in Irish waters or is provided on landing into an Irish port.</p><p>  With the advent of ERS the Sea Fisheries Protection Authorities (SFPA) have been working with the Control Authorities of the Member States whose vessels operate in Irish Waters to provide that the relevant ERS data is made available through the European Commission Data Exchange Highway (DEH). The DEH is the channel through which Member States exchange ERS data and Ireland has been connected to the DEH since 2011. This process involves a significant amount of testing between all the relevant parties to ensure the logbook data exchange can take place and it is only when the testing is completed satisfactorily that data is allowed to be exchanged in the &ldquo;Live&rdquo; environment. At present Ireland is conducting testing with the Spanish Authorities on the exchange of ERS data through the DEH and significant progress has been made to date.</p><p>  In the meantime, there remain obligations on all Member States, including Spain, to provide Ireland with ERS logbook data by alternate means. Following several bilateral meetings the Irish and Spanish Authorities have put a system in place that allows for the exchange of logbook data between both parties to ensure that the logbook data required under the EU Regulation is available in near real time. This alternative system involves the direct exchange of logbook data between the Irish and Spanish Fisheries Monitoring Centres rather than using the DEH. In effect this means that the fishing logbook information of all Spanish fishing vessels operating in the Irish EEZ or landing into Irish Ports is available to the Irish Authorities electronically on request in near real time. While this alternative system is of practical use, Ireland continues to work closely with the authorities of Spain to ensure the full system is in place as early as possible.</p></reply>

It is widespread throughout much of Europe, where it has caused significant damage in recent years. The disease is currently not regulated under the EU Plant Health Directive. </p><p>  The Forestry Inspectorate in my Department has been carrying out surveys for the disease to determine its status in Ireland and has also been monitoring imports of ash plants, and wood products.  Every year many thousands of ash plants are imported for utilisation under the Department&#8217;s afforestation scheme and for other purposes.  </p><p>  I can confirm that Ireland has raised the issue at EU level under the Standing Committee on Plant Health. Due to the serious nature of this disease, it is my intention to introduce emergency measures following due process under the EU Plant Health Directive. It is likely that legislation would be introduced by Statutory Instrument that would require that any ash plants imported into the country would come from an area known to be free of the disease.  This would be regulated under the EU Plant Passport system.  In addition, my Department is working closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in order to jointly co-ordinate an all island approach to tackling the disease as we currently share a harmonised plant health legislative status.</p></reply>

The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.</p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas will inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy, identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. </p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will ultimately lead to an end to discarding.   </p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  </p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. </p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  </p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. There were 6,259 children in the care of the state in July 2012, the vast majority of whom were in foster care (5,725) and general residential care (351).</p><p>  A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability. The care needs of these young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland. </p><p>  There are three designated special care units in the country where children are detained on order of the high court for their own safety. There is a unit in Ballydowd in Dublin, which has a capacity of 10 beds, another in Gleann &Aacute;lainn in Cork with a capacity of 4 beds and Coovagh House in Limerick with a capacity capped at 2 for the present time following refurbishment of the unit.</p><p>  Additionally, there are two National High Support Units in Ireland, Rath Na n&Oacute;g in Castleblaney and Crann&oacute;g Nua in Portrane. Currently there is a total </p><p>capacity of 10 beds in these two units.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive is currently implementing a capital investment programme to expand the capacity of the national high support and special care service.</p></reply>

There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure.  In the short term, to address the 2012 position, I have instructed the Executive to impose cash limits on agency and overtime.  Furthermore, there will be more intensive management of absenteeism, travel and subsistence will be limited, and there will be more intensive management of stocks in order to better manage cash.  Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget, including the use of capital to fund revenue and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis.</p><p>  I have instructed the Executive to provide fortnightly reports on the cash situation, and the Regional Directors are being required to more intensively manage the cash so as to achieve a balanced vote.  On a strategic level my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to address concerns around financial control in the HSE.  These included engaging an expert from the UK NHS to examine the financial management of the HSE and make recommendations regarding strengthening and improving the management of its finances.  PA Consultancy has been engaged to prepare an Action Plan for implementation of these recommendations, and this report is due in my Department shortly.  In addition, a new Director General Designate has taken up position in the HSE and has been given a clear mandate in respect of controlling expenditure this year and putting forward proposals that deal with the challenge in 2013 and beyond.</p><p>  My Department is working intensively with the HSE on proposals for submission to Government to address structural expenditure issues in the context of the 2013 Estimates.  This includes reconfiguration of services, maximising the potential for flexibility under the Croke Park Agreement and curtailing expenditure in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.</p><p>  This is entirely appropriate and in keeping with the focus in the Programme for Government on reforming the way health services are funded and delivered to achieve greater productivity and more cost effective services.</p></reply>

A national contract of indefinite duration for Home Helps employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) was agreed in 2006 with the relevant trade union as part of the work of the High Level Group established to review Home Help Services.  The contracts of home help workers employed by the HSE have been the subject of further deliberation, including Labour Court consideration in the interim years.</p><p>  On 29 June 2012 following a related hearing, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning home help contracts.  The HSE has engaged with SIPTU concerning the recommendation and its deliberations are on-going.  As part of this process it is currently undertaking an information gathering exercise to ascertain the up to date position regarding the nature of the contracts held by home helps and the hours worked under such contracts.</p></reply>

This will complement the measures already in place. However, I do not have any plans, in the context of GDL, for specific off-road lessons at this time. </p></reply>
