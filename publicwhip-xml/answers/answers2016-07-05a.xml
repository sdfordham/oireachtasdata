It is important for us now in the days, weeks, months and, indeed, years ahead, that Ireland&rsquo;s particular circumstances are understood and taken into account.</p>  <p>  In the period since the referendum result was announced, the Taoiseach, I and government colleagues have engaged in extensive contacts with political figures in Great Britain and Northern Ireland as well as with EU partners.</p>  <p>  On Friday 24 June, I spoke with the UK Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers.  I also spoke with political leaders in Northern Ireland and a number of my EU counterparts.  I travelled to Belfast on 29 June and met with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, with Secretary of State Villiers and with opposition leaders. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach participated at the European Council meeting on 28 June and subsequently at the informal meeting of 27 EU Heads of State and Government on 29 June.  As the Deputy is aware, the focus of these meetings was the outcome of the UK referendum and the Taoiseach spoke again with Prime Minister Cameron during the European Council.</p>  <p>   In terms of political leaders across the UK, the Deputy will be aware that Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s successor as leader of his political party will be made known by 9 September.  In the meantime, Prime Minister Cameron and his cabinet continue in office and we continue to work closely with them and with their officials. </p>  <p>  In the period prior to the referendum, including when Irish ministers and some members of the opposition travelled to the Britain and Northern Ireland to communicate the Irish perspective, there was extensive engagement with public representatives from both government and opposition.  Also, this week, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which brings together parliamentarians from across the UK and Ireland, met in County Dublin and focused much of their discussions on the outcome of the referendum.</p>  <p>  I enjoyed a positive working relationship with the former British Labour Party Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Vernon Coaker MP, and I look forward to working with his successor, David Anderson MP, in the time ahead.</p>  <p>  Having outlined my priorities during our special debate in this House last week, I would take this opportunity to reiterate two important points regarding the period ahead.  We must all bear in mind that the United Kingdom is not leaving the European Union immediately and that all arrangements, rights and facilities linked to EU membership still apply in full.  A negotiation process will get underway and will take a minimum of two years prior to a UK exit.  During that time the United Kingdom remains a full EU Member, with all the existing rights and obligations. </p>  <p>  Also, I would stress that the ongoing work to support stability, reconciliation and prosperity for the people in Northern Ireland is a key priority across this entire process.  The Irish government&rsquo;s strategy will be to work urgently and intensively with the British Government and Northern Ireland parties to see how collectively we can ensure that the gains of the last two decades are fully protected in whatever post-exit arrangements are negotiated.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-05a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500063#WRA01000"><p>I am very conscious of the deep concerns and anxiety that have arisen for many people across the community in Northern Ireland about the referendum outcome.  The fact that the majority within Northern Ireland who voted to remain now face their preference being set aside as a result of the overall result across the UK raises profound issues.</p>  <p>  As mentioned earlier in my response to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire&rsquo;s question, last Wednesday, 29 June, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I convened a Quarterly Review Meeting of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements where the referendum result was discussed.  The First and deputy First Minister represented the Executive, as did the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice.  In addition to the Review Meeting, I held a separate bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Villiers.</p>  <p>  Naturally the outcome of the UK referendum on the EU was a key element of both of these meetings.  In my meetings with Secretary of State Villiers, I emphasised the necessity and importance of both Governments and the Executive working together in the best interests of the people on this island. </p>  <p>  I also reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to work in support of stability, reconciliation and prosperity in Northern Ireland.  In this regard the Government will use its influence with our EU partners to seek to persuade them of the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island &ndash; a process to which the EU has already made a key contribution.  In addition I outlined that the Common Travel Area and cross-border EU funding, are key priorities for the Government in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  In my discussions with Secretary of State Villiers, we agreed that the Good Friday Agreement remains the basis for the two Governments&rsquo; approach to Northern Ireland.  The EU referendum result does not in any way diminish the centrality of the Good Friday Agreement or the requirement of both the British and Irish Governments to uphold it.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday and succeeding Agreements, the Irish Government is determined that its institutions, values and principles &ndash; including the right to the British or Irish or both - will be fully protected.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I noted that any future arrangements will not exclusively be determined by the wishes of the Irish Government, the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  They will also be influenced by the wider negotiations between the UK and the EU of 27 remaining Member States.  One of the challenges, therefore, will be for Ireland to use its influence with our EU partners to persuade them of the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island.</p></reply>

I also met with the leader of the opposition in the Knesset, Mr. Isaac Herzog, and with the Chair of the Knesset&rsquo;s Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, Mr. Avi Dichter. </p>  <p>  In Ramallah, I met with the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Rami Hamdallah, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Riad Malki. </p>  <p>  I also met with the Deputy Commissioner of the UN Relief and Works Agency, Ms. Sandra Mitchell, and visited the local office of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance.  Following my meeting with UNRWA, I announced a contribution of &euro;4 million for UNRWA&rsquo;s General Fund, to support the delivery of core services, and committed to maintaining the same level of funding for the next two years.  I also announced a contribution of a further &euro;500,000 for UNRWA&rsquo;s response in Gaza, thus fulfilling the pledge I made, on behalf of Ireland, at the Gaza reconstruction conference in 2014. </p>  <p>  My visit was planned before the scheduling of the French-hosted conference on the Middle East Peace Process, which took place in Paris on 3 June and in which I participated, but it afforded a timely opportunity to follow up on that meeting.  </p>  <p>  In all of my political meetings, I made clear my support for the French initiative, which aims to inject new momentum into the stalled peace process through international support and engagement.  I said this based on my own assessment of the situation and based also on the experience of the peace process on this island in which international support, from the US and elsewhere, proved invaluable at different times.</p>  <p>  The Palestinian side has publicly welcomed this renewed international engagement and I discussed in some detail with Minister Malki his priorities for follow-up to the Paris conference.  The Israeli Government have said clearly that they do not see value in this approach and repeated their wish to move to direct negotiations with the Palestinians, without wider international involvement.</p>  <p>  In my meetings I made clear the interest of the members of this House and of the Irish public in the Middle East Peace Process. </p>  <p>  In my meetings, I also discussed a range of more specific issues, including the expansion of settlements and the threat they pose to the peace process, the serious humanitarian situation in Gaza and the progress that has been made in reconstruction there as well as the limited improvements that have been made in access for goods, and the prospects for Palestinian reconciliation in the talks that have been taking place between Fatah and Hamas. </p>  <p>  My visit came shortly after the 8 June terrorist attack in Tel Aviv and the security situation in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories was discussed.  </p>  <p>  The Middle East Peace Process remains stalled. </p>  <p>  In explicit recognition of the view that the status quo is not sustainable, the French Government have been working to mobilise international engagement to help advance the prospects for peace.  This is not an easy task but it deserves and will receive our full support.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-05a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500063#WRA01700"><p>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>to continue to advance North South cooperation, my Department promotes and coordinates such cooperation, particularly through supporting the work of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).  In the aftermath of the UK Referendum vote to leave the European Union this is now of vital importance.</p><p>There was a Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council yesterday 4 July in Dublin Castle at which Government and Northern Ireland Executive Ministers together discussed the implications of the Referendum outcome for Northern Ireland and for relations between North and South on this island.  We also looked at what we can do together to minimise difficulties that may arise from the outcome.  This followed my meetings with Northern Ireland political leaders in Belfast last week.</p><p>At yesterday&rsquo;s Plenary meeting it was agreed that the Government and the Executive will work even more closely together to ensure that the gains of the peace process and North/South co-operation are fully protected in any new arrangements which may emerge as regards the United Kingdom&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union.  The Council also affirmed the important role that the NSMC plays in political and administrative relationships on this island and as a forum for ongoing North South discussion on important matters of mutual interest.  </p><p>The Council agreed that the NSMC sectoral meetings in the coming months which involve our Ministers and their opposite numbers in the Executive, will examine the implications of the UK referendum outcome and the need for possible mitigating actions in their areas of responsibility.  It was agreed that a further discussion on the implications of the referendum result will take place at the next NSMC Plenary meeting which is scheduled for November of this year.  </p><p>The North South Bodies, particularly Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland, are playing a continuing and central role in our economic recovery. </p><p>All of the North South Bodies are testament to the benefit of working together for mutual benefit, and in the light of the Referendum result it will be important that the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government continue to fully support the work of the Bodies.</p><p>In our contingency plan to deal with the possibility of the UK leaving the EU, one of the key actions is to monitor the short term impacts on enterprise and trade in border counties.  As details of the UK&rsquo;s exit framework emerge, we have recognised in our contingency planning the need to possibly revise and enhance the work and capability of InterTradeIreland, the North South Trade and Business Body, to ensure that companies trading across the border (in both directions) would be in position to deal with any added administrative burdens and procedures. </p><p>While future arrangements in regard to the border will not exclusively be determined by the combined wishes of the Irish Government, the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, as far as I am aware, no major party in Northern Ireland wants to see the re-imposition of a hard border on the island.  They, as do we, all wish to see a continuation of freedom of movement of trade, services and people on the island.</p><p>The current PEACE and  INTERREG Programmes which have now opened for funding calls are worth almost half a billion euro up to 2020, to be administered through the Special EU Programmes Body.  At yesterday&rsquo;s North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting the Council reiterated our joint commitment to the successful implementation of these programmes, and agreed that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Northern Ireland Finance Minister will further consider the issue of securing the ERDF funding for PEACE and INTERREG, including through engagement with the European Commission.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-05a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500063#WRA01900"><p>Ireland opposes the death penalty in all circumstances, and strongly condemns its use in all instances, including for those accused of apostasy or conversion to another religion.  Ireland promotes fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion, and strives to promote this principled position in all of its bilateral relations, including with Saudi Arabia.</p>  <p>  The abolition of the death penalty is one of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities at the United Nations, and one that we pursued while a member of the UN Human Rights Council.   More recently, Ireland stated its concern at Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s use of the death penalty on minors in its Item 4 Statement (Human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) at the Human Rights Council on 22 June.</p>  <p>  My Department regularly conveys Ireland&rsquo;s stance on the death penalty to all countries where the death penalty is still in use.  This includes Saudi Arabia, where our principled opposition to this practice is conveyed at every suitable opportunity, both to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia here in Dublin, and through our Embassy in Riyadh.    </p>  <p>  This and other human rights issues, including freedom of religion, are also raised with the Saudi authorities in conjunction with our EU partners.  In this way, the impact of our representations is maximised, having the backing of all Member States behind it.  Freedom of religion was raised by the EU in the context of the 2013 UN Human Rights Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia.  In January of this year, High Representative Mogherini reiterated the EU&rsquo;s strong opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, in the context of executions that had taken place in Saudi Arabia.</p>  <p>  Ireland does have close economic ties with Saudi Arabia.  The Kingdom is a designated priority market for Ireland under the Government&rsquo;s Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy.  We have a strong, and growing, trade relationship with Saudi Arabia, as we do with some of its neighbours.  Saudi Arabia represents a significant market for Ireland: total bilateral trade in 2014 was worth over &euro;1.4 billion, with &euro;1.3 billion of this in Ireland&rsquo;s favour.  The economic relationship therefore has considerable benefits for the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  The economic partnership that we have with Saudi Arabia, however, does not prevent us from raising human rights issues in the appropriate channels.  We will continue to maintain relations with Saudi Arabia: economic, for the benefit of our economy and trade; and diplomatic, to facilitate our continued engagement with the Kingdom on human rights and also on other matters as they arise.</p></reply>

The bulletin provides annual estimates of the percentage and number of people, children, working age adults and pensioners living in low income households in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the bulletin included the worrying statistic that 25% of children in Northern Ireland in the period examined were found to be living in poverty.  This issue is a devolved matter for which the Northern Ireland Minister for Communities Paul Givan, MLA, has lead responsibility.

Ground water drawn from the shared aquifer is allocated disproportionately in favour of Israel itself and Israeli settlers in Palestinian areas, and Palestinian water infrastructure is routinely demolished to preserve this control.  As a result, many Palestinian communities have to be supplied with water by tanker.</p>  <p>  Mekorot, the Israeli public water utility, has reportedly reduced supplies to a number of Palestinian communities in recent weeks, resulting in the shortages described by the Deputy.  Mekorot say the shortage is due to increased demand in the summer, and affects both Israeli and Palestinian consumers.  Some Palestinian reports state the opposite, that their supplies are being cut to preserve supplies to Israelis.  There are other claims as well, including that the shortage is intended to pressure Palestinians into agreeing to cooperate with water infrastructure plans which include illegal Israeli settlements.  It is difficult to be certain here at this remove what is the truth of the situation.</p>  <p>  Water is a final status issue, to be determined in a final overall agreement between the two parties.  What is clear is that, in the long years while that agreement has remained elusive, Israel has imported several hundred thousand settlers in to Palestinian areas, and discriminates in their favour in the distribution of water, to the detriment of Palestinians.  This underlines the continuing injustice inherent in the occupation of one people by another, and why it is imperative that the occupation be brought to an end.</p>  <p>  Ireland has raised these issues as part of our focus on the range of issues surrounding settlements, both bilaterally with Israel and through discussions at EU level.</p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners have also been directly active in supporting works to improve water supplies for Palestinians, as I set out in more detail in my reply to a recent Question (Written Question 194 on 22 June).</p></reply>

This is an important step in bringing to an end a 52-year conflict in which more than 220,000 people have been killed and 6.4 million people displaced.</p>  <p>  I congratulated all of the parties to the talks for their courage in pursuing peace, in particular President Juan Manuel Santos.  I would also like to pay tribute to former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Eamon Gilmore, for his ongoing work in his role as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian Peace Process.</p>  <p>  Our own history of conflict on this island gives Ireland a particular interest in conflict resolution, as is reflected in Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy priorities.  Consequently the Government is actively considering how we might support the finalization and implementation of the peace agreement in Colombia drawing on lessons learned from the Northern Ireland peace process.  To this end I sent a team of senior officials from my Department to Colombia earlier this year to assess the potential parameters of Irish support and I intend to bring the matter to Government for consideration in due course.    </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of the Government&rsquo;s support for Colombia in the implementation of this important peace agreement, recognising that full and faithful implementation by all parties is critical to the success of any peace agreement.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a longtime supporter of civil society groups and international agencies working to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights in Colombia.  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and our Embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia, regularly meet human rights groups both in Colombia and elsewhere.  The group of senior Irish officials which visited Colombia met a number of United Nations and civil society representatives, including from groups involved in the promotion and defence of human rights.  Subsequently, officials from the Department met Colombian Human Rights Defenders visiting Ireland with Peace Brigades International.  These discussions focused on the legacy of the conflict and the implications of the ongoing peace process. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has provided more than &euro;400,000 in funding for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia since 2014 and is also a long-time supporter of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Christian Aid and other organisations working in the area of human rights in Colombia. </p>  <p>  Ireland also engages with Colombia on human rights through EU structures, including the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue.  Ireland is an active contributor in this process which addresses the subject directly with the Colombian authorities at official level.  Through this mechanism, the Union engages in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including human rights defenders, trades unionists, prisoners, land restitution and environmental issues.  </p>  <p>  The promotion and defence of human rights is and will continue to be a central element of our engagement with Colombia - including during the implementation of the peace agreement.</p></reply>

This commitment is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government that was agreed in May.</p>  <p>  The all-Party D&aacute;il motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombing that was adopted in this House on 25 May has been conveyed to the British Government.  This motion, like the two previously adopted in 2008 and 2011, calls on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombing atrocities.  To this end I wrote to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in late May, conveying a copy of the recent resolution.  In addition, I raised the matter in my bilateral meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Belfast last week.  In this meeting I advised the Secretary of State that this latest motion represents the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  I underlined that the absence of a response from the British Government was of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House and emphasised the urgent need to respond to the three D&aacute;il motions.  Secretary of State Villiers recognised the importance that the government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case and she indicated that the British Government is considering whether it would be possible to provide a response that would adequately address the motions. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to raise this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  I have made clear to the Secretary of State that there is a pressing need to provide answers to the families of the victims.  The Taoiseach has also raised this issue with Prime Minister Cameron emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.</p>  <p>  Many families continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage with the British Government, the Executive and the Northern Ireland political parties in discussions to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  The Government believes that the legacy institutions agreed under the Stormont House Agreement offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families impacted by the Troubles.  I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on 23 May adopted Conclusions expressing deep concern at developments and calling on the Government and all other stakeholders, particularly the Independent National Electoral Commission, to create urgently the conditions necessary to hold free, transparent, inclusive and peaceful elections and to resume the electoral process as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Conclusions also underlined our concern about the obstacles to political debate in the country and reiterated that, in the run-up to the elections, ensuring respect for human rights, particularly civil liberties, and safeguarding an open political space are crucial prerequisites for real and credible dialogue.  The security situation in the east of the DRC remains precarious, causing population displacements and significant humanitarian needs, and the Conclusions strongly condemned the continued attacks by armed groups and the extreme violence being inflicted on the population of the DRC.  The EU and Member States have provided substantial support to the DRC, investing some &euro;10 billion over the last ten years in peacekeeping, and humanitarian and development assistance.</p>  <p>  At present four Irish Defence Forces personnel are serving with the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO), which is making a critical contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland raised the situation in the DRC during a UN Security Council Open Debate on Prevention and Resolution of Conflicts in the Great Lakes Region in March 2016, stressing the importance of respect for the rule of law, human rights and Constitutional provisions in the coming period.  The issue of electoral tensions was also raised by the Irish side at a meeting earlier this year between officials of my Department and representatives from the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Congo in London, stressing the importance of timely elections and peaceful cooperation between all parties.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided very significant levels of for the DRC.  Between 2010 and 2015, we provided &euro;44.61 million in funding to the DRC.  Of this, &euro;30.02 million was in humanitarian assistance, including &euro;24.3 million allocated to the UN Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC, and the remainder through NGO partners.  &euro;14.59 million was allocated to a range of civil society partners for their work on human rights, democracy, peace building and rule of law in DRC.  To date in 2016, we have provided over &euro;4.8million in humanitarian funding to the DRC.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this funding, Irish Aid has deployed two rapid responders to DRC this year.  These experienced specialists helped provide much needed surge capacity to UNICEF&rsquo;s response operations on the ground, focusing on child protection and cash programming.</p></reply>

We have restated this clearly in the Programme for Government.  &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, our policy for international development, articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) as Official Development Assistance (ODA).</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out our ambition to making progress towards the UN Target as resources permit.  It is important that such progress is made in a sustainable and manageable way which strengthens Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to the fight to end global poverty and hunger.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, Ireland has provided in excess of &euro;3.8 billion in ODA.  This has involved very significant annual contributions in excess of &euro;600 million, at a time of great economic difficulty.  Over this time, the Taoiseach and Ministers have consistently stated that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target once economic conditions allow.  </p>  <p>  Now, as our economic recovery consolidates and strengthens, we are in position to begin to make good on that commitment.  For 2016, we have provided a total of over &euro;640 million in ODA, an increase of &euro;40 million, or almost 7% on the 2015 budget allocation.  This represents the first substantial increase in the aid budget in over seven years.  Our aim is to continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with the commitment we have made with our fellow EU member states to collectively reach the UN 0.7% target by 2030. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Estimates process will commence shortly.  While final decisions on next year&rsquo;s budget allocation are ultimately a matter for Government, I will be making the strongest possible case for a sustainable increase in the 2017 budget allocation for Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance programme.</p></reply>

The Communication states that the ultimate aim of the Framework is the coordinated and coherent management of migration in full respect for humanitarian and human rights obligations.  It builds on the High Level Dialogues which the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy has been conducting in recent months aimed at engaging even more closely with countries of origin and transit and indeed with countries hosting large numbers of migrants. &euro;8 billion has been earmarked for the initiative up to 2020.</p><p>I welcome this focus in the Commission&rsquo;s initiative.

We should also remember the importance of ensuring that focusing on those countries and regions which are contributing to the migration flows does not lead to the exclusion of other developing partners, which are currently not contributing to these flows.  The EU needs to continue to build a comprehensive response to the immediate crisis, while looking to build the resilience of countries and communities &ndash; especially in Africa &ndash; where future crises can be averted.</p></reply>

This Unit works very closely with colleagues in the wider IUKA Division, especially those colleagues focused on Northern Ireland, with colleagues elsewhere in the Department, and in the Department of the Taoiseach.

Of course, conditions with regard to public discourse and debate on the Union within each Member State are different.  I am well aware that, in individual Member States, there are those who would wish to leave the Union.  However, this is not the position of any Government or Parliament.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the UK referendum has highlighted issues which are surfacing - not only in the EU &ndash; but in politics throughout the Western World.  From an EU perspective it reminds us of the need to focus on implementing concrete measures on jobs, growth and security &ndash; measures that improve the lives of all EU citizens, and that are the building blocks of long-term prosperity and stability for us all.  At the European Council meeting in Brussels last week which the Taoiseach attended, the 27 EU leaders addressed this point and had a preliminary exchange on the best way forward.  It was agreed that a period of further reflection would begin, and that they would have a more substantial discussion in the autumn.  To this end, a meeting of EU leaders has been scheduled for September in Bratislava, hosted by the Slovak Presidency.</p>  <p>  For the future, we must address the big challenges we face in a way that commands public confidence.  We must work both to ensure that the EU emerges stronger from the current situation: that it does its own work better and that it is better communicated to the public.

These brutal attacks continue to represent a serious threat to international peace and security.</p><p>The issue of how best to respond to the threat posed by terrorism has been high on the EU agenda over the past 18 months.  Foreign Ministers have focused on the contribution that the EU can make through external action to preventing and countering terrorism.  At the heart of the EU&rsquo;s strategy is engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism in full compliance with international law and human rights.  The EU is also focused on the need to address contributory factors and underlying causes and has stressed in particular the importance of a political solution to the conflict in Syria.</p><p>Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council I have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  I have also emphasised the need to ensure a joined-up approach in relation to the discussions of Foreign Ministers and those of our Justice and Home Affairs counterparts.</p><p>Increasing the effectiveness of information and intelligence-sharing and enhancing border security have been priority themes at recent meetings of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council and they will remain at the top of the agenda for the foreseeable future.  A series of measures is being rolled out to strengthen cooperation and to develop the EU's legal framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms.  Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>The EU&rsquo;s strategy and discussions are guided by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions including UNSCR 2161 on freezing funds and other assets of terrorist groups, and UNSCR 2178 on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State to plan or carry out terrorist acts or training.  I welcome also the presentation earlier this year by the UN Secretary General of a comprehensive Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.</p><p>A coordinated and comprehensive response to terrorism is key to ensuring the safety of peaceful citizens abroad and in Ireland.  Issues concerning national security and the protection of citizens in Ireland are a matter for my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  Threat levels are kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and appropriate measures taken.  It is the assessment of our security services that while a terrorist attack in Ireland remains possible, it is not likely.</p></reply>

We recommended that Israel end urgently night arrests of Palestinian children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation. </p>  <p>  Bilaterally, our concerns regarding the detention of Palestinian minors have been raised as part of our ongoing dialogue with the Israeli authorities on the overall situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel&rsquo;s treatment of the Palestinian population, both with the Israeli Embassy here and through our own Embassy in Tel Aviv.</p>  <p>  My clear view is that Palestinian children should be afforded the same rights and protections under the law which Israel rightly considers to be appropriate for Israeli children living alongside them.</p>  <p>  The overall human rights situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the treatment of children in detention, remains a matter of concern and will continue to be raised in the relevant multilateral fora, and to feature in the EU&rsquo;s broader concerns about human rights in the area. </p>  <p>  Similar concerns would exist in relation to the detention of children in many other states in the region.</p></reply>

This statement highlighted the importance of international participation in the accountability mechanism being developed and urged the Government to engage in broad and open consultations with all affected communities.</p>  <p>  Ireland understands reconciliation as a long-term process in which all levels of society should be actively involved.  In order to support this process in conflict-affected areas, my Department provides support to non-governmental organisations and international agencies involved in mediation and reconciliation throughout the world, several of whom are active in Sri Lanka.  These organisations engage at the levels of government, civil society and community to promote dialogue and reconciliation for a lasting and sustainable peace.</p></reply>

This includes issues relating to the border and EU funding.  During such negotiations we would actively seek to avoid the introduction of any new measures that could negatively impact on the Border region, either North or South. </p>  <p>  It is important to underline that we do not envisage any immediate changes to EU funded Cooperation Programmes involving Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  These include the current round of PEACE and INTERREG Programmes under the European Regional Development Fund which are managed on a North-South basis by the Special EU Programmes Body, which reports to the North-South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  On the specific issue of the operation of the European Court of Human Rights, the UK remains a party to the European Convention of Human Rights under which the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe are established.  This Convention system is separate and distinct to the European Union, and the referendum result has no impact on the UK&rsquo;s participation in that system.</p>  <p>  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.</p>  <p>  The Government has underlined this obligation in the context of British Government proposals to repeal the UK Human Rights Act, which incorporates the ECHR into domestic law and will continue to monitor the situation closely. </p>  <p>  As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles including in the area of human rights.  We will continue to work closely with the UK Government and with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

For example, in June 2015 the Secretary General attended the European Council discussion on security and defence to explain how NATO is responding to new security challenges.</p><p>EU-NATO cooperation takes place within the framework of the Lisbon Treaty.  The legally-binding Irish Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty expressly states that &ldquo;<i>The Treaty of Lisbon does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality</i>&rdquo;.  EU-NATO cooperation has no implications for this longstanding policy which has been pursued by successive Governments and which was reconfirmed last year in the Foreign Policy review &ldquo;The Global Island&rdquo; and in the White Paper on Defence.</p><p>At the European Council meeting last week, Secretary General Stoltenberg acknowledged that not all EU countries are members of NATO, and that the needs of individual countries in this regard must be respected.  He stressed that EU-NATO cooperation has to be inclusive and transparent, and must not infringe on the security and defence policies of individual nations.</p><p>The European Council agreed that, in light of new security challenges, there should be further practical cooperation between the EU and NATO in certain areas, including in relation to hybrid threats &ndash; threats which cross the boundary between military, policing, counter-terrorism, cybersecurity and other dimensions.  However, the Conclusions contain very clear confirmation that future EU-NATO cooperation will fully respect the decision making autonomy of both organisations and will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of any Member States.  We were to the fore in insisting that these long-standing guarantees, already enshrined in the Treaty, be clearly reiterated.  This is a strong acknowledgement that Ireland&rsquo;s policy of neutrality and non-NATO membership will in no way be affected by enhanced cooperation.</p><p>EU-NATO Cooperation has no implications for the &lsquo;Triple Lock&rsquo; which governs deployment of Irish military personnel outside the State.  As set out in legislation, this requires that: (1) the operation in question must be mandated by the UN; (2) that participation must be approved by the Government; and (3) that, with certain limited exceptions, it must be approved by way of a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p></reply>

The National Disability Authority (NDA) reports each year on progress made towards the target.  The most recent report published in 2015 shows that at the end of 2014, 3.5% of staff employed in public sector bodies are people with disabilities.  This is an increase from 3.4% in 2013 and is the fourth successive year of exceeding the 3% target.</p><p>These provisions are being strengthened in the context of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.  The Strategy was launched on 2 October 2015, and sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to, work are supported and enabled to do so.  It is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p>  The Strategy's six strategic priorities are to:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence;</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work;</p><p>- Make work pay;</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work;</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support;</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>  The Strategy contains commitments in relation to:</p><p>- An increase in the public service employment target of people with disabilities on a phased basis from 3% to 6%.</p><p>- Special public service competitions for people with disabilities and the opening up of alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities.</p><p>- The provision of an NDA-assisted employer helpline to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities.</p><p>The implementation of the Strategy will be subject to regular monitoring, and there will be a review and renewal every three years.

Maintenance of a valuation list is done using two processes known as <i>revaluation</i>and <i>revision</i>.</p><p>Revaluation is a process where all properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date.  Part 5 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for the revaluation of all commercial properties other than those occupied by public utility undertakings which are dealt with separately by way of a global valuation process prescribed in section 53 of the Acts.  After the first revaluation of a Local Authority area is completed, revaluation is then scheduled to take place every five to ten years to reflect changes in economic circumstances since the last revaluation took place.  Revision on the other hand is there to reflect structural changes or the addition of new properties between revaluations.</p><p>The national revaluation programme is the first general valuation of all commercial property in the state since the middle of the 19th century.  It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 146,000 properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting every Local Authority onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations, provided for in the legislation, will represent a sea-change for the rateable valuation system.  The present position is that all local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick are now revalued.  These 48,000 properties represent approx. 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms.  In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been valued on a global basis.</p><p>Significant progress is being made and the programme has established a momentum which will be shortly built upon as the Commissioner has made valuation orders for the revaluation of seven more Local Authority areas which are the County Council areas of Kildare; Leitrim; Longford; Offaly; Roscommon; Sligo and Westmeath.  The work of revaluation is currently under way simultaneously in all seven counties and first results are expected during the first quarter of 2017.  At this stage it would be premature for the Commissioner to say which counties will be included in the following tranche of counties to undergo a revaluation as there are a number of factors which will impact on that decision.  For instance, a vital determinant will be the outcome of the necessary consultations with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and with local authorities which is a pre-requisite prior to commencing a revaluation and which is provided for in section 19(1) of the Valuation Act 2001.  While the revaluation programme has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to maintain the valuation lists by carrying out revision work and since 2011 a total of 20,927 revision applications were dealt with while simultaneously carrying out the revaluations of Dublin City, Waterford and Limerick.</p><p>However, the revaluation programme needs to be accelerated and this is the main objective of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 8 June 2015.  The measures in the Act which will enable the Commissioner to accelerate the national programme of revaluation include provisions for Outsourcing, Occupier Assisted Valuation, streamlining the appeal process and wider use of computer-aided techniques.  Occupier Assisted Valuation is the term being used for a form of self-assessment that will be introduced and will be a valuable new addition which will help to accelerate the revaluation programme and will bring the ratepayer into closer contact with a system that is one of the key determinants of his or her rates liability.  Self-Assessment, in an appropriate form, has therefore been introduced by the new legislation.  Now that the legislation is in place, the Commissioner has commenced arrangements to pilot Occupier Assisted Valuation in one Local Authority area &ndash; County Laois - initially and is also using the enabling provisions in the new legislation to use outsourcing in two other Local Authority areas.  Utilising these new measures to supplement the proven capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver revaluations will see significant progress towards a more rapid completion of the national programme of revaluation.  As mentioned, the occupier-assisted valuation system will be tested in County Laois and its results together with the results of the outsourcing project will be critically appraised before a decision is taken by the Commissioner as to whether it is prudent to use these measures in revaluation projects commencing in other rating authority areas.</p></reply>

These functions have been introduced on a phased basis.  The Authority's initial priority has been the compilation of the statutory Register of Charities, with a view to underpinning and supporting the investigatory and enforcement functions.  The deadline for organisations to apply for inclusion on the Register of Charities was 16 April 2016 and a significant surge in applications was received before that deadline.  The Regulator is currently processing over 1500 applications from charitable organisations in addition to applications from 3,600 schools who are being registered in a separate registration system.</p>  <p>  My Department have been working closely with the Charities Regulator to ensure that the full range of provisions contained in the Charities Act 2009 can be commenced as soon as possible, in particular Part 4 of the Act which contains investigatory and enforcement powers.  I should point out that, in the interim, the Regulator has in place a process to receive and assess concerns received from the public (in relation to individual charities) and takes appropriate regulatory action when this is warranted.  However, having received advice in relation to this from the Authority, I can confirm that this afternoon I have signed the necessary Statutory Instrument to commence Part 4, to come into effect from 5 September 2016.</p>  <p>  Some sections of Part 7 also remain to be commenced.  These sections concern a range of miscellaneous matters, including provisions in relation to charitable fundraising.  Commencement of those provisions is dependent on the outcome of the deliberations of a Consultative Forum on Charitable Fundraising convened by the Regulator to make recommendations on the implementation of these provisions.  My Department is engaging with the Charities Regulator on an appropriate timeline for commencement of the remaining provisions of Part 7, and I expect to be in a position to sign these into effect in the near future.</p></reply>

The independence of the Charities Regulator must of course be respected and I have no direct role in the matter.</p>  <p>  However, I have been informed that the Regulator is aware of the allegations regarding a particular charity and that it is actively engaged with the trustees and representatives of the charity and, where appropriate, has referred material to other relevant authorities.  On 30 June last, the Charities Regulator used its statutory powers to address matters at the organisation referred to by appointing five new trustees, with the competencies and skills to support the charity to achieve its purpose, to the charity's Board.  This complements the legal moves made by the charity itself.  The Regulator also met last week with the charity, its legal representatives and the interim investigators and was informed that immediate action was being taken to protect the organisation&rsquo;s assets and ensure its continuation of services.  The Regulator authorised and supported legal action in the High Court to protect the charity's assets.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the Charities Regulator has no role in investigating criminal allegations such as fraud.

Our thoughts are always first and foremost with the survivors and the relatives of the victims of those events.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the late Mr. Justice Henry Barron carried out detailed inquiries into many of these awful incidents in which so many innocent people lost their lives, including the incident which the Deputy raises.  My Department and the Garda Authorities co-operated fully with the Barron inquiries, including in respect of providing the relevant documentation in their possession to Judge Barron.  Any documents held by my Department in respect of incidents such as these are reviewed on a regular basis with a view to release in accordance with requirements of the National Archives Act 1986, with particular regard to the requirements of section 8 of that Act in respect of the transfer of records to the National Archives.</p>  <p>  The attack was claimed at the time by the Ulster Volunteer Force.  It is very clear, however, from various investigations carried out down the years that members of the Ulster Defence Regiment were deeply involved in it.  Indeed, three former members of the UDR were prosecuted in Northern Ireland and convicted of murder for their part in this incident.  The 2011 report of the PSNI's Historical Enquiries Team concluded that the murders raised troubling questions about collusion between security forces in Northern Ireland and loyalist paramilitaries.  I understand also that a civil action for damages is being pursued currently in Northern Ireland against the police and the UK Ministry of Defence in respect of this incident.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, acknowledging and addressing the needs of the victims of violence has been an essential element of building peace and reconciliation in the context of the Northern Ireland peace process.  The Stormont House Agreement, established between the Irish and British Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland contains a series of valuable measures that aim to put in place a new framework to deal with the legacy of the troubles, including a mechanism to make available, if possible, more information about troubles-related killings to victims and their families from official and other sources.  The Government is fully committed to supporting those arrangements once agreement can be finalised in respect of them between all parties involved and detailed work is ongoing in this regard.</p></reply>

The programme is the outcome of a comprehensive review of foundation training for entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na completed in 2009 and which encompassed reviews of training in a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK, other European states and the United States.</p>  <p>  Phase 1, which lasts 32 weeks, is based in the Garda College and places a strong emphasis on problem-based learning where students learn in small groups through engagement with realistic policing scenarios.  This methodology emphasises the development of &lsquo;learning to learn&rsquo; skills, the development of reflective practice and supports the transition into learning in an operational policing environment.</p>  <p>  Phase 2, which lasts for 65 weeks, is primarily based in Garda stations with appropriate training and development structures in place that include access to a trained tutor Garda and a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.  During the course of their placements trainees move through three development stages from assisting his or her Garda tutor to taking the lead role and being assisted by the tutor, to finally the autonomous stage where they are deployed in regular policing activity and work independently within the operational unit.  Over the course of the placement they also return to the Garda College for a number to weeks to further enhance their skills in specialist areas including sexual assault, intelligence-led policing, file preparation and court presentation and so on.</p>  <p>  Phase 3 consists of seven weeks of preparation for final exams and assessments and I look forward to the first batch of new recruits graduating from the programme later this year.  In these I share the Garda Commissioner's view that it is too early to conduct a formal evaluation of the Programme.  I understand, however, from those leading the Programme that the feedback from managers and colleagues on the ground is positive.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that training and qualification in specialist functions takes place on a needs basis in collaboration with a range of policing and academic institutions in addition to internal expertise.  Additional courses are available in collaboration with a number of third level colleges for all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This takes the form of Garda members of all ranks participating in the various courses with other students from a variety of backgrounds.  The external third level training is provided in conjunction with a large volume of other training courses delivered through the Garda College around various specialist areas of policing.  In addition An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also offers places on Garda-run courses to relevant external bodies and agencies.</p></reply>

This combines regular reporting obligations with the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the issues concerned by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  That review will be open to all stake-holders including, on the delivery side, universities and other third-level providers of legal professional education.</p>  <p>  As a starting point, section 13 of the 2015 Act provides that the new Regulatory Authority may, and where required by the Act, shall, keep under review and make recommendations in respect of the admission requirements of the legal professions under their respective bodies and the availability and quality of such education and training.  This will also take into account the curriculum arrangements for the provision of clinical legal education and the teaching of legal ethics, negotiation skills, alternative dispute resolution and advocacy and the methods by which, and the persons by whom, such education and training is provided.</p>  <p>  The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority will also be obliged to report on the admissions policies of the legal professions within four months of the end of each financial year.  Under section 33 of the 2015 Act this report shall specify the number of persons admitted to each of the legal professions during the given year.  It  will also contain an assessment as to whether or not, having regard for the demand for the services of practising solicitors and barristers and the need to ensure an adequate standard of education and training for persons admitted to practice, the number of persons so admitted in that year "is consistent with the public interest in ensuring the availability of such services at a reasonable cost".  A copy of this report will be laid, by the Minister, before each House of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  In addition to these underlying functions, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been given the specific task of preparing, with the support of a public consultation process, what amounts to a comprehensive report to the Minister in relation to "the education and training (including on-going training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners, including the manner in which such education and training is provided".  This report is to be provided to the Minister within two years of the new Authority's establishment and under the detailed parameters set out in section 34 (3) of the 2015 Act.  It will contain "a review of the existing arrangements relating to the education and training of legal practitioners" and make such recommendations as considered appropriate in relation to the arrangements that, in the opinion of the Authority, should be in place for the provision of such education and training.  This is to include "the accreditation of bodies to provide such education and training and the reforms or amendments, whether administrative or legislative, that are required to facilitate those arrangements".</p>  <p>  I would also draw attention to Section 34 (3) (c) of the Act which lays out the specific areas of recommendation that are to be dealt with under the review process.  These are to include, among other matters, the appropriate standards of education and training for legal professional qualifications; arrangements necessary to monitor those standards; the scope and content of the curriculum for the courses concerned; standards required for the award of legal professional qualifications, and arrangements that would facilitate the minimisation of duplication and consequent expense incurred in the taking of overlapping examinations in legal subjects.</p>  <p>  Under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority is, therefore, set to regularly monitor, and to undertake a comprehensive review, of legal professional education that will include stake-holder participation in the relevant public consultation process.  These reforming measures provide us, under the terms and objectives of the 2015 Act, with a ready-made opportunity to shape and reform the provision of legal professional education in the State for the years to come.</p></reply>

I understand that while statistics in relation to fraud offences are produced the breakdown in relation to insurance fraud requested by the Deputy is not recorded in the official crime figures.  However, to be of assistance I have asked the CSO to forward the available statistics in relation to the matters referred to directly to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the question of penalties are concerned, depending on the individual circumstances of the case, the following offences in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 may be relevant:</p>  <p>  Section 6 (Making gain or causing loss by deception) provides that a person who dishonestly, with the intention of making a gain for himself or herself or another, or of causing loss to another, by any deception induces another to do or refrain from doing an act is guilty of an offence.  A person is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p>  <p>  Section 25 (Forgery) provides that a person is guilty of forgery is he or she makes a false instrument with the intention that it shall be used to induce another person to accept it as genuine and, by reason of so accepting it, to do some act, or to make some omission, to the prejudice of that person or any other person.  A person is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.  There are also offences of &lsquo;Using false instrument&rsquo; (section 26), &lsquo;Copying false instrument (section 27), &lsquo;Using copy of false instrument (section 28), &lsquo;Custody or control of certain false instruments, etc (section 29).  The definition of 'instrument' is contained in section 24 and includes a certificate of insurance.</p>  <p>  In addition, the following penalties exist in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 in relation to personal injury claims:</p>  <p>  Section 25 of the Act makes it an offence to give or adduce or dishonestly cause to be given or adduced evidence that is false or misleading and which the person knows to be false or misleading.  It is also to be an offence to give, adduce etc. false instructions or information to a solicitor or expert.  The section applies to actions pending at its commencement as well as to subsequent actions.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Act provides that a person guilty of an offence under Part 2 of the Act shall be liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.  A person tried summarily shall on conviction be subject to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 (under section 5 of the Fines Act 2010, this fine would be classified as a Class B fine i.e. a fine not exceeding &euro;4,000) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.  </p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p><p>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question Number 115 of 14 June 2016, the area concerned is patrolled by members assigned to the Roscommon/Longford Division.  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division on the 31 May 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 298.  Of these, 42 members were assigned to Granard Garda District and 11 to Edgeworthstown Garda Station, 9 Garda&iacute; and 2 Sergeants.  The detailed allocation of resources at Divisional level is a matter for the Divisional officer who may allocate resources between Garda stations as required by operational circumstances.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the number of members assigned to the Division when the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was at its highest in September 2009 was 299, with 42 members assigned to Granard District and 6 in Edgeworthstown Station.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. In a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 300 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November. I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 5 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Roscommon/Longford Division to date. </p><p>The Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; commits to</font>continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p></reply>

A necessary first step in preparation for these commencements is the appointment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority after which the Authority will appoint its own Chief Executive.  I can confirm that nominations to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been received from the relevant nominating bodies as set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act.  The appointment by Government of the relevant nominees under the various criteria set out in the Act will then be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Government will appoint one of the lay members of the Authority, which will also have a lay majority, to be Chairperson.  Preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act.  A start-up support team is being established and a suitable premises is being identified from which the new Authority can commence its operations. </p>  <p>  These are the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spear-head the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime.  This stage will also include the phased commencement of Parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.  Under section 7 of the 2015 Act, I will also, by order, appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.</p>  <p>  Following establishment of the Authority and appointment of a Chief Executive the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The managed commencement of these functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.  It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions contained in the 2015 Act, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law.</p>  <p>  In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million was made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority.  Any funding advanced from this allocation will be provided on a recoupable basis.  Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions under the terms set out in Part 7 of the 2015 Act.</p></reply>

That Review Group was established in 2012 in line the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group to conduct a wide ranging strategic review of penal policy taking into account relevant work already carried out in this jurisdiction and elsewhere, the rights of those convicted of crimes, the perspective of those who are victims of crime, and the interests of society in general.</p><p>The terms of reference for the Group included an examination and analysis of the role of penal policy in crime prevention; sentencing policies; alternatives to custody; custodial accommodation and regimes; reintegration and rehabilitation; and any special issues relating to female offenders.</p><p>The Report contains 43 recommendations relating, inter alia, to an increased focus on effective data management and to my Department joining with all Government Departments and agencies to facilitate and support research in order to assist in the formulation of penal policy. </p><p>One of the recommendations of the Review Group specifically recognises that a whole of government approach in collaboration with relevant agencies and local authorities is necessary in addressing offending behaviour and assisting offenders in maintaining crime free lives.  My Department, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service fully support this approach.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>As outlined in the recently published Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan 2016-2018, the IPS will place a renewed emphasis on prisoner rehabilitation by further developing and re-engineering services designed to address the factors that contribute to offending.  My Department is currently in communication with the Department of Health in relation to a fundamental review of health care in prisons and the provision of health care services in prisons generally.</p><p>The IPS in collaboration with HSE Mental Health Services has detailed specific goals in relation to improving mental health service provision in all closed prisons, over the course of the next strategic cycle.  The IPS will continue to advance collaborative relationships with other key statutory and community services to improve arrangements to ensure the safe transition of individuals from custody to community. </p><p>Work is under way to progress the implementation of the recommendations of the Review Group.  To this end I have established a Penal Policy Implementation Oversight Group.  The Group is chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan, Associate Professor, School of Law, Trinity College who was a member of the review group.  The Group organised a Workshop on 8 February 2016 of the key actors in order to discuss the recommendations of the Penal Policy Review Group and advance their implementation.  I have recently received the second report from this group setting out the state of implementation and it is my intention to publish this report shortly.</p></reply>

It was open to counsel to make any recommendation that they saw fit.</p><p>It is important that the independence of the process is understood.  Counsel who carried out the review of each case were selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  Following their reviews of the papers in each case, counsel made recommendations to me as to whether or not further action should be carried out by me, and if so the nature of that action.  In many cases the outcome was that there was no further action which should or indeed which could be taken by me as Minister.</p><p>Appropriate steps were taken to ensure that nothing arose which might in any way have detracted from the integrity of the review mechanism, including issues of conflict of interest.  Arrangements were put in place to ensure that if there was any conflict, or potential conflict, the conflicted counsel not only was not involved in the particular complaint, but also was not aware of which counsel was reviewing it.  This is normal professional conduct and there were sufficient counsel on the Panel to ensure the practicality of this.  Whatever steps were necessary in this regard were taken to ensure there was no conflict of interest.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>To ensure that all complainants received an accurate account of the process, I also appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of individual letters notifying each person of the outcome of the review in their particular case.  I was concerned that these letters should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.  I made this appointment in order to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish. </p><p>I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.  However, counsel were free to make whatever recommendation they considered appropriate in each case, including the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry if they considered that it was warranted.</p><p>I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However, I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation.</p><p>A letter setting out the outcome of the review of the particular case referred to by the Deputy issued last December.  The recommendation made by counsel was that I should take no further action in this case.  I should mention, however, that my predecessor referred aspects of this particular case to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and I understand that investigation has not concluded. </p><p>  I should also mention that a civil action has been initiated against the State in respect of issues raised in the complaint.  In the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on any particulars of this matter.</p></reply>

The Charities Regulatory Authority (also known as the Charities Regulator) was established as an independent agency on 16 October 2014 and is responsible for the registration and regulation of all the charities active in this country.  The key areas of work of the Regulator include registration and award of charitable status, annual reporting, compliance and investigations, charity services and providing a public register and statistical information on the charity sector.  I am determined to make sure that the Authority has the necessary staff and financial resources available to achieve its goals.</p>  <p>  The Charities Regulator was allocated a significant increase in its pay budget for 2016 to allow for the full complement of staff required to ensure that the full range of provisions contained in the Charities Act 2009 could be commenced as soon as possible.  A budget of &euro;2.665 million has been allocated to the Regulator for 2016, compared to a budget of &euro;1.419 million for 2015, an increase of 88%.  This increased funding is facilitating recruitment of additional staff in key areas including policy development, registration and reporting, compliance and investigations and communications.  On establishment there were 10 staff working in this area which has been increased to 23 currently and the budget for 2016 provides for this to increase further to 36.  My Department, together with the Public Appointments Service, is working to put in place the full complement of staff and I expect these staff to be in place in the coming weeks and months.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, as of now the GRA remains outside the Agreement.  The members of the GRA have exercised their democratic mandate and I respect their right to do so, however, the decision not to become party to the Agreement has consequences for the members of the GRA. </p>  <p>  In particular, as of 1 July, members of the GRA are subject to an increment freeze under section 7(1) of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2013, as amended.  No-one wishes to impose an increment freeze on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or indeed on any other public servant, but it is the law.  We must also, of course, be fair to the vast bulk of public servants who have accepted the Agreement and are cooperating with its terms.  This group includes the Associations representing Superintendents and Chief Superintendents in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The other Garda representative body, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) decided last week to re-ballot their membership with a recommendation to accept the Agreement.  I very much welcome that decision by AGSI and their members will not be subject to any increment freeze while that ballot is in train. </p>  <p>  In the context of discussions with AGSI aimed at addressing their concerns, a pathway to restoring the rent allowance - worth &euro;4,155 annually to new recruits - before the end of this year was agreed in principle.  Those provisions will become operative if and when the GRA comes within the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  I know that the restoration of the rent allowance is something that the GRA has advocated for on behalf of new recruits and I know it to be a major issue for new recruits.  That allowance, the requirement to work additional hours under the Haddington Road Agreement, access to the industrial relations machinery of the State, and the opportunity for the GRA to negotiate the pay of its members on an equal footing with other Unions and Associations in the public service, are all on the table for discussion, as soon as the GRA is in a position to enter talks with my Department.</p>  <p>  I genuinely believe that it would be in the best interests of their members and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a whole for the GRA to engage with my Department.  It is only through talking that their concerns can be addressed.  I believe there is a pathway to progress on these issues and my Department and I remain available to work with the GRA. </p></reply>

I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are taking all necessary steps to thoroughly investigate these crimes and identify the perpetrators.  It is of course essential that anyone who may have information about such crimes, even if appears insignificant, should contact the Garda&iacute;.  The Deputy will appreciate that as Garda investigations into these matters are ongoing I cannot comment in more detail on the specific policing responses which are being pursued.</p>  <p>  In recent times An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have supported a number of partnership initiatives in relation to crimes affecting rural communities.  A particular example is the campaign launched in 2015 to combat the problem of livestock theft, jointly organised by Crimestoppers, the Irish Farmers Association and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This campaign is calling on members of the public and in particular those in the farming community with information on the theft of cattle and sheep to come forward with information.  A reward fund of &euro;10,000 is available for significant information.  Information can be given anonymously to the Crimestoppers confidential telephone service by calling 1800 25 00 25.  Alternatively, information can be provided to any Garda station.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaged in a range of targeted operations to disrupt the activities of organised mobile gangs who may be involved in the crimes referred to.  I am pleased to say that the latest CSO crime figures, published last week, show a very significant decline in property related crime.  The decrease in burglary for the twelve months ending 31 March 2016 is 18.4% compared to the previous twelve month period.  There are also welcome decreases of 7% for theft and 6.7% for robbery during the same period.  This underlines the success that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is having in combating property crime through the targeted strategy which is being implemented under Operation Thor.  Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity with more than 24,000 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 30,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 1,900 arrests and 2,200 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that the recently announced package of additional resources to support Garda operations in 2016 includes provision for the ongoing implementation of operation Thor.  So I can assure the Deputy that there will be no let-up on the pressure which the Garda&iacute; are bringing to bear on organised crime, including the mobile gangs who have targeted rural communities through livestock and other property crime.</p></reply>

In a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 300 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.

This decision will have an adverse impact on the growth outlook.  In this context, the more traditional exporting sectors are particularly exposed, especially to bilateral euro sterling exchange rate developments.  My Department's initial estimate, based on the assessment in the SES, is that GDP growth could be about 0.5% lower than projected in 2017.</p>  <p>  The fiscal space of just under &euro;1 billion for 2017 set out in the Summer Economic Statement is not expected to change very much because the factors used to calculate it are largely fixed at this stage.</p>  <p>  Looking to 2018 and beyond, the estimates of fiscal space depend on the impact on our macroeconomic and fiscal position.  At this point, it is far too early to speculate on the potential impacts.  </p>  <p>  As noted in the Summer Economic Statement, the Department of Finance will prepare a full macroeconomic projection in advance of Budget 2017 in October, and this will include updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account of developments up to that time, including the UK decision.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that there is uncertainty around many aspects of the impact of the UK decision, and particularly the economic and fiscal impact.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware, a whole-of-government contingency framework has been put in place in response to the UK vote, within which key policy issues, including economic developments, will continue to be tracked and the Budget 2017 forecasts will be a critical part of that process. </p>  <p>  Finally, the prudent economic and fiscal policies implemented over recent years have placed Ireland in a stronger position to weather this shock.  Our economy is growing strongly, employment has increased for 14 successive quarters, unemployment has fallen to 7.8%, the deficit this year is expected to be 0.9%, and the debt has fallen from a peak of 120% to an expected 88% at the end of this year.  The Government is confident that our economy is resilient and that appropriate economic and fiscal policies are in place to deal with the challenges arising.</p></reply>

However, the rate had slight losses on Friday 1 July.  The euro's exchange rate against the pound sterling continues to be largely driven by uncertainty related to the referendum.  The magnitude of changes in EUR to USD have been much more modest.</p>  <p>  Under the European Central Bank's (ECB's) Expanded Asset Purchase Programme, often referred to as "Quantitative Easing" (QE), the eurosystem (comprising the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area) has been purchasing &euro;80 billion of public and private assets per month and plans to do so until at least March 2017, or until inflation returns to levels consistent with price stability, defined as inflation below, but close to, 2 per cent.  Purchases of sovereign debt began on 9 March 2015. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that monetary policy is a matter for the European Central Bank which is independent.  The ECB has stated that it is closely monitoring financial markets and is in close contact with other central banks.  The ECB has stated that it stands ready to provide additional liquidity, if needed, in euro and foreign currencies.</p></reply>

It allows for the tax-free transfer by way of gift or inheritance of the residential property in which a beneficiary lives, subject to certain conditions.  These conditions include a requirement that the beneficiary has been living in the property for three years prior to receiving it and that they remain living in the property for six years afterwards, except in certain special circumstances.  It is also a condition of the relief that the beneficiary not be beneficially entitled to any other residential property at the time of the transfer. </p>  <p>  The underlying purpose of the relief, which I consider to be reasonable, is to prevent so far as possible cases of hardship arising from a tax perspective when a person is gifted or inherits what is, in effect, their home.  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners have encountered some evidence that individuals may be using the relief as a way of passing on wealth tax-free in a manner which is not in line with the core aim of the relief. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners are currently working to gather and assess information relating to such possible practices and to consider whether the current scope of the relief is in line with its original spirit.

These conditions apply to anybody receiving a gift or inheritance of agricultural property and there are no specific allowances available for individuals with a disability.</p>  <p>  Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief' which takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.  Arising from recommendations made as part of the Agri-Taxation Review in 2014, additional measures have since been introduced to ensure that tax-relieved agricultural land is used productively.</p>  <p>  The requirement for a person who receives a gift or inheritance of agricultural property (the beneficiary) to have one of the specified agricultural qualifications (i.e. those listed in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999) does not apply in all situations.  Where the beneficiary does not have such a qualification, he or she has the alternative option of qualifying for agricultural relief by actively farming the agricultural land.  A person is regarded as actively farming where he or she farms the land on a commercial basis for at least 50% of his or her normal working time for at least 6 years after receiving the gift or inheritance.  However, instead of personally farming the land, a beneficiary may lease the land to another person who, in turn, actively farms the land.</p></reply>

The Act modified the qualifying criteria to include properties where: </p>  <p>  1. a certificate of damage has been completed by a competent person as set down in I.S. 398-1.2013 or,</p>  <p>  2. the property has been accepted into the pyrite remediation scheme operated by the Pyrite Resolution Board or,</p>  <p>  3. an insurance company has remediated the property or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation or,</p>  <p>  4. the person who built the property has remediated it or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation.</p>  <p>  Property owners claiming the exemption under Criteria 1 must provide a certificate to Revenue, which is completed in accordance with I.S. 398-1.2013 as set down by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Property owners claiming the exemption under Criteria 2 to 4 must provide appropriate supporting documentation.  Once granted, the exemption becomes applicable from the following 1 November and normally remains in place for a period of seven years.  The Act does not provide entitlement to the exemption for any years previous to a property being accepted as having significant pyritic damage.  In regard to the specific cases mentioned by the Deputy, Revenue has advised me that the properties referred to in Questions 19281 and 19284 were certified as having significant pyritic damage in March 2015 and June 2015 respectively.  In accordance with the legislation, the certification entitled the property owners to the exemption from 1 November 2015 for a period of six years, i.e. 2016 to 2022.  It does not provide entitlement to the exemption for the years prior to certification, i.e. 2013 to 2015.  The property owners were informed that the exemption had been granted in May 2016.  The person referred to in Question 19275 has just recently provided the required supporting documentation.  Revenue will make direct contact with the person as soon as the documentation is evaluated.</p></reply>

The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 sets out timeframes within which a regulated entity must respond to complaints.  If the consumer is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Financial Services Ombudsman investigates, in an impartial and independent manner, complaints from individual customers and small businesses who have unresolved disputes with financial service providers which are regulated by the Central Bank.  </p><p>Finally, you may wish to know that a searchable register of all entities regulated by the Central Bank is available here: <i></i>.</p></reply>

Short term temporary staff are generally required due to the seasonal nature of some work in Revenue, including Ennis, and to cover staff availing of shorter working year during the period from June to end of August.</p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) run competitions on an annual basis for Temporary Clerical Officer (TCO) positions across the Civil Service.  Candidates who are successful are placed on an order of merit from which Revenue recruits temporary staff.</p>  <p>  Revenue is not in a position to offer permanent employment when the fixed term contract expires.  The recruitment and appointment of permanent staff in Revenue is regulated by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  All recruitment for permanent clerical positions in Revenue must be carried out in accordance with a licence granted by the Commission.  The licence held by Revenue does not provide for the awarding of permanent contracts to these staff on the basis of their temporary employment.  However, they are eligible to apply in the normal way for any open competitions being run by PAS or Revenue for the recruitment of permanent staff.  In January 2014 Revenue ran a competition which enabled serving temporary Revenue staff, including those in Ennis, to fill a number of permanent posts.  More recently, the Public Appointments Service held an open clerical officer competition which closed in June 2016.  Temporary Revenue staff were eligible to apply for this competition.  Revenue will recruit from this panel to fill permanent clerical officer positions as they arise.</p></reply>

A person who qualifies for the SPCCC is also entitled to an &euro;4,000 extension in the standard rate band, which increases the rate band from &euro;33,800 to &euro;37,800.  The estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer of increasing this specific band to &euro;45,000 is in the order of &euro;19.6 million and &euro;26.6 million respectively. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that a standard rate band system such as that outlined, allowing a &euro;36,000 rate band for single individuals and &euro;70,000 for a married couple or civil partners, would give rise to Constitutional issues.  There is a Constitutional requirement, deriving from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i>the Attorney General (1980), that a married couple must not have a greater tax liability than two single people living together and having the same income.  For this reason the current maximum married two-earner band of &euro;67,600 is double the value of the single band of &euro;33,800.</p><p>All figures provided in the Ready Reckoner are estimates for 2016 incomes from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2013, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

NAMA requires that the projected return resulting from the provision of additional funding must be the value maximising strategy for the asset and this is fully in accordance with Section 10 of the NAMA Act.  This means NAMA will facilitate the funding of development of only those sites that are commercially viable and where site development will deliver a better recovery than the sale of the undeveloped site.</p>  <p>  - The rates offered to NAMA debtors and receivers by NAMA are unrelated to NAMA's own cost of funding.  Where NAMA provides funding to facilitate development by its debtors or receivers, it is provided at appropriate market rates of interest.  </p>  <p>  - NAMA and my Department are cooperating fully in their support of the Commission's work.  As the primary relationship with the Commission is held by the State, the Department of Finance is fully involved with NAMA in a joint engagement with DG Comp. </p>  <p>  - NAMA has produced detailed evidence regarding the complaint which the Department of Finance has provided to DG Comp to assist in its investigation.  Department of Finance and NAMA officials also have met with DG Comp to discuss this evidence and DG Comp's questions in detail.  Senior Department officials maintain an open dialogue with DG Comp as they progress their work.</p>  <p>  - The clear intention of NAMA's residential funding initiative is to enhance returns over and above any other viable strategy, provide funding on terms comparable to those available elsewhere in the market and ensure there is no impact on competition more generally. </p>  <p>  I understand that Commission officials continue to review submissions and information received from all parties and have not yet reached a preliminary determination on the complaint.</p></reply>

Consequently a full service payment account service has been recently developed by the Registry of Credit Unions in conjunction with a group of credit unions to allow eligible credit unions to offer these accounts and associated payment instruments such as debit cards. This service is subject to formal application and approval as an additional service under sections 48 to 51 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  To date no credit union has been approved for a full service payment account, however the Central Bank is currently at an advanced stage with a number of applications. </p>  <p>  I have been further informed by the Central Bank that the provision of Automatic Teller Machine services to credit union members does not require regulatory approval and has been an exempt service since 2004 (SI 223 of 2004).

Regarding credit cards, there has been no engagement from individual credit unions, representative bodies or other stakeholders in respect of credit cards, nor has this area ever been highlighted as a business priority.  </p></reply>

This decision will have an adverse impact on the growth outlook.  In this context, the more traditional exporting sectors are particularly exposed, especially to bilateral euro sterling exchange rate developments.  My Department's initial estimate, based on the assessment in the SES, is that GDP growth could be about 0.5% lower than projected in 2017.</p>  <p>  The fiscal space of just under &euro;1 billion for 2017 set out in the Summer Economic Statement is not expected to change very much because the factors used to calculate it are largely fixed at this stage.</p>  <p>  Looking to 2018 and beyond, the estimates of fiscal space depend on the impact on our macroeconomic and fiscal position.  At this point, it is far too early to speculate on the potential impacts.</p>  <p>  As noted in the Summer Economic Statement, the Department of Finance will prepare a full macroeconomic projection in advance of Budget 2017 in October, and this will include updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account of developments up to that time, including the UK decision.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that there is uncertainty around many aspects of the impact of the UK decision, and particularly the economic and fiscal impact.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, a whole-of-government contingency framework has been put in place in response to the UK vote, within which key policy issues, including economic developments, will continue to be tracked and the Budget 2017 forecasts will be a critical part of that process. </p>  <p>  Finally, the prudent economic and fiscal policies implemented over recent years have placed Ireland in a stronger position to weather this shock.  Our economy is growing strongly, employment has increased for 14 successive quarters, unemployment has fallen to 7.8%, the deficit this year is expected to be 0.9%, and the debt has fallen from a peak of 120% to an expected 88% at the end of this year.  The Government is confident that our economy is resilient and that appropriate economic and fiscal policies are in place to deal with the challenges arising.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  In respect of teachers, the estimated cost of reversing the decision to withdraw qualification allowances from post-1 February 2012 entrant teachers is approximately &euro;16 million per annum.  In addition, the estimated cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrant teachers (who have been recruited up to June 2016) to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements is approximately &euro;44 million per annum.</p>  <p>  The cost figures set out above are inclusive of teachers on my Department's main payroll, substitute teachers, Employers' PRSI and include an estimated cost in respect of teachers in Education and Training Board schools.  They do not include the cost of removing the cap on qualification allowances because a precise calculation of this would depend on the qualifications held by those individual teachers.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the Public Service, including entry pay levels.  The terms of reference and timescale for the Commission's work are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and would require broad consultation, including engagement with staff representatives as was committed to in the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The teacher unions have made it clear to my Department that this is an issue of major concern to them.</p></reply>

The Government has set out its commitments to the Gaeltacht and to the Irish language in the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish language 2010 &ndash; 2030.  The Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017 -2022 is a key commitment by the Department of Education and Skills to the Twenty Year Strategy.</p>  <p>  In relation to school provision nationwide, my Department is focused on ensuring that all schools in an area can between them cater for all students seeking a school place.  In this regard, my Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses a range of data sources in carrying out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.  The outcome of the 2015 demographic exercises, based on the GIS, was the announcement in November 2015 of the establishment of four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools to open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs.</p>  <p>  After it is decided that a new school is required, a separate patronage process is conducted to establish who will run the school.  In April this year, my Department issued an invitation to school patron bodies and prospective patron bodies to apply for the patronage of the nine new post-primary schools to open in 2017 and 2018.  The criteria used in relation to patronage of new schools places particular emphasis on parental demand for plurality and diversity, with parental preferences at the centre of the process.  In this regard, as part of the application process, prospective patrons must submit completed parental preferences, including whether parents wish their child(ren) to be educated through the medium of Irish or of English.</p>  <p>  The closing date for receipt of applications to my Department was 8th June and my Department is currently in the process of assessing the applications received as part of the patronage process for the nine new schools.  Following completion of this analysis, my Department will prepare detailed assessment reports in relation to each of these new schools based on the applications received, for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG), which will then submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. </p></reply>

Good progress has been made on implementation of the Charter objectives, as set out below under a number of key headings.</p><p>A - The Arts in Education Portal (<i>www.artsineducation.ie</i>): Ireland's first Arts in Education Portal, the key national digital resource for arts in education in Ireland and a major resource for arts education in Irish schools, was launched in May 2015.  Since its launch up to the end of March 2016, there have been 18,145 visitors (per session) with 43,295 page views, an average of nearly 4,000 page views per month.  A celebration and demonstration of the success of the Portal formed part of the National Arts in Education Day, held at The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) on 23rd April 2016.</p><p>B - Teacher &ndash; Artist Partnership as a model for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) initiative: An important development is the more focused attention to helping artists and teachers to develop together their understanding, expertise and creative pitch for arts in education work for children at different age levels.  A significant initiative in this regard was the initiation in 2014 by the Charter Group of a pioneering programme of joint teacher - artist collaboration in continuing professional development.  The scheme, 'Exploring Teacher Artist Partnership as a Model of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Supporting and Enhancing Arts Education', commenced in 2014.  It is intended that the Education Centres, responsible for local delivery of national programmes of teacher professional development on behalf of my Department, will have the capacity to implement this model locally and regionally into the future.  This will be possible through strategic planning involving collaboration and co-operation with the various Local Authority Arts Offices, art organisations, educational institutions and school communities. </p><p>C - Artists in Residencies in Higher Education Institutions: Significant developments regarding arts in education for initial teacher education have also been taking place.  Higher education institutions, particularly colleges of education, have been extending their offerings of arts in education courses and experience for student teachers.  The provision of a set of 'artists in residency' bursaries by the Arts Council, for such institutions, has been a major boost to this work.</p><p>D - Artists-Schools Guidelines: The Artists-Schools Guidelines were originally published in 2006.  A number of changes have occurred in the arts in education landscape in Ireland since the Guidelines were first published.  A significant change arising from the Charter is the launch of a national digital resource for the arts in education at <i>www.artsineducation.ie</i>.  Given this changing landscape, the Arts Council, on behalf of the Implementation Group of the Arts in Education Charter, is currently reviewing the Artists-Schools Guidelines to examine whether and how they should be updated to continue to act as a useful resource.</p><p>E - ARIS &ndash; Arts Rich Schools: The Arts in Education Charter charges the Arts Council, in co-operation with the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht and my Department, with the promotion of Arts Rich Schools (ARIS).  According to the Charter &ndash; 'ARIS will incentivise and recognise those schools (primary and post-primary) which in a range of ways make the arts a key part of school life and place the arts centrally within the life of the school community affecting pupils primarily but also teachers, parents, other staff and community.  A working group is assisting with the development of Ar&iacute;s and the development of a feasible implementation plan for a first phase of Arts over three years (2017-2019).</p><p>F - Music Generation: The Music Generation initiative is co-ordinated and managed by Music Generation Ltd. through its National Development Office. Between 2010 and 2015, 11 Music Generation Music Education Partnerships (MEPs) were established as part of Phase 1 of the initiative, with the aim to provide non-mainstream vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people.  In 2015, Music Generation Ltd. announced Phase 2 of the initiative during which up to 9 additional new MEPs will be established over the period from 2016 up to 2020.  Initial funding for 50% of Phase 1 of the Music Generation initiative came from philanthropic sources with the remaining 50% funding from MEPs, with the Exchequer taking up 50% funding after 3 years. Phase 2 will similarly funded.</p><p>G - Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme: The Department of Education and Skills also established the new Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme in February 2016, worth &euro;50,000.  The Purpose of the scheme is to provide support by way of a cash grant to established, smaller-scale, non-mainstream music education/community music initiatives with limited or no access to other forms of public funding. </p><p>H - School Policies: The Charter envisages that schools, in their school policies and plans, shall incorporate arts in education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  Schools will be assisted by my Department in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation.  Making provision for arts in education practice will also be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also established reciprocal partnership with the Arts Council in the promotion of the arts in schools, as set out in the Charter.</p><p>Implementation of the Arts in Education Charter is overseen by an Implementation Group, chaired by Professor John Coolahan.  The group reports bi-annually to me and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The group presents bi-annual report to both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

The overall costs of the scheme have reduced by some 7% since 2008 as a result of policy changes and other efficiencies.</p><p>  In relation to the Department's forward planning policy, school accommodation needs are assessed based on local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  In this regard, it makes sense that children have their eligibility for school transport determined by the distance they reside from their nearest school.</p><p>  The Programme for Government commits to review the concessionary charges and rules element of the School Transport Scheme prior to Budget 2017. </p><p>  This review, which is being commenced, will be aimed at identifying issues in relation to current rules and charges relating to concessionary places under the School Transport Scheme with a view to maximising the effectiveness of available services for children.</p><p>  The results of the review will be considered in the context of Budget 2017.</p><p>  Pending this review, there will be no planned programme of downsizing school buses in the coming school year.  There will be route changes and variations in line with normal operational decisions that occur from year to year, and any impacts in terms of increases or decreases of available places will be marginal, in line with what occurs every year.  </p></reply>

This framework, which was agreed with my Department and the now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has been in operation for many years.  A similar provision to allow Institutes of Technology to borrow is contained in the Institutes of Technology Act, 2006, however this provision has not been enacted.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, universities are classified as outside General Government for Eurostat purposes, while Institutes of Technology are classified as within General Government.  This arises primarily from the difference in funding sources in the two sectors, with the university sector raising a greater proportion of income from non-State sources. </p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the recent economic crisis and continuing constraints on Government as a result of EU fiscal rules on expenditure and debt levels has to date prevented the agreement of a borrowing framework for Institutes of Technology.

In the last five years alone, there has been a significant increase in both undergraduate and postgraduate numbers.  Full-time undergraduate enrolments increased by 11%, part-time undergraduates by 8% and postgraduate enrolments have grown by 8%.</p><p>  The system will have to provide an even greater number of places over the next decade to accommodate a growing cohort of school leavers and to meet continued demand from the labour market for graduates.  The system must be resourced sufficiently and in a sustainable manner to ensure it can meet these demands and deliver on our national ambitions.</p><p>  The Expert Group chaired by Peter Cassells was established to examine funding arrangements for higher education and to present options for developing a sustainable long-term funding strategy for the sector.  The Expert Group has completed its work and its report will allow for a real and meaningful discussion on the funding requirements of the sector and how those requirements should be met.  I intend to publish the report shortly and I will engage with the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills immediately after this as part of the process for formulating a plan for the future of the sector. </p><p>  Specific details on new entrant numbers for full-time undergraduate programmes in each Irish university over the last five years are set out in the following table.  At a sector level, there has been a 5% increase in new entrants since 2011/12.  The number of places offered by an institution is dependent on a number of factors.  The first is student demand and this can vary across regions for demographic and geographical reasons.  It should be noted that while participation rates at third level have increased, there were very low birth rates in the mid-nineties which has resulted in a dip in the number of school leavers in the last number of years.  Secondly, some courses have quotas or limits in place because of specific requirements, or in areas such as medicine or nursing which require clinical training placements and are linked to identified future manpower requirements in the health sector.  </p><p><b>Full-Time New Entrants by University, 2011/12 - 2015/16</b><table><tr><th>Institute</th><th>2011/2012</th><th>2012/2013</th><th>2013/2014</th><th>2014/2015</th><th>2015/2016</th></tr><tr><td>Universities</td><td>19,882</td><td>20,512</td><td>20,206</td><td>20,921</td><td>22,461</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City University</td><td>2,060</td><td>2,302</td><td>2,416</td><td>2,534</td><td>3,413</td></tr><tr><td>National University of Ireland, Galway</td><td>3,017</td><td>3,080</td><td>2,983</td><td>2,991</td><td>3,085</td></tr><tr><td>National University of Ireland, Maynooth</td><td>1,857</td><td>1,963</td><td>2,122</td><td>2,427</td><td>2,563</td></tr><tr><td>Trinity College Dublin</td><td>2,882</td><td>2,835</td><td>2,926</td><td>2,990</td><td>2,939</td></tr><tr><td>University College Cork</td><td>3,846</td><td>3,804</td><td>3,253</td><td>3,512</td><td>3,568</td></tr><tr><td>University College Dublin</td><td>4,115</td><td>4,234</td><td>4,240</td><td>4,207</td><td>4,401</td></tr><tr><td>University of Limerick</td><td>2,105</td><td>2,294</td><td>2,266</td><td>2,260</td><td>2,492</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In preparing this report, the Group engaged in a wide consultation process across education, enterprise, trade unions, and wider interest groups. </p><p>  One of the proposals put forward at that time by a number of institutes of technology was for the creation of a single federal national technological university which appears to be a similar model to the State and City University of New York (SUNY and CUNY) systems.  The proposal for a National Technological university was for a single institution that would encompass all 14 institutes of technology.</p><p>  The Strategy outlined that one of the strengths of higher education in Ireland is the extent to which collaborative behaviour has already developed.  The Strategy outlined that the proposal put forward by a number of institutes of technology for the creation of a single federal national technological university ran counter to that approach.</p><p>  The Strategy also outlined that there are strong arguments against simply making changes to the names of institutions.  Any such changes could, if allowed, lead to confusion internationally as to the roles and mission of Irish institutions.  Any loss of this mission would be detrimental to the breadth of Irish higher education provision and would not serve our longer-term societal needs.</p><p>  Accordingly, with regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, in order to qualify for technological university status, the Strategy recommended that Institutes of Technology would have to merge and to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria before they can apply to be designated as a Technological University. </p><p>  The Government is keen not to replicate the mistakes made in other countries and to avoid a scenario whereby institutes of technology are allowed to become Technological Universities simply as a rebranding exercise, in the process damaging the strengths of the sector, and the national and international reputation of the Irish Higher Education system, built up over many years. </p><p>  Regional Focus:</p><p>There will also be a specific focus on the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society. </p><p>  Consortiums who have applied:</p><p>As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. </p><p>  The designation process consists of four stages as follows &ndash;</p><p>- an expression of interest,</p><p>- the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria,</p><p>- an evaluation of the plan, and</p><p>- an application for designation.</p><p>There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). </p><p>  Position of Technological Universities Bill:</p><p>The first Government Legislative Programme of this new Partnership Government was published on 8 June 2016, and the Technological Universities Bill has been restored to the D&aacute;il Order Paper at Committee Stage. </p><p>  I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders, in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p><p>  Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. </p><p>  The follow-up paper to the Report of the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector which was published in 2014 outlines good practice and options for promoting diversity in all schools.  The paper gives an overview of different types of arrangements that schools have put in place to facilitate those pupils who wish to opt-out of religious education. </p><p>  The paper encourages school authorities to consider their policies and practices and to review whether they are taking the steps necessary to welcome all pupils and make them feel included.  </p><p>I understand that in the case of catholic schools, the Catholic Schools Partnership subsequently published guidelines for catholic schools in relation to the inclusion of all pupils and that this also contains suggestions on how such schools can manage the &quot;opt-out&quot; of religious education. </p><p>  I also believe that difficulties could be avoided if, from the outset, a school's arrangements for those students who do not wish to attend religious instruction are made clear to parents.  In that regard, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new school admissions legislation taking into account current draft proposals. </p><p>  The proposed Admission to Schools Bill includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard. </p><p>  Furthermore a crucial way of dealing with this issue is to provide additional choice to parents and in this regard the Programme for Government includes a commitment to increasing the rate of provision of multi-denominational schools reaching 400 by 2030.</p></reply>

The means test arrangements of the Student Grant Scheme are applied nationally.  The assessment of income from the same starting point is deemed to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households. </p><p>  The decision on eligibility for new student grant applications is a matter for the centralised grant awarding authority, SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland).  When considering whether a student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, grant awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.</p><p>  I understand that SUSI accepts certain documentation from the Department of Social Protection in order to assist an applicant in proving that he/she is living independently at an address.  The documentation must, however, directly relate to the applicant's residence at that address e.g. a letter from the Department of Social Protection confirming that the applicant is receiving rent allowance at that address.  Other forms of correspondence from the Department of Social Protection that may be provided to SUSI by applicants as part of their student grant application do not necessarily require the same level of validation by the Department of Social Protection with regard to the person's residence at a particular address.  However, all documentation received by SUSI as evidence of independent residence is reviewed and decisions are made on a case by case basis, having regard to the evidential value of the documentation submitted, other available evidence and the specific circumstances of each case.</p><p>  If an individual applicant considers that he/she has been unjustly refused a student grant, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, a further appeal can be made by the applicant to the statutory independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p></reply>

All of these actions are governed by the relevant Departmental Technical Guidance Documents which are made available to schools.  The drawdown of funding for projects is subject to certain confirmations provided by a school authority such as that the project has been delivered in accordance with the Department's Technical Guidance Documents, Building Regulations and other statutory approvals.</p>  <p>  The Lead Consultant appointed by a Board of Management is, as the competent professional, the site Manager for the project.  Given the number of devolved projects underway nationwide at any given time (there are approximately 2,000 such projects currently), it would not be feasible for the Department to act as site manager for these projects nor has the OPW any role in these projects.  The need for this, in any event, is obviated by the appointment of a Consultant for the project which is paid for by the Department.</p>  <p>  The Board of Management appointed Cosgrave Consults to design its building and it entered into a contract with Gerard McGrath Contractor as the main contractor for the delivery of the project.  As with all devolved projects, the delivery contract is held in the school by the Board of Management.  Information on the date the contract was signed and on the retention value of the project is accordingly held by the school authority.  The project was completed in August 2007.  The final cost for the project was &euro;902,705 of which the Department funded &euro;771,356.  The school met the remainder of the cost from its own resources.</p>  <p>  The final draw down for the approved funding took place in 2007 and the school provided confirmation of all of the necessary compliances in relation to the building to enable the payment.  There were two further contacts with the school thereafter &ndash; one in 2009 and one in 2011.  There was no mention of any issues with the roof in these contacts.</p>  <p>  The first record that the Department has of potential problems with the roof is an application for funding under the Summer Works Scheme 2016/17.  It is noted that the Consultant's Report accompanying the application was compiled by Cosgrave Consults which was also the firm employed by the school for its new building project.  The application was filed by the closing date for the Scheme in December 2015.  Due to the level of funding available, it was not possible to reach the roof works category for projects approved for 2016.  Valid Summer Works Scheme applications from schools for categories that were not reached under round one approvals will, subject to the overall availability of funding, qualify to be assessed under future rounds of the Scheme.  If this arises, the terms and conditions of the Scheme will continue to apply when allocating funding to such projects.</p>  <p>  On the 21st of June and the 30th of June 2016, the Deputy set down Parliamentary Questions in relation to an Emergency Works application from the school for roof works.  I confirmed to the Deputy in reply to these questions that my Department has no record of receiving this application.</p>  <p>  In the details supplied, the Deputy provided an incomplete Emergency Works Scheme application form.  It appears from that form that the school has now employed a different Consultant for its proposed roof works project.  It is noted that the diagnosis of the issues in the Summer Works Scheme application and what is being prepared for the Emergency Works Scheme application is completely different and widely varying in cost.  This will have to be reconciled by the school.</p>  <p>  However, from the information available in these applications, it appears that the issues arising relate to the original building project.  As such, any defects are a matter for the school, its Design Team and the main contractor.  The school, as the client party to the contract involved, must pursue these entities and or their insurances as necessary to remedy them.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that the school, the Department and the tax paying public have the right to expect that a building delivered under contractual protection will be fully functional and can operate as intended.  It would not be acceptable for the Department to pay again for works that should have been correctly carried out in the first instance and any assessment of the Summer Works Scheme application on hands or any Emergency Works Scheme application subsequently received will have to be considered in this context.</p></reply>

Neither the project for the school to which he refers nor any other project has been removed from that list.</p>  <p>  However, on 1st January 2016 there were 66 major projects under construction.  Since the start of this year 14 more major projects have been progressed to construction and there are currently 36 projects authorised to progress through the tender process with a view to starting on site in the coming months.  That represents a total of 116 major projects either under construction or progressing to commence construction in 2016.  The project for the school referred to was not at a sufficiently advanced stage to be considered for inclusion with those projects when they were authorised to proceed to tender earlier this year.  The existing contractual commitments for 2016 now fully account for the funding allocation available in 2016.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to closely monitor expenditure on existing contractual commitments over the coming months and, as funding allows, other projects, including the project for the school in question will be considered for progression through the tender process with a view to starting on site as soon as possible.</p></reply>

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities.</p><p>There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology).</p><p>Future Funding for landscape reconfiguration in the Higher Education sector:It is recognised that these changes to the landscape of Irish higher education carry some up-front additional costs and the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has provided for a fund to support HEIs with these costs.  In terms of additional financial support, having regard to the benefits that will arise for the institutions, students and the higher education system more generally, the HEA has provided funding in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to provide some support to institutions involved in the TU process, the details of which are set out for each consortium below. </p><p>In relation to 2016, the HEA have ring-fenced a level of funding to support costs arising from the continuation of landscape reform projects as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.  In line with this, the HEA issued a call for submissions for funding support to higher education institutions involved in restructuring projects.</p><p>Funding Allocations: Arising from the submissions received and subsequent detailed presentations made to the HEA, all four consortiums that are involved in merger processes with the ultimate aim of becoming Technological Universities have been allocated additional funding as outlined below.  Part of this funding arises from a specific &euro;2 million allocated in Budget 2016 to support Technological University projects.  Notification of this additional funding was recently provided to the consortiums involved.  The funding for 2016 has been allocated as follows:</p><p>TUSE: &euro;1.445Million</p><p>TU4 Dublin: &euro;1.3Million</p><p>MTU: &euro;1.2Million</p><p>CUA: &euro;0.757Million</p><p>Total: &euro;4.702Million</p><p>Costs:</p><p>Summary of Overall Costs to date:</p><p>Costs incurred to End 2015:</p><p>TU4 Dublin &euro;3,113,000</p><p>MTU &euro;1,053,026</p><p>TUSE &euro;495,655</p><p>CUA  &euro;400,000</p><p>Total  &euro;5,061,681</p><p>Future projections for the overall costs of all of the projects will only be fully determined as part of the Stage 2 and Stage 4 Application processes.</p><p>Position of Technological Universities Bill:</p><p>The first Government Legislative Programme of this new Partnership Government was published on 8 June 2016, and the Technological Universities Bill has been restored to the D&aacute;il Order Paper at Committee Stage.</p><p>I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p><p>Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p><p> As part of this consultation process, the General Secretary of the Teachers' Union of Ireland wrote to me in June 2016 seeking a meeting to discuss relevant issues in regard to the Technological Universities Bill.  I have now arranged to meet with a delegation from the Teachers' Union of Ireland shortly.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  However, this may result in some pupils' not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory, and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  I would like to point out, however, that 80% of schools are not over-subscribed at all.</p><p>Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that, as regards that policy, principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department or, - in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, - to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student, or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p><p>Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on this Departments website at the following link:<i>,</i>or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, phone 0761 108588.</p><p>The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The relevant office can be contacted at: Educational Welfare Service, Child and Family Agency, Floors 2-5, Brunel Building, Heuston South Quarter, Dublin 8.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with Special Educational Needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with Special Educational Needs, including Autism. </p><p>It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.</p><p>Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of Special Educational Needs, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting, but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are currently over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level of which 762 are for children with Autism.  194 of these classes for children with autism are at post primary level. </p><p>With regard to the requirement for post primary school places for children with autism, the NCSE, through its network of local SENOs, have been engaging with schools for 2016/17 school year in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes, in order to ensure there are sufficient placements available to meet demand in an area.</p><p>The NCSE recently published a list of special classes for the 2016/17 school year.  In total there will be 1,153 special classes available next year, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548. 237 of these classes will be for pupils with autism at post primary level, which represents an increase of 22% on 2015/16.</p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy does not have a special class.</p><p>Details of all of the special classes for children with special educational needs which are attached to mainstream schools are published each year on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>The NCSE have advised that for the coming school year there are 2 classes for children with Autism in the local Community School with places currently available in both classes.  Any parent who has concerns about a place for their child for September should contact their local SENO as soon as possible for information on available places.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support. </p>  <p>  Staffing arrangements for special schools are in line with policy advice provided by the NCSE which did not recommend alteration to staffing ratios established under SERC Report in 1993.</p>  <p>  Circular 0042/2011 provides information to schools regarding the staffing arrangements which apply in Special schools. </p>  <p>  The Circular sets out that special schools are staffed based on their pupil profiles and the disability category of the pupils enrolled, as opposed to being based principally on school designation.  Staffing levels therefore reflect the complexity of needs that exist within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, in recognition that many Special schools enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations. </p>  <p>  In determining the staffing allocation for schools, including the above school, the NCSE takes into account up-to-date enrolment and pupil profile information.  School staffing schedules are reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE.  Accordingly, the staffing allocation for the school referred to in the Deputy's question has been calculated to reflect the profile of pupils currently enrolled in the school, in accordance with each pupil's disability categorisation. </p>  <p>  The NCSE have confirmed that following considering of additional information in relation to the school's staffing allocation for 2016/17, an additional teaching post has been sanctioned for the school to which the Deputy refers.  The NCSE has advised the school of the outcome accordingly.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme and applies to all existing local authority houses, other than those classes of houses excluded under legislation.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  The terms of the Scheme involve discounts of 40%, 50% or 60% off the purchase price of the house, linked to tenant income.  On the sale of a house under the Scheme, the housing authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount involved. </p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Directions issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who live in the house with them.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant. </p>  <p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it and all dwellings connected to the public water or waste water systems will remain liable for domestic water charges up to the date the suspension of charges takes effect.</p>  <p>  Section 3(A)(9) of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that a person who is a tenant of a dwelling let under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2014 and who proposes to purchase the dwelling shall, before completion of the sale, provide the local authority concerned with a certificate of discharge from Irish Water confirming that any water charge in respect of the dwelling owed to Irish Water has been paid.  The sale of the dwelling cannot proceed until a certificate of discharge in respect of the dwelling has been received from Irish Water.  I have no plans to amend the legislation in this regard. </p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the new Programme for a Partnership Government I intend to undertake a review of the 2016 scheme following the first 12 months of operation.  I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage. </p></reply>

Local authorities have been requested to designate areas as not being suitable for wheelie bin collections (i.e. designate areas which should remain on bag collections) and are working through this process.</p><p>In brief, the criteria for undertaking the exercise to designate &lsquo;bag collection areas&rsquo; are as follows:</p><p>- No space within the boundary of the property (front, rear or side) to store 3 bins.</p><p>- Physical features which make it difficult to move a bin to the front edge of the property or nearest boundary for presentation, e.g. steep gradient and or steps (the advice of a Roads Engineer should be sought) or that would present an unreasonable difficulty.</p><p>- The area (e.g. street) is too narrow for a refuse collection vehicle to access properties and the nearest Designated Collection Point or suitable presentation point is greater than 100m from the property (again, the advice of a Roads Engineer should be sought on this issue).</p><p>- Where the Local Authority is notified of exceptional circumstances by a householder / resident and the Local Authority certifies same.</p><p>Many local authorities have now completed the process of designating areas where bag collections may continue, if applicable, and should be contacted for further information. </p><p>It is important to note that while pay by weight is not being introduced on a mandatory basis, it is open to collectors to charge on a pay-by-weight basis, as many already do.  Approximately 20% of households are already on a pay-by- weight charge of some form and are happy with that service. </p><p>The issue of households who have moved from bags to bins in the context of the current agreements will be discussed with industry this week.  Notwithstanding the difficulties associated with trying to accommodate customers who use bags and in respect of whom the collector has no data on last year&rsquo;s weights or usage, I am confident that a reasonable and fair solution will be found to address this issue. </p></reply>

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LAMTR ).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB MTR ).</p><p>My Department makes financial support available to AHB&rsquo;s to fund MTR transactions using capital advanced through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF).  The CALF facility is exclusively available to AHB&rsquo;s to assist them in accessing private finance or Housing Agency Finance to purchase MTR units.  Included in a recent package of amendments to the AHB MTR scheme was an increase in the ceiling of support available under CALF for AHB MTR cases from 30% to 40%.  Under the LA MTR scheme, my Department recoups the full acquisition cost to local authorities.</p><p>Both schemes assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process. </p><p>The combined allocation for both schemes is set out in the following table, with the appropriate expenditure for each year.  While the AHB MTR scheme was launched in June 2012 no expenditure was incurred that year.  The LA MTR scheme commenced as a pilot in 2013 in Westmeath County and Dublin City Councils and rolled out nationally in February 2014.</p><p>In 2015, savings from other capital subheads were used to provide additional funding to meet the demand for the LA MTR scheme.  In 2016, the MTR allocation increased by 70% to &euro;17m.  Final 2016 MTR expenditure will be published in due course.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s forthcoming Action Plan for Housing, my Department will examine how Mortgage to Rent can be improved to ensure that more households in distress can avail of the scheme. </p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year </b></th><th><b>MTR allocation</b></th><th><b>LA</b> <b> </b> <b>MTR Expenditure</b></th><th><b>AHB MTR Expenditure</b></th><th><b>Total MTR expenditure</b></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>&euro;</b></td><td><b>&euro;</b></td><td><b>&euro;</b></td><td><b>&euro;</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>2013</b></td><td>12 ,000,000 </td><td>1,572,683</td><td>226,567  </td><td>1,799,250  </td></tr><tr><td><b>2014</b></td><td>7 ,000,000 </td><td>6,515,133</td><td>381,098  </td><td>6,896,231 </td></tr><tr><td><b>2015</b></td><td>10 ,000,000 </td><td>14,815,417 </td><td>780,131  </td><td>15,595,548 </td></tr><tr><td><b>2016</b></td><td>17 ,000,000 </td><td>166,517</td><td>147,122  </td><td>313,639 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under the Local Government Act 2001, a decision to borrow money is a reserved function of the elected members of a local authority.  Section 106 of the Act provides that, in order to undertake borrowing, local authorities must obtain the sanction of the appropriate Minister.  Local authorities applying to my Department for loan sanction are required, as a pre-condition to borrowing, to ensure that they achieve balanced revenue and capital accounts and to demonstrate how the loan will be serviced by the authority.  My Department has not classified the borrowings of any local authority as unsustainable nor has any authority indicated to my Department that they believe their borrowings to be unsustainable. </p><p>The total loans payable by each local authority at end 2014 based on audited Annual Financial Statements are as follows:<table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>2014 Loans outstanding &euro; </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council </td><td>45,857,903 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council </td><td>18,592,834 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council </td><td>97,548,382 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td>148,194,542 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td>426,497,964 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council </td><td>136,795,154 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td>637,703,649 </td></tr><tr><td>DLR County Council </td><td>150,679,876 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td>416,064,917 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council </td><td>81,637,737 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td>53,108,775 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council </td><td>85,054,498 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council </td><td>125,499,719 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td>39,919,413 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council </td><td>114,750,225 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council </td><td>7,393,563 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council </td><td>79,148,544 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council </td><td>41,103,418 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td>157,187,491 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council </td><td>119,928,557 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council </td><td>88,374,283 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council </td><td>23,561,705 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td>65,815,150 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council </td><td>15,977,008 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council </td><td>105,508,672 </td></tr><tr><td>Sth Dublin County Council </td><td>228,705,121 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council </td><td>111,209,345 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council </td><td>130,067,420 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council </td><td>84,093,101 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council </td><td>137,619,278 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council </td><td>91,089,894 </td></tr><tr><td>Total Loan Book </td><td>4,064,688,138 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.</p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, not yet commenced, provides for the introduction of a national differential rents framework that will harmonise local authority rent levels, while retaining some discretion for individual authorities to set rents in their own areas.  My Department is currently refining its proposals for such a framework, which will include a standard method of calculation of income for the purpose of the setting of rent.</p></reply>

The Public Service Reform Oversight Group was established to oversee the work programme of the PMO, ensure strategic alignment with the Government&rsquo;s public service reform agenda and continue the drive for efficiencies in the local government sector.</p>  <p>  Examples of this innovation include the shared payroll service MyPay, which is operational in most of the local authorities in the country, the Building Control Management System, which is an online certificate application and monitoring portal, and the establishment of a Procurement Office, which is developing procurement enabling software and introducing best practice in this field in cooperation with the national Office of Government Procurement. </p>  <p>  Efficiency review is a continuous process within the local authority sector and will deliver further initiatives on an ongoing basis which reflect best practice internationally, resulting in better service delivery for the citizen while reducing costs.   </p>  <p>  I understand that the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) recently published progress reports by the PMO on the implementation of public service efficiency reforms recommended by the 2010 Local Government Efficiency Review and on shared services projects which were among the initiatives implemented in the local government sector as part of these reforms.

There are currently more than 10,700 households being supported by the scheme.  In order to set the HAP limits at informed, practical and appropriate levels my Department has worked closely with the Department of Social Protection during the recent review of rent supplement limits, and examined data gathered through the HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) and related correspondence from local authorities.</p><p>With the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have set the maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced at levels that are generally identical to those for the rent supplement scheme set by the Minister for Social Protection.  The ability of local authorities to meet housing need through the HAP scheme is being further enhanced by the extension of the discretionary ability of authorities to agree to payments that exceed rent limits by up to a maximum of 20%, where justified and required.  The Homeless HAP pilot retains its previously defined enhanced flexibility to exceed the rent limits under the scheme.</p><p>The increased limits are available to local authorities in their determination of appropriate levels of support from 1 July 2016 and are listed in the following table:<table><tr><th><div>- <br /><br />  <br /><br />  </div></th><th colspan="7"><div>Household class </div></th></tr><tr><td>Local authority administrative area<br /><br />(1)</td><td>One adult in shared accommodation <br /><br /> (2)</td><td>A couple in shared accommodation <br /><br /> (3)</td><td>One adult <br /><br />  (4)</td><td>A couple <br /><br />  (5)</td><td>One adult, or a couple, with 1 child <br /><br />  (6)</td><td>One adult, or a couple, with 2 children <br /><br />  (7)</td><td>One adult, or a couple, with 3 children <br /><br />  (8)</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Carlow County Council</td><td><br /><br />&euro; - 270</td><td><br /><br />&euro; - 290</td><td><br /><br />&euro; - 440</td><td><br /><br />&euro; - 510</td><td><br /><br />&euro; - 570</td><td><br /><br />&euro; - 600</td><td><br /><br />&euro; - 630</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council </td><td>220 </td><td>240 </td><td>360 </td><td>400 </td><td>480 </td><td>515 </td><td>550 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td>300 </td><td>330 </td><td>550 </td><td>650 </td><td>900 </td><td>925 </td><td>950 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td>300 </td><td>330 </td><td>550 </td><td>650 </td><td>900 </td><td>925 </td><td>950 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council </td><td>200 </td><td>230 </td><td>340 </td><td>370 </td><td>410 </td><td>470 </td><td>520 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council* </td><td>430 </td><td>500 </td><td>660 </td><td>900 </td><td>1,250 </td><td>1,275 </td><td>1,300 </td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire- Rathdown County Council* </td><td>430 </td><td>500 </td><td>660 </td><td>900 </td><td>1,250 </td><td>1,275 </td><td>1,300 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council* </td><td>400 </td><td>440 </td><td>660 </td><td>900 </td><td>1,150 </td><td>1,175 </td><td>1,200 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td>330 </td><td>360 </td><td>575 </td><td>650 </td><td>850 </td><td>875 </td><td>900 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td>230 </td><td>270 </td><td>480 </td><td>530 </td><td>630 </td><td>660 </td><td>690 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City and County Council </td><td>270 </td><td>300 </td><td>420 </td><td>450 </td><td>650 </td><td>700 </td><td>750 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td>310 </td><td>350 </td><td>575 </td><td>650 </td><td>975 </td><td>1,050 </td><td>1,100 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council </td><td>200 </td><td>220 </td><td>390 </td><td>410 </td><td>480 </td><td>500 </td><td>520 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council </td><td>200 </td><td>220 </td><td>330 </td><td>390 </td><td>500 </td><td>515 </td><td>530 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td>210 </td><td>230 </td><td>380 </td><td>435 </td><td>550 </td><td>575 </td><td>600 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council </td><td>220 </td><td>250 </td><td>460 </td><td>490 </td><td>550 </td><td>575 </td><td>600 </td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council </td><td>430 </td><td>500 </td><td>660 </td><td>900 </td><td>1,250 </td><td>1,275 </td><td>1,300 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council </td><td>210 </td><td>230 </td><td>380 </td><td>420 </td><td>525 </td><td>560 </td><td>600 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council </td><td>240 </td><td>270 </td><td>430 </td><td>450 </td><td>550 </td><td>575 </td><td>600 </td></tr></table>*these rates are available as a basis for the homeless HAP Pilot </p></reply>

Child Benefit is an important source of income for all families and in Budget 2016 the Government increased Child Benefit by &euro;5 per month, at a cost of &euro;72 million.</p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  </p><p>The cost of extending child benefit to 18 year olds in second level education is estimated at &euro;62.5 million.  As child benefit is a universal payment, this proposal would not be targeted.  Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p><p>- qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children;</p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p><p>Extending Child Benefit to students who are in full-time secondary education and who have reached 18 years of age can be examined between now and the budget with the caveat that there are potentially other areas of need that also have to be accounted for.</p><p>Any changes to the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, therefore, would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.8 billion.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that periods of unemployment are a normal feature of the acting and artistic professions and people in these professions can qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment when they are unemployed.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments compensate for periods of involuntary unemployment only and it is not the function of my Department to provide income support through the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes to any group, including artists during periods of unemployment, which are involuntary.  For this reason, social welfare legislation provides that all jobseekers must satisfy certain qualifying conditions in order to be entitled to an unemployment payment including, being available for full-time work and be genuinely seeking work.  The legislation does not impose any restriction or limitation on the right of a person to the opportunity to engage in the employment of his or her choice.  All unemployed persons should avail of reasonable employment opportunities and Artists are treated no differently to any other unemployed person.  My Department&rsquo;s INTREO service now provides a more focussed service to those in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, including artists.</p>  <p>  My Department has no plans to introduce new sector specific working age payments that provide exemptions to be available for and genuinely seeking employment.</p>  <p>  It is essential to the sustainability and integrity of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes that these criteria remain a core feature of the State&rsquo;s supports for the unemployed.</p></reply>

If their application for Supplementary Welfare Allowance is not successful, they can also appeal that decision.  Supplementary Welfare Allowance appeals are prioritised for attention within the Social Welfare Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission are received from the Department.</p>  <p>  The unprecedented increase in overall appeal receipts since 2009 placed considerable pressure on the appeals office and impacted adversely on processing times.  The number of appeals received increased from an average of 15,000 per year up to 2009, to a peak of 35,500 in 2012, reducing annually thereafter to just below 25,000 in 2015.</p>  <p>  Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process in recent years:</p>  <p>  - Additional appeals officers were appointed to the office</p>  <p>  - An overhaul of the operating model was undertaken</p>  <p>  - New technology to support appeals officers was introduced</p>  <p>  - Work was undertaken with the Department to reduce delays in responding to requests from the appeals office for appeal submissions.</p>  <p>  This resulted in a marked improvement in overall appeal processing times.  The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.  This downward trend in overall appeal processing times has continued to date in 2016 to 23.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 17.2 weeks for a summary decision.  </p>  <p>  The improvement is also reflected in processing times for carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals where the average time taken to determine a carer&rsquo;s allowance appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 57.9 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and to 22.4 weeks to date in 2016.  The average time taken to finalise a carer&rsquo;s allowance appeal decided by way of a summary decision has reduced from 31.3 weeks in 2011 to 20.6 weeks in 2015 and to 18.2 weeks to date in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information up to and including the oral hearing.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal, which require a high level of judgement and often involve complex legal questions.  </p>  <p>  A number of elements within the process are time-consuming including the need to ensure due process, natural justice and compliance with the statutory obligation to obtain the Department&rsquo;s appeal submission.  If an oral hearing is requested by the appellant or is required to resolve conflicts, the processing time is prolonged</p>  <p>  The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that appeals processing times are continuously monitored and that, although significant progress has been made in reducing appeal processing times in recent years, continued improvement in this area remains a priority. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Many of these companies are also funded from other sources and generate revenue from the public use of their facilities and services.  The contribution from the CSP is towards the wage costs of the companies and is on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection  does not set the wage rate but requires the payment of appropriate wage rates, consistent with local norms.  In 2015, 398 companies received a contribution towards the wage costs of just over 1,700 employees.  The funding is managed and administered on behalf of the Department by Pobal.</p>  <p>  Due to the increase in the national minimum wage from 1st January 2016, the issue of the sustainability of some CSP funded companies has come into sharper focus.  In response, the my Department has established a CSP Support Fund for a fixed period of time (2016-2018) to assist existing services funded under the programme in enhancing their sustainability as social enterprises so that they might be more able to pay the new minimum wage. </p>  <p>  Appraisals of submissions from companies under the fund have now been completed and the recommendations have been approved by the Department.  Pobal will be communicating the outcomes to each company over the next week and arranging for the payments to issue.</p></reply>

Entitlement to these supports is not contingent on the nature of the illness but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  In all cases a deciding officer of my Department makes a decision based on all the available evidence including supporting medical evidence supplied by the applicant and taking into account the opinion of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessor.</p>  <p>  -  Illness Benefit (IB) is an insurance based payment for those who are certified by a registered medical practitioner as being is unable to work due to illness.  In legislation this day is defined as a "day of incapacity for work".  In order to qualify a person must also satisfy the social insurance contribution conditions for the scheme.</p>  <p>  -  Invalidity Pension is an insurance based payment for those who are permanently incapable of work.  In  addition to satisfying the PRSI contribution conditions, a person must have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and be likely to be incapable of work for at least another 12 months, or be permanently incapable of work.</p>  <p>  -  Disability Allowance is a means tested social assistance payment.  In order to satisfy the conditions for receipt of disability allowance (DA) a person must be suffering from an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect which has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for a period of at least a year and as a result of the condition the person is substantially restricted in undertaking work which would otherwise be suitable having regard to the person&rsquo;s age, experience and qualifications.  There are additional conditions that must be satisfied in relation to habitual residence.</p>  <p>  -  There are a number of other illness support payments associated with the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, including; Injury Benefit,  Disablement Benefit, Incapacity Supplement, Constant Attendance Allowance and the Medical Care Scheme.</p>  <p>  I trust that this answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

CE also provides training and development to participants.  The current eligibility criteria for the programme have been expanded over the years.  The criteria have been set to specifically target certain groups for the programme.  The basic eligibility requirement is that a person is currently in receipt of a CE-qualifying payment from the Department of Social Protection for the requisite period of time, for example jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for a minimum period of twelve months. </p>  <p>  Recent changes to the eligibility criteria for CE include the reduction in the entry age for CE participants working directly with service users in the childcare sector and social/healthcare sector to 21 years of age.  The standard minimum entry age for CE is 25 years of age.  The eligibility criteria for participants aged 62 and over have been eased in terms of the maximum duration they can remain on the programme, subject to certain conditions.  Customers who are not eligible for the CE programme may be eligible for other interventions from the Department. </p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for CE are kept under review to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and that there is the maximum utilisation of CE places.</p>  <p>  However, with the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, I believe that a review of work schemes, including CE, is necessary to ensure that the number and nature of schemes and the conditions governing participation continue to be appropriate.  The Deputy did raise this issue in the House recently and I have asked for your suggested changes to be looked into.  I will be considering the various reforms of CE eligibility proposed by the Deputy in this context over the coming months.</p></reply>

It is designed to be a temporary fixed-term activation intervention.  The programme assists participants to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills which can then be used in the workplace.  The overall number of places on CE is limited to 25,300 in 2016.</p>  <p>  CE is open to participants aged up to 65 years of age who meet the current eligibility criteria.  A pilot initiative was introduced in December 2015 to enable those aged 62 and over to extend their participation beyond the standard maximum participation limits (currently set at 6 years cumulative lifetime participation) providing the eligibility conditions are met.  Participants aged 62 and over, are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the state pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.  The places allocated for participants over 62 years within each individual CE scheme are limited to 7% of each scheme&rsquo;s overall budgeted places.  This limit allows for the maximum utilisation of the remaining places on the scheme for the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups in line with the scheme aims.  An adjustment to enable all CE participants over 60 years of age to remain until retirement age would cause the percentage of such places to increase continuously which has the consequence of reducing the number of places available to all other target cohorts.  As this initiative was only introduced at the end of December 2015, I am satisfied that the limit of 7% should remain.</p>  <p>  However, with the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, I believe that a review of work schemes, including CE, will be necessary to ensure that the number and nature of schemes and the conditions governing participation continue to be appropriate.

Payments made in respect of life assurance  policies, including mortgage protection policies, are not deducted from earnings for means assessment purposes.</p><p>With regards to property and capital, social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property (including capital) owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means testing purposes.  Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the family home a person is personally using or enjoying i.e. residing in or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>The current assessment method, involving a disregard of an initial amount of capital and an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount, came into effect in October 2000 for most welfare schemes.  The assessment formula is not designed to mirror potential interest or annuity rates available to investors or potential rental income from a property and no account is taken of any such income in the overall means assessment.  The formula introduced in 2000 continued and enhanced the policy of ensuring that those with property and capital of modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support while those with larger amounts of capital are in a position to avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs. </p><p>This property/capital formula applies regardless of the type of capital (including monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares or property). Insurance policies, such as mortgage protection policies, are not assessable as capital.</p><p>The assessment formula for most schemes, including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for entitlement to increases for qualified adults for social insurance schemes, was last updated in 2005 &ndash; see following table - and included an increase in the initial amount disregarded from &euro;12,697 to &euro;20,000.<table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>For the purposes of the State pension non-contributory and carer&rsquo;s allowance the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple.  From 2007, the amount disregarded in the case of disability allowance is &euro;50,000, up from &euro;20,000, and in the case of supplementary welfare allowance is &euro;5,000, up from &euro;520. </p><p>The general rule for assessment of pension funds or annuities is:</p><p>-  Regular pension payments are treated as income for means purposes;</p><p>-  The value of any cash otherwise available from a pension fund is assessed on the basis of the capital valuation of that fund; and</p><p>-  Money invested in a pension fund is not assessable if it is not accessible to the claimant. </p><p>Any change to the means assessment of social assistance schemes would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-05a.797.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500074#WRM04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 308 and 320 together.</p>  <p>  These new rent limits reflect the fact that rents are rising and are back to their peak levels in some cases.  Through a combination of increased rent limits, and the ongoing flexibility and discretionary increases provided by my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service staff, we will provide more stability for tenants and reduce the danger of families becoming homeless when their rent is increased.</p>  <p>  This Government wants to ensure that our recovering economy works for everyone.  We aim to achieve that by promoting an enterprise economy, making work pay, investing in public services, ensuring opportunity and a fair go for everyone.  We must ensure that we have a strong safety net so that everyone has a roof over their head.  In many cases, Rent Supplement or Housing Assistance Payment is that safety net.</p>  <p>  The revised increased rent limits under the rent supplement scheme, as announced last week, were introduced with effect from Friday, 1 July 2016.  Supports in relation to housing and the provision of financial supports, including the rent supplement scheme currently supporting some 54,000 recipients at a cost of &euro;267 million in 2016, are a key priority as evidenced by the early implementation of this Government commitment. </p>  <p>  The review sets the rent limits in line with market rents which have generally been benchmarked at the 35th percentile of agreed rents as registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.  A weighted average increase of some 30% has been applied across both the rent limits previously in place in the Fingal and Non-Fingal areas of Dublin. </p>  <p>  The most recent rent supplement review showed that there remained a price differential between Fingal and Non-Fingal Dublin areas though both experienced a uniform increase in their overall rental pricing. </p>  <p>  I have also advised that people who have entered an informal top-up arrangement with their landlord to contact their Community Welfare Service for assistance, as the Department will regularise these top-ups in most cases.  The primary concern will be to ensure the tenant&rsquo;s accommodation needs are met and that they have sufficient social welfare income after their accommodation needs have been paid.  Guidance has issued to officers regarding the implementation of the increased rent limits including top up arrangements.  The new limits, combined with the continued flexible approach provided by the Community Welfare Service and the Tenancy Protection Service, operated by Threshold, will provide for increased security for persons seeking support under this scheme.</p>  <p>  Policy responsibility for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  T&uacute;s is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market.  Initially all participants were randomly selected by the Department.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the T&uacute;s initiative was further developed to allow for an assisted referral process for up to 20% of participants.  This allows jobseekers to apply to be considered for recruitment to the initiative.  In such cases the application from eligible jobseekers will be mediated through a case officer in my Department.</p>  <p>  Currently, I am satisfied that random selection should remain the main referral process and that 80% of referrals in all locations will continue to be selected in this way.  However, with the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, I believe that a review of work schemes, including T&uacute;s, will be necessary to ensure that the number and nature of schemes and the conditions governing participation continue to be appropriate.  I will be considering all of these issues over the coming months.</p></reply>

The use of a means test is to ensure that scarce resources are directed to those in greatest need.  </p>  <p>  Payments from the United Kingdom (UK) are assessed as income under current legislation.  If the person applying for a Social Assistance payment has a UK pension, it is assessable, together with all other means such as savings and investments, when determining the rate of payment.  In assessing means derived from payments received from non-European Monetary Union (EMU) States, the Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers.  Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter.  This rate is then used in all conversions during the course of the succeeding quarter.  The exchange rates for converting sterling and other non EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The Department obtains this rate at the beginning of each quarter.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of the UK referendum, negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU will take time.  In the interim, it is important to stress that all payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including those to recipients who are resident in Britain and Northern Ireland, and payments from the UK to residents in Ireland, will continue to be paid.</p>  <p>  My Department is keeping the currency situation under review.  In the event that serious currency fluctuation should arise, resulting in significant negative impact for means-tested pensioners, the Department will take steps to adjust and rebalance the amounts payable to these pensioners to minimise the possibility of hardship.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Over 1,200 loans have been drawn down under the Scheme to date with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down is &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments are then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the roll-out and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme.

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2016 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of &euro;85 million on the farm assist scheme.</p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed people.  Farm families with the lowest income were least impacted by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.</p>  <p>  Farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme, the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme or the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme are assessed separately from other farm income.  Farm Assist remains a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash flow issues, due for example to bad weather, can ask his/her local INTREO office to review the level of means applying to his/her claim.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains the commitment to undertake a "Review of the Farm Assist Scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low incomes".  I have asked my officials to review the farm assist scheme from a policy and an administrative point of view.  This review has commenced and its outcome may be considered in the context of Budget 2017 subject to the overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

These Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  I had the opportunity to draw attention to these outstanding commitments last week at the Review Meeting of the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.</p>  <p>  The matter of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved one and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and, in particular, of the recently appointed Minister for Communities Paul Givan MLA.  A public consultation process on an Irish Language Bill was held in 2015 following on from the launch of a 20 year Strategy for both Irish and Ulster Scots in January that year.  The Government is closely following progress on this and continues to advocate for an Irish Language Act and to encourage those who currently support an Act to continue to build the necessary enabling consensus among their Executive colleagues. </p>  <p>  In the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, the Government and the British Government, recalling the commitments from previous Agreements, endorsed the need for respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland, consistent with the Council of Europe Charter on Regional or Minority Languages. </p>  <p>  Of course the Irish Government continues to support the work of Foras na Gaeilge whose objective is the promotion of the Irish language on an all-island basis and my own Department has also provided support, through its Reconciliation Fund, to number of projects promoting the use of the Irish language on a cross community basis within Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  With the establishment in 2012 of the North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association, which is in effect the North/South Parliamentary Forum envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement, the only Strand Two institution that remains outstanding is the North/South Consultative Forum.  The Government continues to support the establishment of the Consultative Forum and the Taoiseach has raised the Forum at successive Plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  On a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, the Government advanced the view during the 2014 Stormont House talks, that a Bill of Rights could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared society for Northern Ireland could be based.  While there was not sufficient consensus to take this forward, the final Agreement did provide that the parties commit to:</p>  <p>   &ldquo;serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to act in accordance with the obligations on government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination; to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage shared and integrated education and housing, social inclusion, and in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life; and to promote the interests of the whole community towards the goals of reconciliation and economic renewal&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The implementation provisions of the Stormont House Agreement provide for regular review meetings with the participation of the Government, the British Government and the Executive party leaders.  Through these review meetings, I have and will continue to seek the implementation of all aspects of the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements, including those outstanding commitments from the Good Friday and St Andrews&rsquo; agreements. </p>  <p>  As the Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear, we are also determined to pursue the outstanding commitment for a full public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane as agreed by the British and Irish Governments in the Weston Park Agreement of 2001.  This is something which the Government has continued to pursue through the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government and the Executive, to ensure that the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements is realised towards achieving effective partnership government, genuine reconciliation and economic prosperity for all in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

These include the maintenance of a comprehensive ceasefire and the withdrawal of all heavy weapons from the contact line.  The absence of a stable ceasefire is hampering ongoing efforts to advance key provisions of the agreements, in particular the holding of local elections in Donetsk and Luhansk in accordance with OSCE standards and the passing by the Ukraine parliament of a law granting a special status to the regions.</p>  <p>  Given the lack of progress in implementing the Minsk agreements to date, Ireland supported the decision to roll over the sanctions until 31 January 2017. </p></reply>

The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report fundamentally vindicates the concerns the families have raised over many years and their continuing search for justice. </p>  <p>  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s findings are deeply disturbing; in particular his determination that &ldquo;collusion is a significant feature of the Loughinisland murders&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The report must be carefully examined with a view to the question of further investigations and possible prosecutions.  The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has made clear that the PSNI remains firmly committed to investigating any leads that arise that could lead to prosecutions of those responsible for these appalling sectarian murders.</p>  <p>  Despite its disturbing findings, the report is an important reminder of the central importance of the Police Ombudsman in supporting public confidence in the new policing arrangements in Northern Ireland, as envisaged in the Patten Report.  I welcome the full cooperation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland with the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s investigation.</p>  <p>  Cases involving collusion such as the Loughinisland Massacre, must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled society.  Successive Irish Governments, in our ongoing bilateral relations with the UK and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, have consistently raised the issue of collusion with the British Government, and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  I raised the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report into the Loughinisland killings during my bilateral meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last week.  Secretary of State Villiers also welcomed the report, noted her support for the work of the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland, and echoed the concern over the Ombudsman&rsquo;s finding that collusion was a &lsquo;significant feature&rsquo; in the murders.  The Secretary of State and I agreed that cases such as these serve as a stark reminder of the need to agree mechanisms for dealing with the painful legacy of the past in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, both Governments remain committed to the establishment of the Stormont House legacy institutions as soon as possible and continue to work to achieve this with the Northern Ireland Executive and opposition political parties, as well as broader society. </p>  <p>  This determination is underscored by the Government&rsquo;s view that the comprehensive provisions of the Stormont House Agreement for dealing with the legacy of the past offer the best prospect of bringing whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles &ndash; including those affected by collusion.  For this to be achieved, it is vitally important that the envisaged legacy institutions would have the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families.  Their needs will therefore remain central to the Government&rsquo;s approach in this area.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that agreement can be reached on the outstanding issues in the near future and that work can finally get underway on establishing the legacy institutions.</p></reply>

This commitment is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government that was agreed in May.</p>  <p>  The all-Party D&aacute;il motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombing that was adopted in this House on 25 May has been conveyed to the British Government.  This motion, like the two previously adopted in 2008 and 2011, calls on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombing atrocities.  To this end, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in late May, conveying a copy of the recent resolution.  In addition, I raised the matter in my bilateral meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Belfast last week.  In this meeting I advised the Secretary of State that this latest motion represents the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  I underlined that the absence of a response from the British Government was of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House and emphasised the urgent need to respond to the three D&aacute;il motions.  Secretary of State Villiers recognised the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case and she indicated that the British Government is considering a response which would adequately address the motions. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to raise this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  I have made clear to the Secretary of State that there is a pressing need to provide answers to the families of the victims.  The Taoiseach has also raised this issue with Prime Minister Cameron emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.</p>  <p>  Many families continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage with the British Government, the Executive and the Northern Ireland political parties in discussions to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  The Government believes that the legacy institutions agreed under the Stormont House Agreement offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families impacted by the Troubles.  I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

We recommended that Israel end urgently night arrests of Palestinian children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation. </p>  <p>  Bilaterally, our concerns regarding the detention of Palestinian minors have been raised as part of our ongoing dialogue with the Israeli authorities on the overall situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel&rsquo;s treatment of the Palestinian population, both with the Israeli Embassy here and through our own Embassy in Tel Aviv.</p>  <p>  My clear view is that Palestinian children should be afforded the same rights and protections under the law which Israel rightly considers to be appropriate for Israeli children living alongside them.</p>  <p>  The overall human rights situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the treatment of children in detention, remains a matter of concern and will continue to be raised in the relevant multilateral fora, and to feature in the EU&rsquo;s broader concerns about human rights in the area. </p>  <p>  Similar concerns would exist in relation to the detention of children in many other states in the region."</p></reply>

Shortly after the conclusion of the Fresh Start Agreement, which did not succeed in reaching full agreement on all these issues, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, and I agreed that there was merit in proceeding in a way that involved victims&rsquo; groups and civic society.</p>  <p>  To that end, I wrote to the Northern Ireland Political Parties and over 50 victims&rsquo; groups in January this year.  I included with my letter the Government&rsquo;s policy paper on dealing with the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland and invited groups to respond with their thoughts and ideas on ways to move forward on this issue.  Furthermore, officials from my Department met with over 20 victims&rsquo; groups, from across the community in Northern Ireland, as well as groups representing victims and survivors of the Troubles from this jurisdiction and Britain.  The purpose of this engagement was to discuss the legacy institutions and listen to perspectives on their establishment and future operation.  Secretary of State Villiers and officials from the Northern Ireland Office held their own round of consultation meetings.</p>  <p>  Both Governments remain committed to the establishment of the Stormont House legacy institutions as soon as possible and continue to work to achieve this outcome &ndash; engaging both with the Northern Ireland Executive and opposition political parties, as well as broader society. </p>  <p>  This determination is underscored by the Government&rsquo;s view that the comprehensive provisions of the Stormont House Agreement for dealing with the legacy of the past offer the best prospect of bringing whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles.  For this to be achieved, it is vitally important that the envisaged legacy institutions would have the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families.  Their needs will therefore remain central to the Government&rsquo;s approach in this area.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that agreement can be reached on the outstanding issues in the near future and that work can finally get underway on establishing the legacy institutions.  We owe this to the many victims and survivors of the Troubles.</p></reply>

Freedom of religion and belief, of expression and of assembly are not always upheld, and there are particular concerns about the treatment of some religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, journalists and bloggers, and human rights defenders.  Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of our engagement and dialogue with Iran.</p>  <p>  The intolerance and persecution of Baha&rsquo;i by the Iranian authorities, which has continued at varying levels of intensity throughout the existence of the Islamic Republic, is a grave reproach to Iran and its reputation, and a matter of deep concern.</p>  <p>  In March 2015, I addressed the UN Human Rights Council and expressed my concern that &ldquo;Freedom of Religion and Belief is in peril in many places worldwide, with members of minority religious communities, including those of Christian, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i faith, disproportionately affected by violence, discrimination, and harassment.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I am aware that seven Baha&rsquo;i leaders remain in detention in Iran, and that a further 73 Baha&rsquo;is are imprisoned there solely on the basis of their religious beliefs.  I am aware that people of the Baha&rsquo;i faith in Iran are routinely discriminated against, and persecuted on a daily basis.  Ireland will continue to call, through bilateral contacts, with our EU partners and at the UN, for the release of those Baha&rsquo;i imprisoned on the basis of their faith, and for Iran to cease persecuting members of the Baha&rsquo;i community.  Ireland has been instrumental in ensuring that the EU consistently raise the discriminatory treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i in Iran, and will continue to ensure that this remains firmly on the political agenda.</p>  <p>  My Department engaged in political consultations with Iran in January 2015 here in Dublin, and took this opportunity to directly communicate Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i community to the visiting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Majid Takht Ravanchi.  </p>  <p>  I personally voiced these concerns directly to Mr. Ali Larijani, the Speaker of the Majlis (Iranian Parliament), during his visit to Ireland in June 2015.</p>  <p>  Iran was reviewed under the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review process in 2014.  Ireland raised concerns in its intervention regarding the situation of religious minorities.  We recommended that Iran review its policies discriminating against students on account of their faith, ensure that the trials of members of religious minorities are conducted in a fair and transparent manner, and accord to these people the full rights of citizens of Iran. </p>  <p>  At the 28th Session of the Human Rights Council in March 2015, during the interactive dialogues with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Iran, and the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Ireland raised concerns that some groups, including those of the Baha&rsquo;i faith and some Christian groups, are subject to significant persecution.  We also raised this concern at the 27th Session of the Human Rights Council in 2014, under Agenda Item Four (human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention). </p>  <p>  My Department also maintains contact with the Irish Baha&rsquo;i community, through meetings and regular correspondence.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland, along with the EU, will continue to encourage progress in relation to religious minorities in Iran, in particular regarding those of the Baha&rsquo;i faith, and to make clear our concerns to the Iranian authorities at every appropriate opportunity.</p></reply>

I also commend former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Eamon Gilmore, for his ongoing work as the European Union&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the Colombian Peace Process.  Mr. Gilmore was the EU&rsquo;s representative at the signing ceremony in Havana on 26 June 2016.</p>  <p>  A central element of the bilateral ceasefire agreement is the commitment by the Government of Colombia to intensify its fight against paramilitarism and organised crime, as well as stepping up its protection of rural communities, social movements such as ASTRACATOL and opposition political movements and parties.  In addition, the Colombian government has pledged to establish a National Commission on Security Guarantees and a Special Unit, within the Public Prosecutors Office, for investigation for organised crime and paramilitarism.  It has also committed to incorporating, as necessary, FARC ex-combatants into the government&rsquo;s National Protection Unit for the protection of members of social and political movements.  The effective implementation of these measures and of the other provisions of the agreement will be critical to its success. </p>  <p>  Ireland attaches the greatest importance to the protection and promotion of human and civil rights in Colombia and globally.  For many years Ireland has supported civil society groups and international agencies working to ensure the protection and promotion of human rights in Colombia and officials from our Embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia, regularly meet human rights groups from that country.  In addition I recently sent a group of senior Irish officials to Colombia, who met United Nations and civil society representatives, including from groups involved in the promotion and defence of human rights.  Subsequently, officials from my Department met Colombian human rights defenders visiting Ireland with Peace Brigades International.  These discussions focused on the legacy of the conflict and the implications of the ongoing peace process.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also been a long-time supporter of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Christian Aid and other organisations working in the area of human rights in Colombia.  We have provided more than &euro;400,000 in funding for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia since 2014.  At the Human Rights Council in Geneva in March of this year, Ireland commended the work of the OHCHR in Colombia and called for the renewal of its mandate beyond 31 October 2016.  As emphasised in our national statement, human rights must be central to the peace agreement.  This is something we have consistently advocated and will continue to advocate. </p>  <p>  Ireland also engages with Colombia on human rights in the EU context, including through the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue.  Ireland is an active contributor in this process which addresses the subject directly with the Colombian government at official level.  Through this mechanism, the Union engages in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including human rights defenders, trades unionists, prisoners, land restitution and environmental issues.  </p>  <p>  The promotion and protection of human rights is and will continue to be a central element of our engagement with Colombia - including during the implementation of the peace agreement.</p></reply>

I have previously expressed my strong concerns that the UN Security Council has failed to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court and the lack of measures adopted to constrain the actions by the parties, especially the Assad regime, in their attacks on civilians.</p>  <p>  I also accept that the distribution of humanitarian assistance by the UN has been hampered by the Assad regime, and this has also been repeatedly criticized by Ireland.  I repeat these condemnations, and call for an end to all sieges and denials of humanitarian access.  I believe that the UN faces an extremely challenging task because of the actions of the parties, especially the Assad regime, whose violations of international humanitarian law is unacceptable and must be held to account.</p>  <p>  I do not support the call for ending all humanitarian assistance if such denials of access continue.  Large sections of the population in regime held areas of Syria are also in grave need of humanitarian assistance and I do not believe that it would be acceptable to punish innocent civilians in regime held areas for the crimes of the regime. </p>  <p>  However, I have also repeatedly made clear my support for the UN in its efforts to work for a political resolution.  The fault for the failure of peace in Syria is not the UN&rsquo;s, but lies with those who have consistently sought to use violence and are seeking to continue the conflict. </p>  <p>  The situation in the occupied Palestinian territory remains a challenge for the entire international community &ndash; one on which Ireland is actively engaged &ndash; is not analogous to the situation in Syria.  </p>  <p>  The capacity of the UN to act to successfully address conflicts is dependent on the actions and policies of its Member States and the parties to conflicts. </p></reply>

The updated Plan has shifted its focus from working with people on the move to targeting a more static refugee and migrant population in Greece and to providing protection to those in Western Balkan countries.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the challenge of meeting the needs of refugees and migrants in Greece is a major one, and UNHCR recognises that many needs remain unmet.  Living conditions in several sites across Greece are unacceptable and have indeed deteriorated due to congestion, and it is clear that additional resources are required.  Ireland has provided &euro;7 million in core funding to UNHCR this year, an increase of over 20% on our core contribution in 2015.</p>  <p>  From our ongoing engagement with UNHCR, it is clear that it has in the past faced similar challenges to those in Greece currently, and that it believes it has the expertise, experience and mandate to address them.  There are no indications that coordination is a particular issue at this time and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is limiting its role to monitoring the situation.</p>  <p>  Regarding support to the Greek authorities in dealing with the situation, the European Commission has already released &euro;83 million in emergency support to Greece so far this year, out of a total of &euro;300 million budgeted for 2016.  There is no doubt that the health service and the Greek economy in general are under enormous pressure but the funding difficulties faced by the health service, and the consequent deterioration in health outcomes, predate the current migration crisis.  The Greek authorities, the Greek Red Cross and NGOs are working to provide primary health services to all the migrant centres across Greece and hospital access is available to those with more acute needs.</p></reply>

Work is underway to ensure that capabilities and resources are put in place to manage the complex process of a UK exit from the EU.</p>  <p>  I am happy to set out the resources which are in place in my Department as of today.  Within my Department, lead responsibility for the UK-EU relationship lies with Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division, within which there is a dedicated British-Irish Relations Unit currently staffed by five officers.  This Unit works very closely with colleagues in the wider IUKA Division, especially those colleagues focused on Northern Ireland.  Supporting and sustaining peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland is a key priority for my Department and protecting the interests of Northern Ireland will be a crucial element of our approach to any negotiations regarding the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.  </p>  <p>  The Department also has a Policy Planning Unit which was established in 2014 and has provided policy analysis to the IUKA Division.  In addition, there is also an intra-Departmental contact group on the UK-EU relationship, comprising senior officials across all of the Department&rsquo;s divisions and units. </p>  <p>  In terms of Irish offices abroad focused on the UK-EU relationship, I would list in particular the Embassy of Ireland in London, the Consulate General of Ireland in Edinburgh, our offices in Belfast and Armagh, and the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels.  Missions across the EU and further afield are all working on this issue, especially as the expected UK exit process approaches. </p>  <p>  I would also add that seven diplomatic officers of the Department are seconded to the European Union Division in the Department of the Taoiseach, while two diplomatic officers are seconded to the International and EU Relations Division of the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

It does this primarily through the UN Security Council which has, under the UN Charter, &lsquo;primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security&rsquo;.  The Council has a variety of tools at its disposal to address threats to international peace and to contribute towards the settlement of disputes and conflicts: it has the power to authorise military action, deploy peacekeeping and political missions, and to impose sanctions against non-compliant States.</p>  <p>  However, although the UN undoubtedly has a central role to play in addressing conflict, ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa serve to underscore the need for the UN to be much more effective.  Ireland, both directly and in co-operation with our partners in the European Union, continues to support efforts to reform the UN&rsquo;s structures and systems.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the UN Secretary General initiated three major review exercises which were aimed at improving the overall effectiveness of the UN&rsquo;s response to conflict.  The findings from the high level policy reviews on (1) UN Peace Operations, (2) Peacebuilding Architecture and (3) Women, Peace and Security were published and are in the process of being implemented.  Each of the reviews offered recommendations on how the UN can improve and reform its functions and structures particularly in relation to the global challenge presented by conflict and war.  Ireland engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also called for reform of the UN Security Council and has consistently stated that the Council needs to become more representative, more transparent and more efficient.  Ireland has called for an expansion of Security Council membership to that end and for restraint in the use of the veto by the five permanent members.  Ireland is a member of ACT, the &lsquo;Accountability, Coherence and Transparency&rsquo; group in the UN, that launched a Code of Conduct in 2015 calling on all member states, including permanent members, to support timely and decisive action by the Security Council aimed at preventing or ending genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. </p>  <p>  Regarding the situation of refugees in particular, Ireland has been tasked with co-facilitating the negotiations at the United Nations leading up to the Summit on large movements of refugees and migrants which will take place at the UN in New York on 19 September.  The fact that this Summit has been convened is a clear sign that the UN recognises the scale of the challenges posed by large-scale refugee movements and the need to build international solidarity and momentum to address these challenges.  It is hoped that leaders will be able to agree on a new set of global policy principles &ndash; the first of their kind &ndash; on refugees and migration.  Inter-governmental consultations on the Summit outcome are already underway and will continue through the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland will continue to advocate, through a range of available fora, for reform of the UN&rsquo;s structures and systems to ensure that it is equipped to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century and fulfil its critical role in the maintenance of international peace and security.</p></reply>

Over 65 million people are now displaced from their homes across the world, most of them living in situations of conflict.  Ireland's total humanitarian assistance amounted to some &euro;140 million in 2015 and is likely to increase this year.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response focuses on the most severe crises, often protracted over many years, including those which do not receive attention in the media.  The core objective of our assistance is  to save and protect lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity, before, during and in the aftermath of such crises.  Our assistance is focused on where needs are greatest, providing support to the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations.</p>  <p>  Access to communities to deliver humanitarian assistance in situations of conflict is often very difficult.  Irish Aid works through a range of partners, including NGOs, UN organisations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  They have the experience and capacity to deliver assistance and are best placed to respond in any given situation.  </p>  <p>  Over the last five years, we have provided humanitarian assistance to crises in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and across the Sahel.  We have also responded to a number of sudden onset emergencies, including the earthquake in Nepal last year and Typhoon Hayian in the Philippines in 2013.  </p>  <p>  In this period, Ireland&rsquo;s largest humanitarian response has been to the Syria crisis, with over &euro;46 million provided to our partners&rsquo; operations both within Syria and in the region since 2012.  We have also provided over &euro;80 million for victims of crises across the Horn of Africa since 2013, including over &euro;26 million for the South Sudan crisis alone.  In addition, Ireland has provided support in major crises situations in Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Somalia and Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  Over the last five years, we have supported programmes which are saving lives and reaching people fleeing from conflict, violence, drought, floods and famine, meeting their basic needs, enhancing their protection, improving their access to healthcare and clean water, providing food assistance and tackling malnutrition, and supporting them to find livelihood opportunities in the communities and countries where they are currently hosted. </p>  <p>  We continue to monitor each major crisis situation to ensure that our assistance is reaching those most in need.</p></reply>

The European Commission continues to work actively to support prospective member states in implementing reforms in order to make progress on their respective EU paths, and to assist in implementing the recommendations of the most recent  &lsquo;Enlargement Package&rsquo; published on 10 November 2015, and agreed at the General Affairs Council in December.</p>  <p>  In general, there has been steady progress in the accession process for states in the Western Balkans: the first two accession chapters have been opened in relation to Serbia and twenty-four chapters are now open in relation to Montenegro &ndash; the most recent of these, on Fisheries and Food Safety, opened on 30 June.  </p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the application for membership which Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted in February and also the coming into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Kosovo on 1 April. </p>  <p>  Progress in relation to the Republic of Macedonia and Albania has been more limited.  While progress continues to be made, difficulties in the rule of law, restrictions on freedom of expression and  corruption remain.

Such attacks are crimes and those responsible, in particular the Assad regime and Daesh, must be held accountable for their actions. </p>  <p>  Ireland, in conjunction with all our EU partners and 29 other States, sponsored a resolution calling for the Security Council of the United Nations to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court in 2014, a resolution which was vetoed by two permanent members of the Security Council.  </p>  <p>  The only means of securing the protection Syrian civilians from the Assad regime, as well as Daesh and Al-Qaeda, is through the promotion of a sustainable political solution to the Syrian conflict which has destabilised the region and whose brutality and promotion of sectarian violence been the key factor in the promotion of radical and extremist ideologies. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been a key supporter of the UN&rsquo;s efforts to achieve an end to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.  I call on all parties to support the UN&rsquo;s efforts and to commit themselves to work sincerely and with urgency for a nationwide ceasefire and a negotiated peace agreement which will protect the rights of the Syrian people and preserve the pluralistic character, unity and sovereignty of a free Syria at peace.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to the victims of the Syrian crisis will reach &euro;62M by the end of 2016.  This is Irish Aid&rsquo;s largest response to a single crisis in recent years.  Ireland&rsquo;s funding to the Syria crisis is channelled via the UN, Red Cross and NGOs, and is spent on priority needs which include food aid, water and sanitation, shelter, education and protection (including child protection and prevention of gender-based violence).</p>  <p>  This funding underlines Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to responding to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and in neighbouring countries for millions of the most vulnerable Syrians, including refugees, internally displaced persons and their host communities.</p></reply>

Migration continues to be discussed at the European Council, the Foreign Affairs Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council, as leaders seek to urgently address both the root causes of the crisis, and its terrible humanitarian consequences.</p>  <p>  Since the crisis emerged in the spring of last year, the EU has developed a range of measures to address it, including a programme to relocate asylum seekers from Greece and Italy to member States; an EU-Africa Trust Fund to address migration from Africa; an extensive package of measures with Turkey including the Turkey Refugee Facility; EUNAVFOR MED/Operation Sophia, the naval mission to prevent loss of life at sea by disrupting the business model of people smugglers and traffickers; and high-level dialogues with countries of origin and transit.</p>  <p>  The agreement that EU HOSG reached with Turkey in March has led to a very significant decrease in the number of migrants risking their lives crossing the Aegean. </p>  <p>  At the UN too, the migration crisis is being addressed at the highest level.  Ireland will co-facilitate a UN summit of world leaders on migration and refugees in New York on 19 September.

Significant resources continue to be deployed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Cairo and in Dublin, in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to both this citizen and his family.</p>  <p>  All actions taken in this case are considered in light of the Government&rsquo;s clear objectives.  First, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, second, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by the Taoiseach, Ministers and by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to date in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests.</p>  <p>  In addition to engagement with the Egyptian authorities, the Government also frequently engages with other states who have had citizens in similar situations, with our European and international partners represented in Egypt, and with the European Union.  I have engaged extensively with High Representative Ms Federica Mogherini, who has raised this case with Foreign Minister Shoukry.  The Taoiseach has also discussed this citizen&rsquo;s detention at the highest level with President el-Sisi, and those lines of communication remain open.  The Egyptian Government is in no doubt about the Irish Government&rsquo;s position and our desire to see our citizen released as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, any decision to release this citizen will be made solely by the Egyptian authorities.  Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any detention abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release. </p>  <p>  Following the latest, and very disappointing, delay in this trial, and in consultation with the family and their legal representatives, the Irish Government intends to lend its full support to a further request for release under the Presidential decree/Law 140, and will continue to work in support of these efforts.  It is important to note that we supported a previous application pursuant to Law 140; regrettably on the previous occasion, the application was not successful. </p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in Cairo, remain in ongoing contact with the citizen&rsquo;s family.  They will continue to engage appropriately with the Egyptian authorities, will remain resolute in seeking to protect the interests of this Irish citizen, and will do all possible to achieve a positive outcome.  They also liaise closely with his Egyptian legal team and have attended all trial hearings to date.  The Department also undertakes regular consular visits to him in prison. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I stand ready to make further contact with our Egyptian counterparts at the appropriate time and we have both been in contact with our counterparts in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The Government will remain resolute in pursuing its clear objectives in this case and in what we firmly believe to be in this citizen&rsquo;s best interests and to be most likely to contribute to a positive outcome for him.</p></reply>

My Department has its own detailed contingency framework and has commenced implementation, while the state agencies promoting Ireland&rsquo;s trade interests have also published their strategies for safeguarding and promoting Ireland&rsquo;s trading position.  Most of the information relating to this work can be found on a dedicated EU-UK page on the government website merrionstreet.ie.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I will ensure that we have the capabilities in place to manage all this work both at home and abroad.  Within my Department, our Ambassadors and Consuls General across the world have been extensively briefed, both in the days leading up to the referendum and in light of the outcome.  Our Embassies will support and co-ordinate work on the ground with Local Market Teams involving the State agencies, while that work will be guided at home by the work of the Trade Division within my Department and by the Export Trade Council, which I chair.  </p>  <p>  Following the launch of the Government&rsquo;s Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, a list of 27 priority markets were identified, with Local Market Teams were established in each of these, chaired by the local Ambassador and consisting of representatives of the Embassy and relevant state agencies.  These market teams submit annual market plans as well as six-monthly reports of activity, which are reviewed by the Export Trade Council. </p>  <p>  While the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports go to Europe and the US and we must continue to cultivate these markets, the Government is strongly focused on the further development of trading partnerships with other important emerging markets.  Market diversification is crucial for Ireland&rsquo;s long term economic sustainability.  In 2014, seven additional high potential and exploratory markets were identified to increase our engagement with high growth markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa. </p>  <p>  Building on this review, new Embassies have been opened in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Zagreb (Croatia), alongside the reopening of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy to the Holy See.  Consulates-General have also been opened in Hong Kong (China), Austin (Texas, USA) and in Sao Paulo (Brazil).  The opening of these new Embassies and Consulates is strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to take advantage of emerging opportunities in these important markets, and complements the existing trade promotion work of our Embassy network. </p>  <p>  Overall, the Embassy network plays a crucial role in proactively addressing market access issues, supporting Irish businesses seeking to grow overseas; holding promotional events for, and in association with, State agencies and actively contributing to the organisation and conduct of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led Trade Missions.</p>  <p>  A next step is to equip the Embassy network with the resources to remain proactive and to open more business opportunities for exporters.  Our ambitions to transform how our mission network supports Irish business overseas has even greater relevance in the face of the challenges posed by the UK Referendum.</p>  <p>  The Economic Diplomacy Strategy, which I launched in January this year, seeks to build on the consolidation of the Department&rsquo;s trade role in recent years, with a view to providing a new direction for the Department&rsquo;s trade activities so as to equip our Mission network with the resources and autonomy to become active and open business hubs for our exporters, thereby strengthening the work of the State agencies and their networks of representation overseas.  Within the context of the very successful Local Market Teams, the initiative is intended to augment the already important work the Department, Embassy network and Agency presence overseas undertakes on a daily basis to promote Irish business.</p>  <p>  As part of this new Strategy, the Department is establishing a network of locally-hired Commercial Attach&eacute;s to extend the range and impact of our embassies&rsquo; activities in support of trade.  The embassies in Mexico, Brasilia, Buenos Aires, Bucharest, and Jakarta, have all provided a firm and immediate basis for the appointment of a locally hired, term limited, Commercial Attach&eacute; and it is proposed to appoint such officers to these locations in the coming months.  In addition, provision is already made for the appointment of an Economic Development Officer (EDO) in Abuja, funded from the Irish Aid budget, whose role would be analogous to that of a Commercial Attach&eacute;.  There is potential to make similar appointments in other locations.</p></reply>

Discussion of the situation in Ukraine has featured on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council in January, March and April this year, either as a standalone item, or in broader discussions around the European Union&rsquo;s relationship with Russia and the Eastern Partnership.  Most recently at last week&rsquo;s European Council, EU leaders discussed the ongoing diplomatic efforts towards achieving full implementation of the Minsk agreements in the context of the renewal of EU sanctions against the Russian Federation.</p>  <p>  In March last year the European Council agreed that the duration of these sanctions should be directly linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements.  Despite limited progress in some areas, key elements of these agreements remain to be implemented.  Agreement on a number of issues, including the modalities for the holding of local elections in separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine, as called for in the Minsk &ldquo;Package of Measures,&rdquo; has yet to be achieved.</p>  <p>  As the Minsk agreements offer the only basis for a stable and lasting political resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, the EU will continue to support and facilitate their full implementation as a matter of urgency. </p></reply>

Ultimately, the outside General Government status is determined by EUROSTAT.  This outside General Government status is determined by a combination of the traditional autonomy that such institutions have historically enjoyed and their capacity to generate own income, so that they meet the 'market test' applied by EUROSTAT, that is, that Government funding represents less than 50% of their overall income.  As such, borrowings by Universities are 'off-balance sheet' and do not impact on, for example, the level of General Government Debt - a key measure of fiscal performance.</p>  <p>  These considerations do not apply in the case of the Institutes of Technology.  IOTs, unlike Universities, are currently classified as inside General Government.  Consequently, expenditure by the IOTs impacts on the General Government Balance (GGB) and borrowing by the IOTs contributes to the General Government Debt (GGD).  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the question of the borrowing capacity of IOTs is currently under examination by the Department of Education and Skills, in consultation with my Department in light of proposals for increased provision of student accommodation as part of the Government's response to the housing crisis.</p></reply>

As I had indicated in my previous response to the Deputy, the Memorandum of Understanding between Insurance Ireland and the OPW provides that OPW will provide detailed background and technical information on its completed flood defence schemes to Insurance Ireland (II), and II members have committed to take all this information into account when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.</p>  <p>  Flood mitigation works carried out by local authorities are not generally designed to protect against a 1% AEP flood event, the desired standard set out in the Memorandum of Understanding.  OPW generally would not have detailed technical and design information on projects carried out by the local authorities.  For these reasons, there are no plans to include local authority flood mitigation works in the scope of the Memorandum of Understanding.</p>  <p>  From the information now supplied, it is suggested that the works carried out by the Local Authority in this particular instance may provide the degree of flood protection generally required by the insurance industry.  While it is open to any person or group seeking property insurance to supply insurance companies and/or brokers with any relevant information on flood defences which might influence a decision on the provision of cover, I have asked my officials to liaise with Cork County Council to explore the possibility of providing the relevant information, in the agreed format, to the Insurance Ireland in relation to this scheme.</p></reply>

It should be noted, however, that the focus of this scheme will be primarily be on arts and cultural centres, rather than local heritage centres.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s scheme will target investment at a range of different facilities and will be broken down into three streams as follows:-</p>  <p>- The refurbishment and enhancement of existing purpose-built arts and cultural facilities, with maximum grants of &euro;300,000.  Eligible facilities would include arts centres, theatres, galleries, museums, artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces (Stream 1).</p>  <p>- Significant improvements to a smaller number of key facilities.

Four schemes operated by my Department could potentially be of benefit - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme, the Structures at Risk Fund, the Town and Village Regeneration Scheme, and the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme.</p>  <p>  I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support in excess of 330 projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is now fully allocated.</p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, which has an allocation of over &euro;900,000 and will support 57 projects nationally in 2016, is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Funding for 2016 has now been fully allocated.</p>  <p>  No decision has been made on the allocation of funding to these schemes for 2017, which will be subject to the normal budgetary processes.  The Conservation or Heritage Officer in the relevant local authority will be able to advise regarding funding available for conservation works to structures on the Record of Protected Structures and it is advisable for interested parties to remain in contact with their local authority on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  The Council recently awarded funding of over &euro;880,000 to 171 heritage projects nationwide under its 2016 Heritage Management Grant Scheme.  Further details of grant schemes available from the Heritage Council can be found at www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p>  <p>  My Department is also charged with the delivery of a Town and Village Regeneration scheme, with a commitment to provide &euro;30 million over a six-year period.  I hope to be in a position to announce the call for proposals for the 2016 scheme shortly.  The central aim of the scheme is to support the revitalisation of towns and villages in order to improve the living and working environment of their communities and increase their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.  The type of projects to be funded under this initiative is primarily a matter for the local authorities to identify in partnership with their communities.  However, the overall intention of the funding would be to focus on public spaces, thereby increasing the attractiveness of the town or village as a local commercial and social centre and, as a result, increasing its sustainability as a place in which to live and work.  Proposed initiatives could also look at ways to enhance its environment and amenity in the interests of residents, businesses, visitors and the promotion of tourism; and also as a centre for culture and local heritage, thereby enhancing the sense of identity - physically and socially.  In this context, it may be possible for the committee referred to by the Deputy to access funding under this scheme.  I would suggest the community group get in touch with their local authority as they will be made aware when the scheme is launched.</p>  <p>  It may be also possible to access funding from the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme and I would urge the group to get in contact with the Local Action Group in their area.  LEADER aims to support the sustainable development of rural communities using a community-led local development approach to the delivery of funding.  All decisions on project funding are made at a local level, based on the aims and objectives set out in a local development strategy.  I expect to be signing a contract later this week with the relevant LCDC for the delivery of LEADER in the county in question.</p></reply>

Under the programme, funding will be distributed by Local Action Groups to rural communities in line with the local development strategies that have been developed within each sub-regional area in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In determining the county allocations for the 2014-2020 LEADER programme, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM).  Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable level of funding.  However, county Cork was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county.</p>  <p>  The methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage.  Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the LEADER elements of the RDP 2014-2020.  Under these criteria, county Cork was awarded funding of some &euro;13.9 million.</p>  <p>  The allocation of additional funding to LEADER groups throughout Ireland, which is referred to in the new Programme for Government, will be considered in due course.</p></reply>

In the case of the Historic City of Dublin proposal, this is being advanced by Dublin City Council and my Department is represented on the Steering Committee.</p>  <p>  The next steps will involve developing Management Plans for each site (a UNESCO requirement) and the designation of core and buffer zones in each case.  At each stage local consultation is required.  This process will also have to take into account the fact that some sites will be managed by the Office of Public Works, others by local authorities and that two monuments on the Royal Sites list are privately owned.  Another - Eamhain Macha in Armagh - is in Northern Ireland.  The culmination of these steps will be the creation of the full nomination documents for each site for submission to UNESCO.</p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can but the process is a lengthy one and all of the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at each and every stage.  While this adds to the timescale, it is infinitely preferable than a top down approach that fails to engage with local communities.  It also ensures a far better chance of best care and support for the protection and preservation of these sites into the future.</p></reply>

As I mentioned in that answer, by way of supporting the maintenance and development of the Irish language as a community and household language in the Gaeltacht, the implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 </i>is recognised as a key priority in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>.  Other measures outlined in the Programme include:</p><p>- A focus on job creation in the Gaeltacht, through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta;</p><p>- Encouraging the attendance by children in Irish-medium pre-schools or na&iacute;onra&iacute; in Gaeltacht areas;</p><p>- Recognising the importance of the status of Irish as a full working language of the EU institutions and working towards ending the derogation, as circumstances allow; and</p><p>- Increasing the investment in the Irish language.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department, together with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, administers a wide range of schemes, programmes and initiatives targeting language and economic development in Gaeltacht areas.  Further details are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.ahg.gov.ie and on the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta website at www.udaras.ie.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that in order to further underpin the implementation of the Strategy and the language planning process, as set out in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, a specific allocation of &euro;1 m has also been provided in the current year.  This allocation will further enable my Department, acting in concert with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and relevant stakeholders at community level, to implement a range of specific and practical measures aimed at both supporting the implementation of the Strategy, as well as the language planning process in Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>In relation to the economic development of the Gaeltacht, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas.  In that context, I wish to acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht.  In its regional enterprise role in the Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, will continue to work towards attracting investment to the Gaeltacht, in addition to supporting micro-enterprises and developing the skills base in the Gaeltacht.  In order to enable &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to fulfil its job creation and job retention role in the Gaeltacht, capital funding of &euro;6.687 m has been provided by the Exchequer to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 2016, in addition to its own resources from the sale of assets and investments.</p><p>The issue of funding in respect of 2017 will be addressed in due course in the context of the estimates and budgetary processes.</p></reply>

It, in tandem with a number of local authorities and village communities, prepared a toolkit which was launched in October 2012 at the inaugural community-led VDS workshop.  The toolkit sets out a step-by-step guide to undertaking a community-led VDS in Ireland, using a collaborative and participative process, and has been developed in accordance with the UNECE Aarhus Convention and the European Landscape Convention (ELC).  The Heritage Council, in collaboration with a number of local authorities, has since been proactive in helping interested communities to develop VDS.  In many ways, the approach followed is similar to the Historic Towns Initiative (HTI) framework, also developed by my Department in collaboration with the Heritage Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and relevant local authorities, although it is focussed on smaller communities.</p>  <p>  Given the limited scope for funding, my preference is for the continued fostering of a community-led approach rather than the development of a nationwide plan, while considering the possibility of a prioritised targeted approach to towns and villages with a view to not only protecting their character and heritage, but also contributing to regional development through encouraging economic growth and employment.</p>  <p>  However, all approaches are still under consideration as I seek to further strengthen the protection of our built heritage, which I recognise cannot be achieved without the full engagement of the respective local authorities, local communities and interested organisations.</p></reply>

Under its provisions, persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state, are entitled to receive health care services in Ireland at the cost of that member state provided they are not subject to Irish social security legislation.  Persons in this category are entitled to full eligibility and receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement.</p>  <p>  The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card is given the opportunity to avail of his or her entitlement.  In assessing an application under the EU Regulations the HSE will establish if the person is subject to Irish social security legislation.  A person is considered subject to Irish social security legislation if s/he is in receipt of a contributory Irish social welfare payment or engaged in work in Ireland and subject to PRSI.  If so, the person will not qualify for a medical card under EU legislation, but may qualify for a means-tested medical card under national legislation.</p>  <p>  The result of the recent EU Referendum in the UK means that the UK electorate have declared their wish to leave the EU.  It is important to be clear that the UK has not yet left the EU.  Until it formally withdraws from the Union, it remains a full Member, with all of its existing rights and obligations.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that there will be no immediate changes in the area of health as a consequence of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  Health cooperation between the UK and Ireland will not be affected in the immediate term.  Arrangements are in place, building on an already completed initial risk assessment plan, to consider any longer-term implications of the referendum result. </p></reply>

In line with the National Drugs Strategy, the Health Service Executive has reoriented the addiction services in recent years so that they are capable of dealing with all substances.  The HSE is continuing to develop the spread and range of addiction services to achieve better coverage across the country, especially in areas most affected by the drug problem.  Treatment is provided through a network of statutory and non-statutory agencies, using a four tier model of service delivery.  The four tier model is based on the principle that drug treatment is best provided at the lowest level of complexity, matching the patient&rsquo;s needs and as close to the patient&rsquo;s home as possible. </p>  <p>  The National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee (NDRIC) is chaired by the HSE and meets on a monthly basis.  The primary objective of NDRIC is to oversee and monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation (2007).  The Committee has developed a National Drugs Rehabilitation Framework which is crucial to achieving a more integrated treatment and rehabilitation service.  The aim of the framework is to provide a 'continuum of care' for the recovering drug user through promoting a more integrated and person-centred approach to rehabilitation based on shared care planning.  I am advised that the implementation of the National Drugs Rehabilitation Framework is a priority for the HSE and is currently being rolled out on a national basis.</p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE is continuing to progress the development of a clinical and organisational governance framework, which provides for a governance structure setting out clear lines of authority, accountability and responsibility at all levels.  The HSE National Addiction Governance Group are in the process of finalising a report on the matter, which will contribute to the achievement of this objective.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  In 2009, NIAC recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls, and in September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of second level schools.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults. It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school and over 200,000 girls have received the vaccine since its introduction. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  The HPRA's role  is to monitor adverse reactions to medicinal products including vaccinations.</p>  <p>  In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states. </p>  <p>  However, I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of symptoms experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition.  I want to reassure these girls and their families that they are eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The HSE will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services according to the individual needs of these young women.</p></reply>

A prescriber may, on occasion, request that patients are only supplied with one week's supply of medicine at a time, due to the nature of the medicines involved and/or any ongoing safety concerns for the patient.  In such circumstances, the prescription would be required to be dispensed by the pharmacy on a weekly basis, and this would be governed by the particular patient's care needs.  This is known as phased dispensing.  The rules in relation to dispensing have not changed. </p><p>I have been informed by the HSE that its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) issued a letter to all pharmacies on the 5th of May to reconfirm the rules applying to phased dispensing. </p><p>Claims by pharmacists for phased dispensing fees are only valid in certain narrow circumstances, where the dispensing on multiple supply occasions is:</p><p>- at the request of a patient's physician;</p><p>- due to the inherent nature of the medicine in terms of product stability and shelf life;</p><p>- where a patient is commencing new drug therapy with a view to establishing patient tolerance and acceptability before continuing on a full treatment regimen;</p><p>- in exceptional circumstances where the patient is incapable of safely and effectively managing the medication regimen.</p><p>The HSE/PCRS recently noted a significant increase in the number of pharmacy claims requesting phased dispensing fees, and is currently carrying out an audit of all claims submitted for such fees.  The HSE has already written to a number of pharmacies in relation to phased dispensing claims, and will engage further with these pharmacies to address any outstanding issues.  </p><p>The HSE has recently increased its capacity to undertake an enhanced level of inspections in pharmacies to give assurance to the system regarding probity issues.</p></reply>

Both hospitals are designated cancer centres and have an extensive range of multi-disciplinary services and expert clinical advice available to them.  A National Clinical Lead in Soft Tissue Sarcomas is in place to oversee the services for patients with sarcomas.  Irish patients with sarcoma have their cases presented and discussed at one of the two sarcoma multi-disciplinary teams.  Members of these teams also have links with European specialists in sarcoma. </p>  <p>  St. Vincent's University Hospital has provided highly specialised and individualised treatment to sarcoma sufferers for a number of years.  St. Vincent's has access to all of the relevant specialties including surgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology and pathology and is the largest provider of surgical procedures for soft tissue sarcomas in the country. </p>  <p>  It is intended to increase, in line with available resources, the number of consultant medical oncologists working in the eight designated cancer centres to meet demand.  My Department has agreed that the recruitment of a consultant medical oncologist with a special interest in sarcoma, based in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, will be prioritised to facilitate further development of the service there.  The Director General of the HSE has directed that work on the open recruitment process is to begin immediately. </p></reply>

It is important to be clear that the UK has not yet left the EU.  Until it formally withdraws from the Union, the UK remains a full Member, with all of its existing rights and obligations.</p><p>  People can be assured that there will be no immediate changes in the area of health as a consequence of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  Cross-border services and health cooperation with Northern Ireland will not be affected in the immediate term by the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  </p><p>The terms of a British exit from the EU are unknown at this stage.  It is expected to take a minimum of two years of negotiations between all EU member states, including Ireland, to agree a new arrangement between the UK and the EU, and the Department of Health will be fully involved in these negotiations.</p><p>Ensuring that there is minimum disruption in the area of health and that essential services are maintained will be our key priority. </p><p>The North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Plenary took place on Monday 4 July.  This provided an important opportunity for an initial strategic discussion between the Government and the NI Executive on the impact of the recent UK referendum.</p><p>In order to optimise joint planning and engagement on key issues arising following the UK referendum result, the NSMC agreed to work together to ensure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected and advanced and the benefits of North/South co-operation are fully recognised in any new arrangements which emerge as regards the United Kingdom&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.</p><p>NSMC ministerial sectoral meetings will provide an important forum for consideration of the strategic and cross-cutting issues arising from the UK referendum.  The next NSMC Health and Food Safety ministerial sectoral meeting is scheduled to take place in autumn 2016. </p><p>In advance of this, my Department will build on initial work completed to undertake a full audit of the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising over the longer term, in the phases preceding and following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p><p>This work will be conducted by a sub-committee of the Management Board, which was set up in advance of the UK referendum to examine the potential consequences of a UK decision to leave the EU on healthcare in Ireland and for Irish citizens. </p><p>Regular contact with counterparts at political and official level will be maintained throughout this process.</p><p>Further discussion on the implications of the referendum result will take place at the next NSMC Plenary, which takes place in Armagh in November.</p></reply>

To ensure these needs are met in 2016, &euro;7.25 million was allocated by the HSE, at the beginning of the year, to provide appropriate services and supports to approximately 1,500 young people with disabilities and autism who will require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative (life skills) training this year.  In addition, a proportion of the additional &euro;3 million secured for disability services in June will also fund new initiatives to meet the needs of this year's school leavers. </p></reply>

Awareness of the provisions of the Cross-Border Directive has grown substantially recently, reflected in the activity in the NCP and the HSE has been asked to provide data to the Deputy directly. </p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the EU Directive on Patients&rsquo; Rights in Cross Border Healthcare in Ireland.  In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  - and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p><p>The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. </p><p>Similar to other healthcare schemes operated by EU Member States under Community legislation, access to healthcare abroad  under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways, hence the HSE has in particular concentrated on informing the doctors who make the referrals.  </p></reply>

The Directive establishes a framework for cross border healthcare between EU/EEA states to facilitate patients to access care in another Member State in accordance with their entitlements in their own country.  Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  As such, it allows Irish residents to avail of healthcare in other EU or EEA (excluding Switzerland) Member States that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation.</p>  <p>  The result of the recent EU Referendum in the UK means that the UK electorate have declared their wish to leave the EU.  It is important to be clear that the UK has not yet left the EU.  Until it formally withdraws from the Union, it remains a full Member, with all of its existing rights and obligations.  I wish to assure the Deputy that there will be no immediate changes in the area of health as a consequence of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  Irish patients who had planned to travel to the UK under the CBD in the near future may continue to do as planned.</p>  <p>  The terms of a British exit from the EU are unknown at this stage.  It is expected to take a minimum of two years of negotiations between all EU member states, including Ireland, to agree a new arrangement between the UK and the EU, and the Department of Health will be fully involved in these negotiations.</p>  <p>  The North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Plenary took place on Monday 4 July.  This provided an important opportunity for an initial strategic discussion between the Government and the NI Executive on the impact of the recent UK referendum.</p>  <p>  In order to optimise joint planning and engagement on key issues arising following the UK referendum result, the NSMC agreed to work together to ensure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected and advanced and the benefits of North/South co-operation are fully recognised in any new arrangements which emerge as regards the United Kingdom&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.</p>  <p>  NSMC ministerial sectoral meetings will provide an important forum for consideration of the strategic and cross-cutting issues arising from the UK referendum.  The next NSMC Health and Food Safety ministerial sectoral meeting is scheduled to take place in autumn 2016. </p>  <p>  In advance of this, my Department will build on initial work completed to undertake a full audit of the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising over the longer term, in the phases preceding and following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p>  <p>  This work will be conducted by a sub-committee of the Management Board, which was set up in advance of the UK referendum to examine the potential consequences of a UK decision to leave the EU on healthcare in Ireland and for Irish citizens. </p>  <p>  Regular contact with counterparts at political and official level will be maintained throughout this process.</p>  <p>  Further discussion on the implications of the referendum result will take place at the next NSMC Plenary, which takes place in Armagh in November.</p></reply>

It is transmitted by mosquitoes.  Infection with Zika virus in pregnant women has been linked with a serious birth condition called microcephaly where babies are born with unusually small heads.  Cases of a neurological illness (called Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome) possibly caused by Zika virus infection are also being investigated.</p><p>Environmental conditions in Ireland do not support the natural reservoirs or vectors of the Zika virus.  Consequently, the risk of onward transmission in Ireland is considered low.</p><p>Based on national and international expert medical guidance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strongly recommends that pregnant women consider postponing their travel to affected areas, and in particular to areas classified as having an increasing or widespread transmission of the Zika virus.  This is consistent with advice from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p><p>The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure appropriate and up to date advices are available to Irish travellers to affected countries.  There is also ongoing liaison between the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the Olympic Council of Ireland concerning preparations for the Games in Rio later this year. </p><p>There are a number of preventative measures citizens can take to reduce their exposure to mosquito bites.  These include:</p><p>- using of mosquito repellents;</p><p>- wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers, especially during the hours of highest mosquito activity; and</p><p>- using of mosquito nets in accommodation which is not adequately screened or air-conditioned.</p><p>Travel advices for Irish citizens travelling to Brazil are available on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website (<i>www.dfa.ie</i>).  Further practical information is available on the websites of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (<i>www.hpsc.ie</i>) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

However, section 47(7) the Public Health Tobacco Act 2002 as substituted by Section 16 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2004 provides an exemption from the general prohibition on smoking in a workplace in respect of certain places.  The exemption applies to "an outdoor part of a place or premises covered by a fixed or movable roof, provided that not more than 50 per cent of the perimeter of that part is surrounded by one or more walls or similar structures (inclusive of windows, doors, gates or other means of access to or egress from that part)".</p>  <p>  Exposure to second-hand smoke in confined spaces is a serious health hazard and even brief exposure can cause damage.  Second-hand smoke consists of over 7,000 chemicals, including more than 60 known carcinogens.  Medical and scientific evidence shows that exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of serious medical conditions, such as lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and sudden infant death syndrome. </p>  <p>  Given that the Government's policy is to achieve a tobacco free Ireland by 2025, there are no plans to amend the current legislation.</p></reply>

Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate setting.</p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The Department of Health has no role in such negotiations.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.</p>  <p>  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p>  <p>  - Price(s) previously charged,</p>  <p>  - Local market price, and</p>  <p>  - Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers,</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible, and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and has commenced its work in this area.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why the costs of public facilities are generally higher than those in the private sector.  More complex and highly dependent residents are more generally catered for by the public system which has obvious cost implications.  In addition, conditions of employment and tenure differ between private and public residential care facilities.</p>  <p>  However, it is important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible, and towards that end the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities, and the Department of Health will work closely with the HSE in that context to ensure that value for money is delivered.</p></reply>

I do accept that many residents with higher or more complex care needs are often catered for by the public system which has obvious cost implications.  From an acute hospital discharge perspective the challenge to find suitable placements for those with more complex needs is often resolved in public centres where nurse staffing levels in particular can cater for their needs.  </p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which was published last year reported that HSE long-term residential care facilities have the highest proportion of maximum dependent older people at just over 60% compared to that of private nursing homes with almost 35%.  The most expensive of the HSE's public nursing homes generally accommodate a cohort of young chronic sick clients.  These patients are complex cases with high dependency requiring significant nursing care.  There are also nursing homes that specialise in the care of residents with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and who need a secure environment and others who care for residents with challenging behaviours. </p>  <p>  However, there are other reasons why costs are higher in the public system.  Conditions of employment and tenure for staff are also different and the capacity of a public facility to adjust its costs in response to changed circumstances is very different.  However, the NHSS Review acknowledged that even allowing for the fact that residents in public facilities may have higher care needs, costs for public facilities appear to be in excess of what applies in private facilities.</p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to ensuring that all services, including residential services, represent good value for the taxpayer.  My Department will be working closely with the HSE to examine the costs of public facilities and to address any elements that are unacceptable or inappropriate.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has responsibility for setting prices in private and voluntary facilities.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,</p>  <p>  - Price(s) previously charged,</p>  <p>  - Local market price, and</p>  <p>  - Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p>  <p>The Accounts of the Public Services 2010 report referred to by the Deputy notes that the HSE charged &euro;52 million to the long-term residential care subhead in respect of medicines and therapeutic services to residents.  Residents themselves were not charged for these services.  In 2012 the HSE took the steps necessary to correct the position.</p></reply>

I am informed by the HSE that a statement of concern regarding Orthodontic Services in the Dublin area during the period 1999 to 2000 is being examined by the HSE in accordance with normal look-back procedures.  This arises due to concerns expressed by a clinician in relation to the care provided.  The review is being overseen by a multi-disciplinary team and supported by external orthodontic expertise. The initial examination of 6,000 patient charts has been protracted due to the paper-based nature of the files and the passage of time, but is almost complete.  The initial indications are that alternative care arrangements, including private care arrangements, were provided by the Eastern Regional Health Authority.  However, as not all records are complete, the HSE plans to arrange physical dental examinations for 50 of the patients to ensure that all matters were followed up appropriately.  It is the HSE's intention to publish the report as soon as the examinations of this statement of concern are concluded.</p></reply>

Patients apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish-based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.

In the instance that a consultant wishes to refer a patient to a non-EU/EEA country e.g. the USA, the HSE TAS applies the TAS administrative process and documentation for the purposes of such applications.  Such applications for treatment in non-EU/EEA countries are required to provide evidence that treatment is not available within the EU/EEA.</p></reply>

This will ensure that the home support services provided in 2015 are maintained and that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months.  &euro;10m of this money has been ring fenced for home care as part of the new winter initiative.

All communications with Console continue to be conducted by the HSE according to proper audit processes, and having regard to appropriate legal procedures.  In addition, the Charities Regulatory Authority and the UK Charities Regulator are both engaging with Console arising from the findings of the HSE audit.  In addition, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also engaged with the Agency as a result of these findings.  Finally, two independent experts have been appointed by Console arising from the findings of the audit conveyed to the agency. </p><p>I am aware of the importance of the services provided by Console, and the importance of ensuring that these are not impacted by the on-going issues.  These services continue to be available, including the Freefone 24/7 Helpline.  The HSE is in contact with the two independent experts appointed by Console, and the Executive is also considering alternative arrangements for services provided by the agency, if this is deemed necessary.  Consideration by the HSE of alternative service options has been underway in parallel with the audit process.

The UK has not yet initiated the formal withdrawal process and may not do so for some time.  In consequence, it is very unclear what changes the UK may seek to negotiate in the realm of fisheries.</p>  <p>  Within my Department, I have ensured that my officials have been examining all potential implications across a range of very complex issues in fisheries.  Unlike other sectors, when it comes to fish stocks, we share and exploit many of the same resources as the UK and must manage those resources within a coastal states framework &ndash; whatever the formal relationship.  In addition, there are reciprocal access rights for Irish and Northern Irish vessels in each other's inshore waters that benefit both.</p>  <p>  Since 1983, the fish stocks in the waters around both Ireland and the UK have been managed within the EU under the Common Fisheries Policy.  That policy is a complicated construction and none of its interlinked elements can be considered separately, as different agreements have been made over many years of developing the policy.</p>  <p>  These and all of the other issues in fisheries and all of the other agrifood sectors are being carefully examined by my Department.  Specifically on fisheries, my Department has already held an information seminar with industry and other stakeholders.  In addition, later this week I am convening a meeting of key sectoral representatives across all agri-food sectors, including fisheries.  The purpose of this consultative committee will be to provide a consultative forum on issues arising from Brexit &ndash; many of which will be common to all sectors- as negotiations begin and develop.</p>  <p>  From an Irish perspective I will be doing my utmost to ensure that any settlement does not come at a cost to Irelands' fishing communities and that our interests are fully protected within the EU.  I hope that the EU and the UK act in concert as good neighbours to continue to protect the long term sustainability of our stocks, our fishing industries and the coastal communities dependant on them.</p></reply>

The number of BPS entitlements allocated was determined by the number of eligible hectares declared by a farmer in 2013 or 2015, whichever was the lesser, and the value of entitlements allocated was based on a fixed percentage of the value of Single Payment Scheme entitlements owned by the farmer in 2014 and any payment received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme.</p>  <p>  The person named declared 14.28 eligible hectares in 2013 and 16.39 eligible hectares in 2015.  He was therefore allocated 14.28 entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme on the basis of the 2013 versus 2015 rule.  The value of the payment received by the person named in 2015 shows a marginal reduction on the value of his payment in 2014.  This is consistent with the marginal reduction to all farmers&rsquo; payments in 2015 based on the reduced national ceiling allocated to Ireland under CAP 2015-2019.  The value of the entitlements held by the person named will increase under convergence each year from 2015-2019 as set out in the Definitive Statement of Entitlements issued to the person named in early June 2016.</p></reply>

Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012 prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August during the nesting and breeding season for birds and wildlife.  The Department of Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht inserts annual notices in the main newspapers outlining the restrictions on the destruction of hedges and vegetation on uncultivated land from 1 March to 31 August.  The most recent such notice issued on 1 March 2016.</p>  <p>  I am supportive of the provisions in the Heritage Bill 2016 which was drafted following a comprehensive review of Section 40.  The Bill included proposals for managed hedge cutting and burning at certain times within the existing closed period on a pilot two year basis.  This legislation is not yet in force as it has not been passed by the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, the current restrictions under Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts still apply.</p></reply>

A submission will soon be made to the European Commission in this regard.  Any such scheme must meet certain specific criteria laid down by Rural Development Regulation.  This scheme, in addition to the existing supports available to sheep farmers under the BPS, GLAS, ANC and TAMS, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As regards the specifics of the scheme design and operation, my Department has engaged in extensive consultation with farm organisations.  In addition they met last week with officials of the European Commission to discuss the proposed new scheme in the context of the specific requirements of the Rural Development Programme.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently working on the details of the scheme in light of both the consultation with the farming organisations as well as the discussions with the European Commission.  It is clear that any scheme must meet the exacting requirements of the Rural Development Regulations in terms of only compensating farmers for any actions undertaken on the basis of costs incurred or income foregone.  Furthermore, in any scheme where farmers must undertake actions, those actions must go beyond the normal standards of husbandry practice before they can be considered as an eligible cost incurred by a farmer.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing top ups to hill ewes as referred to by the Deputy could only be calculated when the number of hill ewes submitted as part of farmers&rsquo; applications would be known.  However I wish to stress that whilst any scheme must be acceptable to the European Commission in the context of the requirements of the Rural Development Programme I am also anxious that such a scheme takes into account the different production systems in the Irish sheep flock and recognises the different challenges facing both lowland flocks and hill flocks.  It is my intention that this scheme&rsquo;s design will maximise the number of participants and deliver tangible benefits to the sheep sector in terms of its impact to on- farm practices.</p></reply>

At a strategic level, Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 acknowledged that there is a rising global population together with the growing middle classes in a number of rapidly growing economies and changing dietary patterns to incorporate increased protein consumption.  Taken together these provide a great opportunity for increasing the exports of high quality, safe and sustainably produced Irish beef and dairy production.  The target in Food Wise 2025 is to increase the overall value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion by 2025.</p>  <p>  Although there is not a detailed breakdown available of the economic demographics of consumers of Irish beef and dairy, the Department continually monitors trade statistics produced by Bord Bia and the CSO, in order to analyse the destination of exports and, together with industry, to identify new opportunities.  I am very conscious of the importance of growing international markets as a valuable outlet for Irish beef and dairy production and very significant progress has been made in this context.  This has been recognised in Food Wise 2025.</p>  <p>  The main markets for Irish beef and dairy products are in developed countries and developing countries with high levels of GDP growth.  According to Bord Bia, in 2015 some 52% of Irish beef exports went to the UK, 36% to other EU markets and the balance to US, Middle East, Hong Kong and Switzerland with some beef, generally more affordable cuts and offals, being exported to developing markets.</p>  <p>  Dairy exports have in general a wider spread of exports with just under 60% of exports going to the UK and other EU markets, 19% to Asia, 4% to Africa and 8% both to North America and the Middle East according to Bord Bia.  Generally infant formula and powders are the product categories driving dairy exports in developing markets.  Dairy exports to China were almost 10 times higher in 2015 than 10 years ago and exports of dairy powders are growing to markets in West Africa with high levels of GDP growth.</p></reply>

One of my priorities is to support the provision of lower-cost, more flexible finance.  </i>I recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility.  The banks told me that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.  I also questioned the banks on the relatively high interest rates for SMEs in Ireland compared with those across Europe.</p><p>Access to finance was discussed at the Dairy Forum on 21 June, with an exchange of views with the main banks now a part of the agenda at each meeting.  Before the meeting I formally launched the Dairy Forum&rsquo;s &rsquo;Financial Management Initiative&rsquo;, a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers.  I believe that equipping farmers with better financial planning skills is essential and I am encouraging all farmers to engage with this initiative.</p><p>Access to finance was also discussed at last month&rsquo;s meeting of the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee and we heard from representatives of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  Both are now active in the market and my Department, in cooperation with all the other relevant State bodies, will continue to explore additional funding mechanisms for farmers, the agri-food sector and for SMEs generally.</p><p>In this regard, my Department has just published a request for tender to procure an ex-ante assessment to assess any current failures in the access to finance market in Ireland.  This is a first step towards the potential introduction of Financial Instruments under the EAFRD Rural Development Programme and the EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme.</p><p>In addition, the EU <i>Commission </i>has announced more flexible State aid provisions as part of the response to price volatility, including the possibility of a measure on bridging liquidity gaps. <i>I am </i>working with all the financial institutions, particularly SBCI, to identify potential solutions to providing working capital finance for farmers with liquidity issues.</p></reply>

Fertiliser prices have increased significantly in recent years, in part due to the protection provided by the imposition of duties on non-EU imports, while opportunities to manage price risk through hedging mechanisms are limited.</p>  <p>  The International Food and Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) published a report in February of this year (commissioned by the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association) on the effects of import duty elimination on competition in the EU fertiliser market.  The report concluded that the protection afforded to EU manufacturers by the application of anti-dumping duties and customs tariffs is costing farmers up to &euro;1 billion per annum.</p>  <p>  I believe that appropriate action in this area could be of significant benefit to farmers at this very difficult time.  In addition to the ten-point package that Ireland proposed in the lead-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, we asked the Commission to consider a temporary suspension of import tariffs on fertilisers.</p>  <p>  Other Member States made similar calls, and at the March Council Commissioner Hogan indicated his readiness to raise the matter with Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, Pierre Moscovici, and Internal Market Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska.  At the April Council in Luxembourg, Commissioner Hogan said that he was following up with his colleagues in an effort to secure their agreement to possible changes.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to pursue the matter with the Commission and in consultation with my Member State counterparts, and I hope that progress can be made in the short-term.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-05a.1661.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500087#WRZ02200"><p>I am fully aware of the level of compensation being paid to farmers who have had a TB breakdown and I do not accept that it is inadequate.  It is worth noting also that the significant progress being made in the fight against TB means that there are now fewer reactor numbers and fewer herds restricted than before, thus lessening the chances of farmers being impacted by this disease.</p>  <p>  The primary compensation scheme for farmers whose herds are affected by TB is the On-Farm Market Valuation Scheme under which compensation is payable for cattle removed as reactors. The amount is based on the market value of the animal i.e. the price that might reasonably have been obtained for it, from a purchaser on the open market, if the animal had not been affected by TB.  Each reactor is valued by an independent Valuer and my Department pays the difference between this valuation and the salvage value which the farmer receives directly from the slaughter plant.</p>  <p>  A review of all the TB Eradication Compensation Schemes was recently completed by my Department.  Following that review the maximum ceiling limits, which are payable under the On Farm Market Valuation scheme, for any individual reactor animal removed have been increased.  The ceiling for an individual bovine has increased from &euro;2,800 to &euro;3,000.  Herdowners are also compensated for the loss of one stock bull per breakdown episode and the ceiling for a pedigree stock bull has increased from &euro;3,500 to &euro;5,000.  In addition a new category has been introduced that will compensate up to a maximum &euro;4,000 for the loss of a non-pedigree stock bull.</p>  <p>  Herdowners compensated under the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme may also qualify for supplementary payment under the Depopulation, Income Supplement and Hardship Grants Schemes subject to compliance with the relevant criteria.  A review of the rates payable and criteria applying to these schemes was also completed and has resulted in significant increases in some of the rates payable.  The Income Supplement Scheme has also been expanded ensuring that some herdowners are now receiving compensation where they would not heretofore have qualified.  I would note that these supplementary schemes are unique in Ireland and not the norm in other jurisdictions where there is a TB problem.  For example in Northern Ireland, England and Wales compensation is only payable for the value of the removed reactor.</p>  <p>  In view of the foregoing, I am satisfied that, taking account of the payment from my Department and the price received by the herdowner from the slaughter plant, a farmer, at any given time, receives a level of compensation which adequately reflects the market valuation of reactors, as if they had not been affected by bovine TB and may, in addition, receive additional support where the relevant criteria are met.</p></reply>

There will be major challenges ahead, for the EU, the UK, and for Ireland and we will meet these challenges and minimise adverse impacts on our economy and the free movement of people, goods and services on these islands.  We will also work with both our EU partners and our colleagues in the UK, with the aim of ensuring a strong EU-UK relationship and a well managed withdrawal.</p><p>We are now at the beginning of a new phase in Britain&rsquo;s relations, not just with Ireland, but with Europe as a whole.  We expect this period of negotiated withdrawal to last at least two years and during this time businesses will continue to trade as normal and people will continue to travel as normal between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.  Key actions will be required throughout to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision.  A summary of these actions has been published, and the Government has developed a Contingency Framework which maps the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>Contingency planning in this context is challenging because many of the impacts on Ireland depend on the new arrangements that can be agreed between the UK and the EU.  Managing contingencies will be, by definition, an iterative process as issues emerge and recede in the course of negotiations.  Nevertheless, substantial work has been undertaken across Government to identify the key strategic, policy and operational risks.  This work will be intensified and prioritised across all Government Departments and agencies.  It is important to note that, in the negotiations, we would be one of twenty-seven Member States on the EU side.  In matters of EU competence, the scope for bilateral arrangements has to be seen in that context.  Our primary objective remains to protect and advance this country&rsquo;s interests.</p><p>The all-island Single Electricity Market has delivered an efficient, competitive and secure market for customers since its establishment in 2007.  The governance framework that applies to the all-island electricity market remains in place and is based on national legislation adopted by the Oireachtas and the British Parliament. The Regulator-led Integrated Single Electricity Market or I-SEM project is amending the technical trading rules of the market and will be in place by the end of 2017. This project does not affect the existing legislative and governance structures of the Single Electricity Market.  I will be proceeding with the necessary legislation in the Energy Bill 2016 to facilitate the Regulators in amending the detailed operating rules of the wholesale electricity markets, to deliver efficiencies that will benefit consumers and also provide more flexible market arrangements, for generators, suppliers, demand and renewable electricity producers.</p><p>Existing energy and trading arrangements between Ireland and the UK, ensuring the continuity of mutually dependent energy arrangements and maintaining the long standing history of beneficial co-operation in this sphere, are very important to both jurisdictions on an enduring basis.  As outlined by the Taoiseach, a full assessment of the issues that may arise for energy supply are a priority area under our contingency management arrangements and in this context the Single Electricity Market will be discussed bilaterally with the UK and will form part of our priority discussions with Brussels.</p><p>The relevant Departments, Regulators, and stakeholders in Ireland and Northern Ireland continue to work in the all-island context of the Single Electricity Market and are preparing for the consequences of the UK referendum as they arise, to ensure timely assessment, to minimise any negative impact on energy customers, while continuing to deliver a safe, secure, competitive and reliable supply of energy.</p><p>Ireland has always been highly dependent (over 90% typically) on imports of energy products and in recent years the value of imports was approximately &euro;6.5 billion per year.  This is expected to decline now that Corrib is on stream.  These imports take the form of normal trading by firms in Ireland with firms overseas and inherently involve a degree of currency risk, principally with the US Dollar and sterling.  Volatility in the currency markets is not unexpected in light of the uncertainty caused by the referendum result but as this recedes it could be expected that the markets will stabilise.  In the recently published Government Contingency Framework, economic and trade impacts have been prioritised and a contingency plan was pre-prepared by the Central Bank.  The enterprise agencies are factoring this issue into their own contingency planning.</p><p>In relation to oil, through the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), Ireland has a stockholding of 90 days which is in accordance with EU legislation and International Energy Agency rules.  This is held as a strategic reserve to be used in the event of a supply disruption.  Over 60% of NORA&rsquo;s stocks are held in Ireland with the rest held in other EU Member States, including the United Kingdom.  There is no short term risk to Ireland from this arrangement.  In the longer term, in line with settled policy in the Government White Paper on Energy launched in December 2015, NORA is continuing to maximise the level of its stocks held on the island of Ireland subject to storage availability and value for money considerations.  In the absence of available storage in Ireland, the continued holding of stocks in the UK, including in Northern Ireland, continues to be necessary. This issue will also be part of any discussions Ireland will have with the EU and the UK.</p><p>Ireland is connected with the UK  by a number of gas pipelines and electricity lines and further development of an additional electricity  North-South electricity interconnector is ongoing.  The Energy Union project by the European Commission sets out targets for interconnection between Member States and feasibility studies are underway with France in relation to an electricity interconnector.  When the UK withdraws from the EU we would expect that there would be little impact on the operations of these interconnectors or on supplies of electricity and gas imported from the UK.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that the possibility of facilitating liquid natural gas in Ireland will be examined as part of the Programme for Government.  On gas security, there are well-established provisions in place and these are set to continue and indeed a proposal of the EU Commission on reviewing measures to safeguard security of gas supply is currently being negotiated in Brussels.  A key part of this proposal is increased and improved regional cooperation between Member States. </p><p>There is excellent co-operation between the UK and Ireland on gas and electricity issues and both countries have cooperated very closely at EU level.  It is important that this good cooperation with the UK continues and Ireland will emphasise this point and <font color="#333333">l will continue to work with both our EU partners and our colleagues in the UK, with the aim of ensuring an ongoing strong EU-UK relationship in the context of energy security.</font></p></reply>

By the closing date for applications on 16 September last, forty three applications were received.  This was by far the highest number of applications received under any licensing round in the Irish offshore.</p>  <p>  In the following months my Department undertook a detailed evaluation of these applications in accordance with the award criteria set out in the published notice.  A two-phased approach was taken to the award of Licensing Options under the round, having regard to the very high number of applications received and to the fact that a number of applications had proposed new seismic surveys in 2016.  Evaluation of applications that proposed new seismic surveys in 2016, along with other applications in the same general area, was progressed first.  Following conclusion of the evaluation of these applications the first phase of awards was made in February of this year with fourteen Licensing Options awarded.  The timing of the awards allowed for the preparation and planning of new 3D seismic surveys in the Porcupine Basin and these surveys are currently underway.  Evaluation of the remaining applications concluded in June of this year when a further fourteen Licensing Options were awarded.  The 2015 Licensing Round has been the most successful round held in the Irish offshore to date with a total of twenty eight Licensing Options awarded.</p>  <p>  The White Paper &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015 to 2030" is a complete energy policy update, which sets out a framework to guide policy between now and 2030.  Its objective is to guide a transition to a low carbon energy system, which provides secure supplies of competitive and affordable energy to our citizens and businesses.</p>  <p>  The White Paper envisages that in the short to medium-term, the mix of non-renewables will shift away from more carbon-intensive fuels, like peat and coal, to lower-carbon fuels like natural gas. In the longer-term, fossil fuels will be largely replaced by renewable energy sources.  The White Paper acknowledges that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply between now and 2035.</p>  <p>  The White Paper notes that even with demand reduction, energy efficiency efforts and a greater use of low carbon fuels, the International Energy Agency forecasts that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of the global energy mix out to 2035, especially in transport.  In this context, the development of Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous oil and gas resources has the potential to deliver significant and sustained benefits, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply, import substitution, fiscal return, national and local economic development and technology learning.</p></reply>

With these significant changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar PV in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, contribute to our renewable energy targets, and support economic growth and jobs.

Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) show that in 2015  9.2% of Ireland's energy requirements were met from renewable sources.  More specifically, the SEAI has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.8% of heat and 5.7% of transport were from renewable sources.  The table below summarises the progress made in meeting these targets.  <table><tr><th></th><th>2020</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Overall Renewables Contribution</td><td>16.0%</td><td>9.2%</td></tr><tr><td>RES-E</td><td>40.0%</td><td>25.3%  (of which wind is 21.1%)</td></tr><tr><td>RES-H</td><td>12.0%</td><td>6.8%</td></tr><tr><td>RES-T</td><td>10.0%</td><td>5.7%</td></tr></table></p><p>A number of studies have been undertaken in recent years to assess the economic cost of integrating  increasing amounts of renewable energy into the energy mix.  The All-Island Grid Study, published in 2008, assessed the technical feasibility and the relative costs and benefits associated with various scenarios for increased shares of electricity sourced from renewable energy in the all island power system.  The scenarios were informed by the resource available, technological readiness of the various generation technologies (including wind) and cost required per generated unit.  This study informed the decision to move towards achieving 40% renewable electricity generation in Ireland by 2020.  It concluded that - based on assumptions set out in the report - wind energy represented a cost effective source for electricity generation.</p><p>My Department has been working with the SEAI, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation on a further study to assess the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020.  This work and the related findings will form the basis of a report which, it is envisaged, will be published later this year.</p><p>The abundant wind resource in Ireland means that each unit of installed wind generation capacity generates more units of electricity when compared with other countries and hence needs a lower rate per generated unit of electricity in order to recover the overall costs of the project.  The existing feed-in tariff, REFIT, which is funded from the Public Service Obligation levy on consumer bills, is a very cost effective support for onshore wind development.

The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy.  The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff (REFIT) schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.Work is also ongoing in my Department on the development of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) to encourage the development of Ireland&rsquo;s, diverse, indigenous renewable energy resources.</p><p>Good progress has been made towards meeting the 2020 40% renewable electricity generation target predominantly through onshore wind, which <font color="#0D0D0D">has proved to be the most commercial renewable energy technology in the Irish electricity market.  Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicate that in 2015, 21.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity demand was met by wind generation.  It is expected that approximately 35% of the 40% electricity target for 2020 will be met by wind generation.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  Diversification of the renewable generation portfolio in the longer term will be important for creating a sustainable, carbon free, electricity system and biomass will have a role to play in this regard.  Electricity generated from biomass is already supported through the three REFIT schemes and, depending on electricity demand, the full implementation of current policies could mean that up to 5% of electricity may be generated from biomass in 2020.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  In the heating sector, my Department is working on the introduction of a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to support the deployment of renewable energy for commercial and industrial users of heat in the non-ETS sector.  The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in the renewable heat sector and to help reach Ireland's 12% renewable heat target by 2020.  In 2015 it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources. The new RHI scheme is expected to become available in 2017.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  In the transport sector Ireland aims to meet our 10% renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution out to 2020.  SEAI provisional figures for 2015 indicate 5.7% of our energy needs in the transport sector were met from renewable sources.  Ocean energy is not expected to make any significant contribution to the 2020 target. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The SEAI publication Energy in Ireland 1990 &ndash; 2014 provides further information on progress made in relation of the use of renewable energy in Ireland and is available at the following link:</font></p><p>.</p></reply>

Delivery of high speed broadband is a strategic priority under the Programme for Government.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p>  <p>  The Government had today chosen the Commercial Stimulus Model as the optimum ownership model for the network that will be part-funded by the Exchequer under the procurement process which started in December.  The Government considered two ownership models, having narrowed the options down last December, from five models.  The two models are</p>  <p>  a) Commercial Stimulus (or &lsquo;Gap Funding&rsquo;) &ndash; the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network, with contractual obligations to the Department. </p>  <p>  b) Full Concession &ndash; the private sector finances, designs, builds and operates the network with contractual obligations to the Department.  The asset is handed back to the State after 25 years. </p>  <p>  Both Models would deliver the same network, with the same service specifications and controls, for 25 years.  In both models, the winning bidder(s) will be subject to stringent contract provisions to ensure that the network delivers quality, affordable high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland that cannot access services.  The Department had commissioned detailed costings, down to every individual home in the Intervention Area and, on that basis, had modelled the likely cost of each ownership model. </p>  <p>  While I recognise the potential long-term value in the State owning any network that is built, I am advised that under a Full Concession Model, the entire cost of the project would be placed on the Government&rsquo;s Balance Sheet, with serious implications for the available capital funding over the next five to six years.  Given that both models will deliver the same services and be governed by an almost identical contract(s), I cannot justify reducing the amount of money available to Government for other critical priorities.  I am advised also that the Full Concession Model may take at least six months longer to negotiate as part of the Procurement process and my priority is to have a contract(s) in place as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The current procurement schedule aims to have a contract(s) in place by June 2017.  There are numerous stages in the procurement process and each stage is dependent on a number of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered during the process.</p>  <p>  The two ownership models differ principally after 25 years, when the asset would either revert to the State, or to the full control of a commercial telecoms operator.  I am confident that we can put in place measures to ensure that services continue after 25 years, in the case of the Commercial Stimulus model.  In this regard, I have already raised the question of a Universal Service Obligation (USO) for High Speed Broadband, at EU level and have also had discussions with ComReg about a form of USO in areas where commercial providers have already built high speed broadband networks. </p></reply>

In addition, a number of other schemes targeted at removing bottlenecks and upgrading port access, will commence subject to development consent.  These include the Mallow Relief Road, Adare By-Pass  and the N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy Road. It was not possible to include the M20 in the Capital Plan as the scale of investment to deliver it as originally proposed was not affordable.</p>  <p>  However, as part of its work on the proposed Mallow Relief Road, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is examining whether the Mallow project can be progressed in such a way that it facilitates the development of the N20 in phases.  If work on that project and additional studies show that a phased approach is feasible, the N20 upgrade could be considered as part of the planned mid-term review of the Capital Plan.  In the meantime, TII is funding a feasibility study on the proposed Mallow Relief Road this year.</p></reply>

Where there is an undue delay by a road authority in taking a road in charge, there is provision under section 180 of the Planning Act 2000 for a majority of the qualified electors, who own or occupy the houses within the estate in question, to require the road authority to initiate proceedings under section 11 of the Roads Act, 1993.</p>  <p>  While certain traffic laws apply to public places generally, such as estates that have not been taken in charge, this is not the case in respect of speed limits, as these are provided for under the legislation governing public roads.  My Department is currently considering, with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General, the possible application of speed limits elsewhere than on public roads, having regard to not only road safety but also enforcement and other relevant legal issues.</p>  <p>  Where local authorities have taken housing estates in charge, they may, as part of the measures to improve road safety, go through the process of adopting bye-laws for the 30km/h limit for roads within the estates.  As the Deputy may be aware, 30km/h is a special speed limit and statutory responsibility for setting such limit in respect of any specific road is vested in local authorities under section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 and requires a public consultation process followed by a decision by the Elected Members. </p>  <p>  I am also making provision for an additional speed limit of 20km/h in the Road Traffic Bill 2016 which is due to be passed into law later this year.  This will then be available, along with the 30km/h limit, for implementation by local authorities in specific areas, including housing estates, following the required public consultation.</p></reply>

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open-up services market, and offer predictable conditions for investors.</p>  <p>  The EU-Canada Agreement will save on duty costs as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms. </p>  <p>  In May this year, the Council had an exchange of views on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the process towards signature and provisional application of the agreement.  The European Commission and Member States highlighted the high quality of the agreement reached with Canada and expressed the desire to work towards signature of the agreement at the October EU-Canada Summit.  The Commission advised the Council of its intention to submit a proposal for a decision on signature of CETA before the Summer.  I understand that the Commission will adopt their proposal this week.  It is a matter for the EU Commission to decide if they wish to publish their proposal.</p>  <p>  There are differing views on the legal position on competence and the CETA.  The European Commission is of the view that CETA falls within the competence of the EU only.  We will need to wait and see the formal proposal from the Commission and, importantly, the legal basis for this.  It will be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  </p>  <p>  The provisions of the CETA on investment dispute resolution relate solely to the CETA as an international trade agreement.  Such trade agreements are not part of domestic law.  This is why separate adjudication arrangements are required in the event of disputes under the agreement.</p></reply>

The export figure is now almost double what it was 10 years ago (&euro;10.73bn in 2005).</p><p>Exports to the UK increased by 12% last year to reach &euro;7.5bn.  Significantly however, in the context of Brexit, UK exports, as a share of total exports, have reduced from 45% to 37% over the period 2005 to 2015 as our clients have diversified their export base.  High Growth Markets (e.g. China, Brazil, etc.) have continued to increase in importance over the past 10 years and at &euro;2.5bn they now account for 12% of total exports compared to 7% in 2005. </p><p>Despite the continued diversification of the Enterprise Ireland client export base, the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the EU will present significant new challenges for Irish companies exporting to the UK.  In response, Enterprise Ireland has begun its plans to support clients exporting to the UK, including:</p><p>1.  <b>Information and Guidance:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will run an information campaign including: practical guides, online information and webinars, an updated UK market access guide and regional seminars in Ireland and the UK.  These will provide guidance on issues including: the implications of trading with the UK, improving competitiveness, reducing supply chain costs, accessing funding, finance, foreign exchange, employment regulations and legal issues. </p><p>There is also a dedicated email address: brexithelp@enterprise-ireland.com; an Enterprise Ireland helpline: 01-7272727 and dedicated webpage: .</p><p>2.  <b>UK Market Support:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland's UK team, based in London, will provide support to clients to help identify key business opportunities in the short and medium terms.  They will also provide advice and support on responding to the implications of Brexit such as improving competitiveness and reducing supply chain costs. </p><p>3.  <b>Competitiveness and Market Development supports:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will intensify its work with clients to improve their competitiveness in the market through its management capability and development programmes. </p><p>4.  <b>Market Diversification Support:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will intensify its strategy of supporting clients to diversify into new markets.  As part of this strategy, Enterprise Ireland will provide increased internationalisation supports to assist client companies to evaluate new market opportunities.  It will also intensify its International Trade &amp;amp; Investment events schedule for the rest of 2016 to include trade missions and events to Northern Europe, USA, China, India and other high growth markets.  Enterprise Ireland will also host an International Markets week in the first week of October in Ireland, to provide Irish exporters with access to its overseas market advisors. </p><p>5.  <b>International Sector Clustering Strategy:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will expand its focus on promoting Irish sectoral cluster capabilities in key sectors to international buyers in growth markets including Northern Europe, USA and Asia Pacific.</p><p>I am satisfied that Enterprise Ireland is already intensively engaged with its clients on the implications of Brexit.  As the situation evolves and specific challenges emerge, I will keep under review the resources required to address them.</p></reply>

There are seven IDA Ireland client companies in Cavan and five in Monaghan.  This existing client base has performed well with a total of 1,311 IDA supported jobs in Cavan and Monaghan, 81 new jobs have been supported by IDA in these counties in 2015.</p><p>Figures for IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits are collated on a quarterly basis and are set out in the following table together with a breakdown of jobs and new jobs.  It is important to note, however, that data on site visits is not an accurate measure of the level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) activity in a region or county.  That is partly because approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies. </p><p>IDA Ireland positions the North East as having strong clusters in international business services and manufacturing, given the presence there of such companies as eBay, PayPal, Liberty Mutual, Cargotec, Wellman and Abbot.  These international brands are an attraction and serve as significant reference corporations for additional companies that are considering locating to the North East.  The proximity of the region to Dublin also helps increase its attractiveness to prospective investors. </p><p>IDA Ireland remains committed to significantly increasing the number of investments outside Dublin, including the North East, and the Agency will continue to work with both stakeholders and existing clients with that goal in mind.  It is the case, however, that while IDA Ireland does attempt to influence the choice of location by investors, the final decision as to where to both visit and ultimately locate is taken in all cases by the client company itself.  </p><p><b>IDA Ireland Jobs Statistics 2015; Site Visits 2015 and Quarter 1 2016 for Cavan and Monaghan</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>No. of Companies</th><th>Total Jobs</th><th>New Jobs<br /><br />2015</th><th>Site Visits 2015</th><th>Site Visits Q1 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>7</td><td>1,165</td><td>29</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>5</td><td>146</td><td>52</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Simultaneously, my Department had secured sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) to fill key posts within the terms of the Employment Control Framework (ECF) which guided the operation of the Moratorium.</p><p>Since the lifting of the Moratorium and the move to pay-budget limits, my Department has filled a modest number of vacancies and, in addition, we have grown the number of graduates recruited at Administrative Officer level, recruited a number of Forensic Accountants for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, appointed an additional Division (Deputy Chairman and two Members) plus an additional Deputy Chairman to the Labour Court as part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) reforms which, among other things, will see the wind-up of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) once that body has disposed of its legacy caseload.  My Department has also recruited a number of Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) for a finite period associated with Companies Act conversion project and to assist with a spike in demand in Employment Permits.</p><p>The statistics in this regard to end-June 2016 are as follows:<table><tr><th>New Posts</th><th>End 2011</th><th>End 2012</th><th>End 2013</th><th>End 2014</th><th>End 2015</th><th>2016 to date</th></tr><tr><td>Administrative Officer</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Forensic Accountant (ODCE)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Labour Court Members</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Temporary Clerical Officers</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>13</td><td>1.5</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I note that the SNA model operates in primary and secondary schools.</p>  <p>  For the pre-school sector, I recently unveiled details of a new model of supports, funded by my Department, which will support children with a disability to access the free pre-school programme.  The new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is now available to enable children with disabilities to access and fully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme.  The model will deliver seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme.  The new model focuses on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability, their strengths and their needs.  It is not an SNA model, but is much more comprehensive, and will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to pre-school.</p>  <p>  The main supports offered under the model include:</p>  <p> - A new higher education programme to upskill early years practitioners in inclusive early years care and education.  My Department will fund a small capitation increase where service providers employ a graduate from the programme;</p>  <p> - A dedicated website containing comprehensive information resources for parents and providers.  Information can be accessed at www.preschoolaccess.ie;</p>  <p> - Advice and support from a team of 50 experts in early years education for children with disabilities;</p>  <p> - A scheme for the provision of specialised equipment, appliances and minor building alterations;</p>  <p> - Therapeutic intervention where this is needed to allow a child enrol, and fully participate in, pre-school; and</p>  <p> - Additional capitation to enable the pre-school leader to buy-in additional support or reduce the staff to child ratio where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation.</p>  <p>  Parents who consider that their child will need additional assistance to participate in the ECCE Programme should contact their pre-school provider as soon as possible to discuss their child&rsquo;s needs.  The service provider, in partnership with the parents, will then submit an application to Pobal for supports under the AIM model to allow them to plan for pre-school enrolment in September 2016.  Signed parental consent is required to complete the application process.</p></reply>

My Department has requested that Tusla provide figures, broken down by area, for cases awaiting the allocation of a social worker that involve adult disclosures of retrospective abuse allegations.  Tusla has informed me that they are planning to commence the routine return of this information on a monthly basis by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In 2015, Tusla conducted a National Review of Cases Awaiting Allocation which included information on the number of retrospective cases.  The review showed, at February 2015, that of the 8,865 cases awaiting allocation nationally there were 1,204 cases of retrospective abuse disclosures.  The review indicated that of these 1,204 retrospective cases, 27% were a High priority (327), 46% Medium priority (550) and 27% Low Priority (327).  The review did not look at the average waiting times for retrospective cases awaiting allocation of a social worker.</p>  <p>  For the 2016 review, Tusla is examining all cases awaiting allocation including retrospective abuse cases.  This review will examine each individual case and the priority of same.  The review will be concluded by year end and will provide detailed information to my Department in respect of such matters.</p>  <p>  The current operational policy on dealing with disclosures by adults is included in the "Policy and Procedures for Responding to Allegations of Child Abuse and Neglect".  This policy was approved in September 2014 and is available on request directly from Tusla.  I am arranging to have a copy forwarded by Tusla to the Deputy.  The policy takes into account Children First guidelines and relevant Court judgements as they apply to fair procedure and due process.  A full national review of this policy has been completed and a revised text is to be considered shortly by the senior management team within Tusla, and its National Policy Oversight Committee, for approval and circulation.</p>  <p>  Under Section 3.6 of the Children First (2011) guidelines, when a retrospective disclosure of abuse is made, an assessment must be taken to ensure there is no current risk to any child who may be in contact with the alleged abuser.  Should risk be identified, Tusla will work with other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;ochana, for investigative purposes.  Reporting a child abuse concern, whether it is current or historical, should be reported to Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;ochana, in line with the Children First Guidance.</p></reply>

The system will also have the capacity to facilitate the integration and sharing of information on child protection and welfare cases between Tusla areas where appropriate.  Individuals using the system will be required to have authorised access to ensure access security, data security and client privacy.</p>  <p>  The NCCIS has been piloted in Tusla&rsquo;s Mid-West region (North Tipperary, Clare and Limerick).  Tusla intends to roll out the system nationally and for it to become fully operational in all areas between now and the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  A high level Steering Group, which is co-chaired by my Department and Tusla has been established to oversee the delivery of the NCCIS project within the required timeframes and budget.</p></reply>

My Department communicated the rationale for the cut in funding to Westmeath CCC at this time.  As a consequence, the allocation of funding to Westmeath CCC was reduced from &euro;316,829 (2010 allocation) to &euro;277,226, representing a reduction of 12.5%.  It is also my understanding that my Department advised the CCC Chairpersons of the requirement to implement reductions to CCC staff salaries aligned to the agreed Local Authority pay scales.</p>  <p>  In 2012, my Department and Pobal conducted a review of funding allocations to the CCCs under a Revised Allocations Framework.  The rationale for the Revised Allocations Framework was to implement a more balanced allocation of available funding and also to implement further required national savings of 8% in the overall CCCs' budget over the two years 2013/1014.  The analysis of funding allocations indicated that a number of CCCs, when compared with each other, had allocations that appeared to be disproportionate to their population and service profiles.  The review resulted in a reduction in the funding allocation to Westmeath CCC, from &euro;277,226 in 2012 to &euro;241,000 in 2014, representing a reduction of 13%.  Westmeath CCC was informed by my Department of this reduction together with the rationale and methodology used to arrive at the decision.  &euro;241,000 is the current level of funding allocated to Westmeath CCC in 2016.</p>  <p>  I understand that there are currently 2,345 unique children registered in Westmeath under the following DCYA programmes: Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the three programmes collectively known as the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programme (i.e ASSC -Afterschool Childcare, CEC - Community Employment Childcare and CETS - Childcare Education and Training Support).</p>  <p>  33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) were established in 2001 to advance the provision of childcare facilities in their local areas.  They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, childcare providers and parents.  There are now 30 CCCs, as Limerick City and Limerick County CCCs have amalgamated, as have Waterford City and Waterford County CCC and North and South Tipperary.  Each Committee has a distinct legal identity and board of directors.  CCCs receive funding from my Department for the operations of the Committee, allowing each one to employ staff and implement actions contained in its strategic plan, which are approved by my Department to reflect national policy objectives.  Pobal acts as managing agent on behalf of the Department in relation to performance of individual CCCs.  Pobal appraises and monitors the local planning and implementation of activity and outcomes of each CCC associated with my Department's funding; and supports CCCs individually and collectively.</p>  <p>  The allocation of funding to CCCs is a matter which is constantly under review within my Department.  At present, my Department has no budget available to reverse the reduction in the allocation of funding to Westmeath CCC but it is something which may be reviewed at a future point.  I recognise and appreciate the valuable work conducted by the CCCs in assisting my Department with the operation of the various childcare schemes, in supporting providers to develop and deliver high quality services and in providing advice to parents.</p></reply>

The Centre was in receipt of funding from November 2005 to March 2016.</p>  <p>  In December 2014, Tusla met members of the Centre's Voluntary Board of Management regarding the provision of funding to the Centre under the Family Resource Centre Programme.</p>  <p>  Tusla was concerned that despite three recruitment processes, the Centre had been without a full-time Co-Ordinator since March 2013.  This had clearly affected the management and operation of the Centre in terms of services to children and families in the community and the continued development of the FRC in line with Tusla&rsquo;s priorities.  While Tusla acknowledged the work of Centre, it was decided that the situation could not continue as the centre was clearly not operating to its full potential.</p>  <p>  Tusla fully recognises the need for community-based family support services serving the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare.  To that end, Tusla worked with these communities to ensure that the funding currently available under the Family Resource Centre Programme is directed to the provision of a community-based service, one that is operating to its full potential and which best supports and promotes the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families.</p>  <p>  Consistent with this approach, it was decided to establish a new Family Resource Centre in Kenmare to serve the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare.</p>  <p>  Tusla is working with the Kenmare Committee to set up a Voluntary Board of Management for the new FRC.  As soon as the Voluntary Board of Management is established and a legal entity is formed, a co-ordinator will be recruited for the Centre.</p>  <p>  The Kenmare committee agreed to accept the two employees who were previously employed in the Centre referred to by the Deputy.  These employees were informed in writing by the Kenmare Committee that it was in the process of setting up an FRC in Kenmare and this Centre will be their new employer when established.  Kenmare FRC are currently seeking premises to establish the centre.  On 1 April, 2016, the Kenmare Committee assumed the duties of employer for the two employees, on an interim basis, until the Kenmare FRC is formally established.</p>  <p>  There has been no interruption to services in the Sneem area.  The funding allocation for the Centre in question will be transferred to Kenmare.  A budget of approximately &euro;114,000 will be allocated to Kenmare FRC in 2016.</p>  <p>  Tusla, as a statutory funder of Family Resource Centres, has advised that it will be meeting the Board and representatives of the Centre on July 6th, 2016 to discuss the closure.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-05a.1850.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070500090#WRCC03700"><p>Budget 2016 provided &euro;16m to create an additional 3,200 (full-time equivalent) Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) childcare places, or approximately 8,000 places based on average uptake.  Traditionally, CCS has only been available through community (not for profit) childcare services of which there are 900 across the country.  Eligible families who did not live in an area with a community service could not traditionally access the scheme.  At the end of 2015, using savings from that year, my Department lifted the cap on the number of CCS places available though community services and encouraged these services to provide additional CCS places.  However, there was insufficient capacity within the community sector to meet all eligible families needs and hence my Department extended the terms of the CCS scheme so that it could be provided by private childcare providers across the country.  This was to ensure that eligible families, regardless of where they lived, could access this important childcare subvention.  The Community Childcare Subvention Private (CCSP) programme launched in March of this year.</p><p>Of the 8000 subvented childcare places available, 803 (full-time equivalent) childcare places (or approximately 2,014 part-time) are available in Dublin.  The balance of 2,397 (full-time equivalent) childcare places (or approximately 5,986 part-time) are available on a pro-rata basis across the remainder of the country.  These numbers can be broken down by area in Dublin as follows:<table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Full-time Equivalent places</th><th>Numbers of part-time places / Children</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>259</td><td>650</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown</td><td>121</td><td>305</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>221</td><td>554</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td>202</td><td>505</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>803</td><td>2,014</td></tr></table></p><p>Thus far, 532 private childcare providers have registered for the CCSP Programme.  Applications for this programme have been received for 1,227 individual children (includes approved and provisional applications).  Of this number, 33 are in Dublin city, 18 are in South Dublin and 9 are in Fingal.</p><p>My Department has been monitoring the take-up of CCSP places and will be instituting a number of initiatives to increase public awareness of the CCSP programme.  These initiatives include advertisements on social media sites, local and national newspapers and within community settings and support services.  It is hoped that as a result of this campaign, additional  families will avail of this programme.</p><p>The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements.  In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility.</p></reply>

My Department communicated the rationale for the cut in funding to Westmeath CCC at this time.  As a consequence, the allocation of funding to Westmeath CCC was reduced from &euro;316,829 (2010 allocation) to &euro;277,226, representing a reduction of 12.5%.  It is also my understanding that my Department advised the CCC Chairpersons of the requirement to implement reductions to CCC staff salaries aligned to the agreed Local Authority pay scales.</p>  <p>  In 2012, my Department and Pobal conducted a review of funding allocations to the CCCs under a Revised Allocations Framework.  The rationale for the Revised Allocations Framework was to implement a more balanced allocation of available funding and also to implement further required national savings of 8% in the overall CCCs' budget over the two years 2013/1014.  The analysis of funding allocations indicated that a number of CCCs, when compared with each other, had allocations that appeared to be disproportionate to their population and service profiles.  The review resulted in a reduction in the funding allocation to Westmeath CCC, from &euro;277,226 in 2012 to &euro;241,000 in 2014, representing a reduction of 13%.  Westmeath CCC was informed by my Department of this reduction together with the rationale and methodology used to arrive at the decision.  &euro;241,000 is the current level of funding allocated to Westmeath CCC in 2016.</p>  <p>  I understand that there are currently 2,345 unique children registered in Westmeath under the following DCYA programmes: Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the three programmes collectively known as the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programme (i.e ASSC -Afterschool Childcare, CEC - Community Employment Childcare and CETS - Childcare Education and Training Support).</p>  <p>  33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) were established in 2001 to advance the provision of childcare facilities in their local areas.  They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, childcare providers and parents.  There are now 30 CCCs, as Limerick City and Limerick County CCCs have amalgamated, as have Waterford City and Waterford County CCC and North and South Tipperary.  Each Committee has a distinct legal identity and board of directors.  CCCs receive funding from my Department for the operations of the Committee, allowing each one to employ staff and implement actions contained in its strategic plan, which are approved by my Department to reflect national policy objectives.  Pobal acts as managing agent on behalf of the Department in relation to performance of individual CCCs.  Pobal appraises and monitors the local planning and implementation of activity and outcomes of each CCC associated with my Department's funding; and supports CCCs individually and collectively.</p>  <p>  The allocation of funding to CCCs is a matter which is constantly under review within my Department.  At present, my Department has no budget available to reverse the reduction in the allocation of funding to Westmeath CCC but it is something which may be reviewed at a future point.  I recognise and appreciate the valuable work conducted by the CCCs in assisting my Department with the operation of the various childcare schemes, in supporting providers to develop and deliver high quality services and in providing advice to parents.</p></reply>
