I have made provision for this in Budget 2017.  The inclusion of this provision in the programme for Government reflects a commitment by the Government to ensuring the continued viability of the sheep sector in Ireland.<font color="#1F497D"> </font></p><p>The sheep sector makes an important contribution to the agrifood economy generating an output value of &euro;320 million and exporting in excess of &euro;230 million in 2015.  Furthermore the sector also makes a vital contribution to the economy supporting over 34,000 farm families directly in addition to providing several thousand jobs indirectly in rural areas also. </p><p>My Department has engaged in extensive consultation with farm organisations to discuss the proposed new scheme in the context of the specific requirements of the Rural Development Programme.</p><p>As a result of these consultations my Department has proposed an animal welfare scheme for the sheep sector as part of its second amendment to Ireland's Rural Development Programme.  This proposed amendment is currently with the European Commission for examination and my Department awaits the outcome.  I intend to ensure that the scheme will be made available to as many sheep farmers as possible and that it will provide for participation by both hill and lowland flock owners.  </p><p>In relation to the specific terms and conditions of the scheme, we have to wait for final approval from the Commission for the scheme before these can be finalised fully.  I am sensitive to the needs of new entrants and subject to the commission approval, and it is my intention to facilitate the group of farmers referred to by you.  In this context we propose to<font color="#1F497D"> </font>make provision in the terms and conditions of the scheme for those new entrants to farming in 2016 who would not have been in a position to have ewes in the reference year.  Full details on this will be announced when the details of the scheme are finalised. </p></reply>

The carbon navigator is an online farm management package developed by Bord Bia and Teagasc.  It quantifies the environmental gains that can be made on each farm by setting targets in key areas such as grassland management.  It is a very useful and simple tool which will allow applicants to look at changes which can be made on their farm in areas such as the length of the grazing season or average calving rate.  It will then illustrate what such changes would mean in terms of reduced Green House Gas emissions from the herd and the increased profitability associated with such a change.  From 2017 participants must subsequently submit data annually to allow for an update of the carbon navigator. </p><p>My Department has provided for the training of advisors in the completion of the carbon navigator.  The list of trained advisors is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie</i>.  Those BDGP participants who have not already completed the carbon navigator should immediately make contact with the advisor of their choice and make an appointment to complete their 2016 carbon navigator.  Payment for completing the carbon navigator is incorporated into the farmers&rsquo; annual BDGP payment while the advisory cost will be paid directly to their chosen advisor by the Department upon successful completion. </p><p>Failure to complete the carbon navigator by the 30 November will result in penalties being applied to payments, and, if not completed by 30 April will result in exclusion from the BDGP with any payments already made being recouped. </p><p>As of 28 November almost 22,000 participants in BDGP have completed a carbon navigator.  I recently extended the deadline for completion by a month until 30 November to allow farmers greater time for completion.  My Department has been in regular contact with those farmers who have not yet completed the carbon navigator over the last few weeks to remind them of this requirement.</p></reply>

Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.</p>  <p>  Consequently, all BPS and Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme applications are subject to robust administrative checks prior to payment.  The main element of the administrative check is an area assessment.  This is achieved by using the LPIS which currently records some 1 million individual land parcels.  Such eligibility checks are required to protect the annual drawdown of the EU funds and to avoid disallowances.  Only valid applications under the BPS and ANC that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid.  </p>  <p>  In relation to over-claims specifically, the procedure in place is for the application to be processed for payment using the area determined during the digitising process.  Any deductions arising on foot of an over-claim at that stage are made at the time and the remainder of the payment due is made  to the applicant.  The applicants concerned are advised of the outcome and offered the opportunity to appeal.  The Department updates its data in relation to issues such as possible over-claims on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued accuracy of its systems.</p>  <p>  Payments under the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme commenced on 17th October, which is the earliest date allowed under the EU legislation.  To date payments in excess of &euro;792m have issued to over 120,000 applicants under the BPS.  My Department is prioritising the processing of all outstanding cases and preparations are also now being finalised for the issuing of the balancing payment of the BPS from 1 December.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-30a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016113000053#WRA01200"><p>Ireland is a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its main agricultural commodities.  Therefore producer prices in Ireland are largely determined by commodity prices on world markets, rather than by production levels within Ireland itself.  We have seen significant commodity price volatility on world markets over the last few years.  However, there are measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods.  Direct payments, estimated by Teagasc at an average of over &euro;17,000 per farm in 2015, provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility.  </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agrifood sector, identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector, and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.  </p>  <p>  Food Wise is not just about expanding production, I believe that moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced, is an important hedge against volatility. </p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success.  I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the twelve individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  Since taking up office, one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the sustained period of lower commodity prices on farmers.  I met with a range of stakeholders in advance of the recent Budget and I have been engaged, both at National and EU level, to address the issues involved and to ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and resilient sector.  As part of the recent Budget, I announced a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; to alleviate the pressures of income volatility through:</p>  <p>  - Lower Cost Finance: I announced plans for an &lsquo;Agri Cashflow Support Loan&rsquo; fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans at an interest rate of 2.95%, for amounts up to &euro;150,000 and for terms up to six years.</p>  <p>  - Tax Measures: I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, allowing for an opt-out in an exceptional year. </p>  <p>  - Farm Payments: Spending on farm schemes through the Rural Development Programme will see &euro;601 million go directly to farmers in 2017, including a new &euro;25 million sheep welfare scheme and increased participation in GLAS, BDGP &amp;amp; TAMS.  This is on top of &euro;1.2 billion paid through the Basic Payments Scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agri-taxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-30a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016113000053#WRA01400"><p>The objective of the Commonage Management Plan (CMP) is to ensure that farming activity on commonages is carried out at environmentally sustainable levels to prevent both under grazing and over grazing and if necessary to set out collective actions such as controlled burning.  </p>  <p>  My Department provided specific training for approved Commonage Advisors assigned to prepare these plans.  Detailed information is published on the Department Website for each commonage and includes the names of all shareholders, the indicative minimum and maximum stocking levels each commonage can carry and also the indicative minimum and maximum stocking density for each shareholder within a commonage irrespective of whether the shareholder is a GLAS applicant or not.  The information available to the advisor preparing the plan should be sufficient in most cases but on assessing the commonage on the ground it may become evident that the indicative figures need adjustment because of the vegetative condition of the commonage.  </p>  <p>  To prepare the best possible plan to ensure continued delivery of sustainable practices and to support GLAS scheme payments for commonages it is in the interests of all farmers using the commonage that the total grazing compliment be established.  This is important for all shareholders because if the commonage land is not maintained in an eligible condition payments under CAP Pillar 1 could be affected to the detriment of all shareholders.  The only requirement that the Department has is that a sustainable management plan for all the commonage be prepared and it is in shareholders own best interests that the person drawing up the plan is provided with the best possible information.  The question of GLAS penalties will only arise where on inspection non compliance is found and where further degradation of the commonage continues.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-30a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016113000053#WRA01600"><p>I note that the Deputy refers to a report published by the former Joint Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Fisheries in January 2014 which put forward 29 recommendations on a wide range of issues concerning the functions of a number of Government departments and state agencies.  The Deputy has drawn specific attention to the recommendation concerning heritage licences for traditional fishing practices in rural coastal and island communities.  The intended objective of such heritage licences was, according to the report, to optimally facilitate traditional fishing practices in conjunction with the establishment of a producer organisation representing vessels under a certain length overall in those designated areas.    </p>  <p>  There have been some important changes in the landscape since this report made its recommendations, and particularly in terms of representation of rural coastal communities in sea-fisheries policy making.  The National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) and Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) were established in May 2014 and have now been up and running for 2 years.  The Forums are consultative structures which provide arenas for inshore fishermen to develop proposals on inshore fisheries management, including compliance and data gathering.  The Inshore Forums are representative of the inshore fishing boats, generally less than 12m in overall length and focus on sea-fisheries management in the coastal waters within 6 nautical miles.       </p>  <p>  To date, from its first meeting in January 2015, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum has met 8 times.  These meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies &amp;amp; initiatives.  As a result of the successful discussions with the Forum, NIFF members have been included in a number of sea-fisheries consultative platforms namely: the SFPA Consultative Committee, the Quota Management Advisory Committee, the Bord Bia/BIM market advisory group, the EMFF Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (which oversees implementation of the EMFF in Ireland), the Fisheries Industry Science Partnership (chaired by the Marine Institute) and the Celtic Sea Herring management advisory committee.  This gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on the allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on market development initiatives, on data collection and scientific research and, perhaps most importantly, on how funding is utilised.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the NIFF is taking the industry lead in setting priorities for the policy development for the inshore sector and I give consideration to recommendations from the NIFF.  In our meetings, we have discussed a whole series of practical things we can do to help the inshore sector, including the development of artisan fisheries, funding for inshore sector projects and management measures for shellfish fisheries, such as the restrictions on recreational potting that were introduced in February. </p>  <p>  Recommendations such as those in the former sub-committee&rsquo;s report regarding heritage licences and producer organisations are matters which the NIFF may wish to consider and, if deemed appropriate, bring forward.  Any proposals however must be examined in the context of a discussion with the overall fishing industry and within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>  In July this year, I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.  I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.</p><p>  Environmental sustainability is at the heart of Food Wise, which states that &ldquo;environmental protection and economic competitiveness are equal and complementary: one cannot be achieved at the expense of the other&rdquo;.  An Environmental Sustainability Subgroup was established under the auspices of HLIC to monitor and drive the sustainability actions outlined in Food Wise 2025.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s whole of Government approach to sustainability includes development of coherent and cost-effective policies to meet the twin challenges of sustainable food production and climate change in the agriculture and land use sector.  The national policy position is based on an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  Officials from my Department work very closely with other Departments and in particular, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is the lead in this area.</p><p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland is taking the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions in the Irish agriculture sector.  Nevertheless, we cannot afford to be complacent, and I acknowledge that meeting our international commitments on climate change will be challenging.  That is why the Rural Development Programme, worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years, is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.</p><p>  My Department is also contributing to the National Mitigation Plan, which is being prepared under the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  The work on the national plan is overseen by Government through a hierarchy of committees and sub-groups, with independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council.  These committees and groups include the Cabinet Committee and the Senior Officials' Group on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, a Technical Research and Modelling Group and a Domestic Climate Finance Group.</p><p>  DAFM is a key stakeholder in the implementation of the National Regulations  referred to as the Nitrates or the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) Regulations.  These regulations protect water through the implementation of specific controls and are aimed at minimising the loss of Nutrients from Agriculture.  Substantial investments has been made both by my Department and the farming community to implement the GAP measures under the Nitrates Action Programme since their introduction in 2006.  Additionally, under our Agri-environment scheme, GLAS, farmers in areas of high water status and vulnerable water bodies have priority entry to the scheme whilst measures such as 'Fencing of Watercourses' within the scheme are designed specifically to enhance water quality.  The scheme is therefore very much targeted at improving water quality and this objective is supported by both the Knowledge Transfer and the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes. </p></reply>

The immediate impact of Brexit has been seen in our currency exchange rates and has affected our primary major export market. Beef production is also up here and in the UK in 2016.</p><p>Looking at the market outlook for the remainder of the year it is estimated that the total number of cattle available for slaughter at export plants for the year 2016 is expected to be between 70,000 and 80,000 greater than 2015.  Figures for the year so far to the week ending 20th November 2016 show that approximately 71,000 extra cattle have been slaughtered so far this year compared to the same period in 2015, an increase of 5.2%.</p><p>I am very much aware of the impact that the expansion in the national dairy herd will have on the Irish beef herd and this matter was discussed by all stakeholders at the most recent meeting of the Beef Roundtable.  The true impact any increase in the number of cattle in the national herd will have on the beef market will be determined by different factors such as slaughter dates which will vary depending on the system of production on different farms.  I have also asked Teagasc to undertake some analysis on the routes to market for the increased number of dairy calves and they have recently completed this work.  We will now analyse it with the relevant stakeholders and consider some next steps.</p><p>One of the key elements in coping with an increased supply in Irish beef is ensuring that there is a market for such beef.  There is a strong demand for meat globally including beef and  figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets show a projected growth of per capita beef consumption of 2.1% for 2016.  Whilst we exported approximately 97% of our beef exports in 2015 to the UK and EU I am very conscious of the importance of growing international markets as a valuable outlet for any increased Irish beef production.  Indeed this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Very significant progress has been made in this context in recent years and my Department is currently in the process of attempting to secure beef access to a range of Third Countries including China, South Korea, Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam.  This builds on the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.  This is a vital means of providing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef in addition to our existing European markets. </p><p>I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers especially in an environment where the number of calf births has increased in recent years.  The recent opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports has seen over 8,000 cattle make the trip so far, a number which will increase further by the end of 2016.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced which is a positive and welcome development.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.</p><p>One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation with 90% of our food produce leaving the island. It is for this reason I led a major trade mission to four Asian Countries in September and one to Algeria and Morocco at the beginning of November<font color="#1F497D">.</font>It is only through further increasing our footprint internationally that we will help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agrifood sector to realise its full potential. </p><p>My Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia will continue to work to ensure that any increase in production from the Irish beef herd can deliver a viable return to the Irish Beef sector and the primary producer.  I allocated additional funding to Bord Bia in Budget 2017 for the specific purpose of dealing with the impact of Brexit which help to support Irish food and drink exports in 2017.  This, in addition to the opening of a new office by Bord Bia in Singapore this year, will ensure that exports of Irish beef are promoted effectively to provide viable export markets for any increases in Irish beef production.</p></reply>

In terms of total forest cover the target is 18% by 2050. The inventory is repeated every 5 years and the 2017 inventory is currently underway.</p>  <p>  The current Forestry Programme, covering the period 2015-2020, ensures continued State support for the two key objectives of increasing forest cover and wood mobilisation.  Almost &euro;500 million of investment over the six year programme period will facilitate an increase in forest cover by almost 44,000 hectares over the period of the Programme.  The level of afforestation grant and premiums, allied to the tax treatment of income from forests provide good incentives for land-owners to plant a proportion of their holding.  Forests established in the period since 1990 are forecast to remove up to 4.5m tonnes per annum of carbon dioxide over the period 2021-2030. </p>  <p>  In addition to carbon sequestration following the creation of new forests, climate change mitigation also occurs when forest-based biomass replaces fossil fuels for heating or power generation.  This helps to reduce the dependence on imported fossil fuels.  The new Forestry for Fibre scheme allows landowners to plant fast growing species for fuel supply into local heating markets and for CHP and other energy uses.  Support for thinning and forest road building will also help mobilise forest-based biomass for heat and power uses. </p></reply>

This sector is a very important area in the agricultural economy but it has been a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.</p>  <p>  Only last week, I corresponded in detail with the Deputy on this issue and I wish to re-state the position again today in the House.  You will be aware that I recently chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector.  As I said at the time and I wish repeat, this meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry</p>  <p>  At that meeting, I outlined that one of my chief priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance to the sector and in this regard, I was happy to announce on Budget Day, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme.  This financial instrument has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of  &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  </p>  <p>  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.  This is a cash flow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs.  The loans are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts.  I  also recently welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme, which will be operational as early as possible in 2017.</p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This will be available immediately, for this year&rsquo;s tax liability, and this will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns. </p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made this year in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.  Advance payments commenced on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations.  Up to last week, &euro;791.7 million has been paid out to 120,224 farmers and payments are ongoing.</p>  <p>  I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  My Department will also be opening a TAMS Schemes specifically for the Tillage Sector.</p>  <p>  I also stressed at the recent Tillage stakeholders meeting and I want to restate my view to the House, that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry, to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.</p></reply>

Reciprocal access to fishing grounds and shared stocks is one of those key issues. </p>  <p>  Fish stocks are a shared resource managed under the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union.  Nearly all of the main commercial stocks upon which the Irish fisheries sector is reliant are shared to some degree with the UK.  In addition, many of our traditional fishing grounds lie within UK waters.  Any change to the existing situation could have very serious negative consequences for our fleets.</p>  <p>  With regard to territorial waters, that is those waters up the 12 mile limit, the UK and Ireland share certain access rights in the 6-12 mile zone.  From 0-6 miles the only reciprocal access relates to vessels from Northern Ireland, which has been subject to a recent Supreme Court judgement.  It is not known, at this time, how all of this could be effected by Brexit.</p>  <p>  In that overall context, there has been regular engagement at official level with the UK and I will be discussing fisheries with the UK Secretary of Sate, Andrea Leadsom tomorrow in London.  Of course, it is important to note that no negotiations can take place until such time as the UK invokes Article 50.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with its agencies and stakeholders, has been considering all of the potential impacts, looking at the areas where the greatest risks will arise and on which we will need to focus when the negotiations begin.  Ensuring that our fishing interests are reflected in the overall EU negotiating position will be a key priority.</p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations. </p></reply>

The levels of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and the quotas for Ireland will, as usual, be determined at the Council meeting, held on 12 and 13 December.  This will involve intensive negotiations with Member States and the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  The process of preparing for the Council is well under way with my Department and Marine Agencies examining the current proposals on the key stocks of interest to Ireland.  In order to inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, a Sustainability Impact Assessment of the Commission proposal is currently being undertaken.</p>  <p>  To facilitate and inform this assessment, a public consultation process was initiated, whereby all stakeholders were asked to submit their views on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2017.  From November 2 to 25, an online web portal on www.fishingnet.ie  was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have convened a meeting of stakeholders on December 2 which will give interested parties a further opportunity to outline their positions directly to me on the many aspects of this proposal. </p>  <p>  Without pre-empting the SIA analysis, it is fair to say that I have significant concerns about some of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for demersal species of concern to Ireland as they stand.  For example, there is a cut of 68% proposed for Celtic Sea cod, a cut of 9% for our vital prawn fishery and a cut of 28% for megrims to mention just a few.  </p>  <p>  I will not support cuts where reliable scientifically vetted additional information is available to inform the decision or where there is a real risk that the proposal would lead to increased discarding of fish.  There is a high cost from a social and economic perspective when quota cuts are proposed and we have to be satisfied that in every case these cuts are justifiable.  Fishing ports and communities all around our coast are dependent on fisheries for their very survival.  </p>  <p>  The impact assessment will be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on Tuesday 6th December 2016 for further scrutiny of the Commission Proposals in advance of the December Council.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding such robust preparation, I do not underestimate the challenge facing me at this very important Council.

Among these is the question of how the EU budget will be affected by the loss of the UK contribution. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the loss to the EU budget will be of the order of between 5% and 10%.  This could have implications for future spending decisions in what is already a very tight budgetary framework.  Given that the CAP accounts for some 37% of the EU budget, we could expect additional pressure for further contraction in CAP funding in the years ahead, with potential knock-on effects on both basic payment scheme and rural development expenditure.  However, no impact is foreseen in respect of the CAP in the current multiannual financial framework until 2020.</p>  <p>  The debate is likely to be framed by the question of whether the contributions of the 27 remaining Member States to the budget in the future would have to be increased in order to ensure that the level of expenditure across all headings is maintained, or whether expenditure would have to be reduced.  The balance to be struck is likely to be the subject of difficult and protracted negotiations, which will also be linked to the related issue of the negotiations on the post-2020 EU budget, in respect of which a Commission proposal is expected in 2018. </p>  <p>  It is still too early to speculate on the likely outcome, and we must also bear in mind that much will depend on the progress of the exit negotiations between the EU and the UK, which may not commence for some time yet. </p>  <p>  I will of course continue to ensure that agriculture&rsquo;s voice is a strong one and is fully taken into account during these negotiations, based on the principle that the CAP makes an important contribution to the achievement of EU priorities in the area of jobs and growth, and should continue to attract the commensurate funding to ensure that this is maintained.</p></reply>

This sector is a very important area of the agricultural economy but it has been a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.</p>  <p>  The Deputy already raised a similar matter in the D&aacute;il last week and my Department, colleague Minister of State Doyle addressed the issue.  Indeed we have both been working on this matter at EU level.  At Agriculture Council I have repeatedly called for the situation on agricultural markets to be kept under ongoing review, and have said that we should be ready to deploy support measures if the circumstances require it.  At the October Council Minister of State Doyle followed this up with a specific request that market support efforts be extended to the cereals sector. </p>  <p>  In this connection, I know the Deputy is aware that I recently chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector.  As I said at the time and I wish to repeat here again in the House, this meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.</p>  <p>  At that meeting, I outlined that one of my chief priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme.  </p>  <p>  This financial instrument has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25m from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of  &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000.  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements. </p>  <p>  This is a cash flow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs.  The loans are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts. </p>  <p>  I also recently announced the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme, which will be operational as early as possible in 2017.</p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This will be available immediately, for this year&rsquo;s tax liability, and this will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns. </p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made this year in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.  Advance payments commenced on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations.  Up to last week, &euro;791.7 million has been paid out to 120,224 farmers and payments are ongoing. </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  My Department will also be opening a TAMS Schemes specifically for the Tillage Sector.</p>  <p>  I also stressed at the recent Tillage stakeholders meeting and I want to restate my view to the House, that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry, to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.</p></reply>

Therefore producer prices in Ireland are largely determined by commodity prices on world markets, rather than by production levels within Ireland itself.  We have seen significant commodity price volatility on world markets over the last few years.  However, there are measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods.  Direct payments, estimated by Teagasc at an average of over &euro;17,000 per farm in 2015, provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector, identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector, and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  Food Wise is not just about expanding production, I believe that moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced, is an important hedge against volatility. </p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success.  I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the twelve individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025.</p>  <p>  Since taking up office, one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the sustained period of lower commodity prices on farmers.  I met with a range of stakeholders in advance of the recent Budget and I have been engaged, both at National and EU level, to address the issues involved and to ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and resilient sector.  As part of the recent Budget, I announced a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; to alleviate the pressures of income volatility through:</p>  <p>- Lower Cost Finance: I announced plans for an &lsquo;Agri Cashflow Support Loan&rsquo; fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans at an interest rate of 2.95%, for amounts up to &euro;150,000 and for terms up to six years.</p>  <p>- Tax Measures: I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, allowing for an opt-out in an exceptional year. </p>  <p>- Farm Payments: Spending on farm schemes through the Rural Development Programme will see &euro;601 million go directly to farmers in 2017, including a new &euro;25 million sheep welfare scheme and increased participation in GLAS, BDGP &amp;amp; TAMS.  This is on top of &euro;1.2 billion paid through the Basic Payments Scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agri-taxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility.</p></reply>

Its report was published in November and its contents and recommendations deserve careful consideration.  The relatively weak position of farmers across the European Union in the supply chain is generally acknowledged.The issue is an international one, and is not easy to resolve.  It was important that it be given consideration at European Union level, because any solutions will be most effective if adopted at that level.  For this reason I very much  welcome the publication of this report, which will be discussed at the Council of Ministers  in December and there will also be further consideration of the report in early 2017.</p><p>The report includes a range of recommendations, including in relation to increased price transparency, better risk management, the regulation of unfair trading practices, greater use of contracts, greater clarity around the application of competition law to producer groups, and a shift in post 2020 CAP direct payment supports towards risk management type instruments.  The devil of any proposals emerging will be in the detail, and some of the recommendations could have quite profound effects on public policy which would need further elaboration before they can be properly considered. </p><p>The Task Force<font color="#1F497D"> </font>report also recommends mandatory price reporting for the meat industry.  Ireland already reports beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultry prices on a weekly basis, and my Department publishes a high volume of statistical data in these areas to its website in a clear and concise  format.  The data further up the supply chain is not as transparent.  In order to strengthen the position of farmers in the supply chain, I have signed legislation for the recognition of Producer Organisations in the beef sector into law earlier this year.  This will allow groups of farmers to come together to negotiate directly with factories.  An application for approval of funding for the provision of advice to Producer Organisations and prospective Producer Organisations under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme has been made to the European Commission and my Department is currently awaiting a decision on this application as part of Ireland&rsquo;s second RDP amendment.  We strongly support the use of contracts overall particularly for winter finishers although it is not clear that a mandatory regime would necessarily be in the best interest of all farmers</p><p>In conclusion the issues raised by the Task Force are of utmost importance and provide a serious basis for serious discussion on a matter which is of profound importance for farmers across the EU.  My Department will work closely with The European Commission, Member States and stakeholders across the beef and Sheepmeat sectors on any further proposals emerging from its work.</p></reply>

It is clear that driving the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU reinforces the need to develop as many outlets for our agri-food exports as possible, in order to minimise our dependence on any one market.

I believe that these activities will prove very valuable in developing the rapidly growing Asian markets as important export destinations for the Irish agri-food sector.  I also led a trade mission to Morocco and Algeria earlier this month.  Inward and outward trade visits will play a key role in our efforts to provide as many markets as possible for Irish agri-food products.</p></reply>

The potential impacts are being given the highest priority by my Department and its agencies, and by the Government as a whole.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been engaged for quite some time in a wide consultation process with industry representatives, and is continuing to deepen its analysis of the implications of the exit vote.  However, it is important to bear in mind that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiations that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure are completed.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the matter of tariffs and trade - including in relation to the trade of live animals between Ireland and the UK - is one that has been clearly identified by my Department as one of the most significant issues we face, and is therefore the subject of ongoing analysis.  </p>  <p>  There are significant levels of live export trade between Ireland and the UK, and with Northern Ireland in particular.  For example, of the 64,000 live cattle exported to the UK in 2015, 55,000 went to Northern Ireland.  In addition, a significant component of the sheep and lambs slaughtered in Irish processing facilities is of Northern Irish origin, and approximately 10,000 pigs per week produced in Ireland are sent to processing facilities in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I and my Department are therefore acutely aware of the need to ensure that our unique sensitivities in this area are adequately reflected in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, I have been working closely with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Michelle McIlveen, whom I have met on a number of occasions to discuss these issues, most recently at the North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting in Armagh on 18 November.  This close contact at political level is complemented by close cooperation between officials from our two Departments.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the all-island dialogue with civic society, which began with a very valuable conference in Dublin earlier this month, will be followed by similar events on a sectoral basis over the coming months, including an agri-food dialogue on 15 December, arrangements for which are currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  Contact with our counterparts in the UK is also well under way.  Senior officials have met on a number of occasions in recent months, and I intend to meet with the UK Secretary of State, Andrea Leadsom, in London, tomorrow.</p></reply>

Its aim is to deliver environmental benefits which will protect and enhance our biodiversity and water quality and which will raise awareness of and encourage actions which mitigate the effects of climate change.  The scheme contains actions which will deliver the expected environmental dividends and is the result of widespread consultation with stakeholders and of protracted negotiations with the European Commission.</p>  <p>  GLAS is a voluntary Scheme where participants elect to carry out specific environmental commitments and in order for a verifiable benefit to be achieved the governing regulations require that those commitments must be delivered for a minimum of five years.  There is a wide range of actions to choose from in GLAS, providing the scope for farmers across all types of farming systems to submit applications and maximise their payment under the scheme.</p>  <p>  GLAS is structured along three distinct tiers, with priority entry to farmers in Tier 1 (that is those with Priority Environmental Assets  such as farmland bird habitats, commonages and high status water areas), followed by Tier 2, with Tier 3 farmers being allocated places last. </p>  <p>  The unprecedented level of applications to the Scheme is in line with forecasts by my Department but has meant that for GLAS 2, priority had to be given to Tier 1 and Tier 2 candidates, i.e. those who either manage key environmental assets like endangered birds, protected habitats or high-quality water courses, or who have committed to undertake particularly valuable environmental actions like growing feed-crops for wild birds, adopting low-impact tillage techniques or using low-emission slurry spreading methods. </p>  <p>  Farmers had been urged to present the highest standard environmental plans under GLAS 2, and to adopt actions that would promote them from Tier 3 to a higher tier, thereby significantly increasing the chance of selection.  Over 80% of applicants in this second tranche of GLAS opted to do so.  </p>  <p>  Close to 38,000 farmers are actively participating in GLAS following the first two tranches and in respect of the third tranche of GLAS (GLAS 3) selection into the Scheme will depend on the level of applications received and the overall funding available for the Scheme.  The same criteria for priority access to the Scheme as applied in previous tranches will be applied for GLAS 3. </p>  <p>  Given the strong participation to date in GLAS I would again urge farmers applying for the third tranche in consultation with their GLAS advisor to present the highest standard of environmental plan under GLAS 3 and, where possible, to adopt actions that would promote them from Tier 3 to increase their chance of selection into the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the level of participation in GLAS to date and the continued interest in the third tranche of GLAS will ensure that all of the funding allocated to the Scheme in Ireland's Rural Development Plan 2014-2020 being fully utilised.  In its first year of implementation GLAS has seen almost 38,000 farmers approved into the Scheme which is an unprecedented level of participation for an agri-environment scheme in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Task Force received presentations and submissions from a number of relevant stakeholders including the Fisheries Producer Organisations.</p>  <p>  The key outcome of the work of the Task Force is the establishment of a sector-specific Atypical Worker Permission system, which is an extension of the existing Atypical Worker Permission schemes administered by the Department of Justice and Equality (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service &ndash; INIS).</p>  <p>  The Task Force was focussed on bringing forward practical arrangements which will minimise the risks of exploitation while ensuring that reputable employers are able to recruit trained and experienced crew members.</p>  <p>  The ceiling of 500 permissions per year recommended by the Task Force ensures that the employment of local populations in coastal communities is not impacted unduly.  In order to attract and retain workers in the fishing industry, BIM offers a comprehensive range of training courses for new entrants, existing practitioners and those seeking to diversify into a career in the marine/maritime economy.  In addition, BIM offers refresher and revalidation training for practising fishers looking to improve their skills and enhance their employment potential.</p>  <p>  Since its launch in February 2016, 193 contracts have been recorded by the Central Depository which is hosted by my Department to ensure that the ceiling of 500 contracts is not exceeded.

The Commission has sole responsibility in regard to these decisions and the State had no involvement in the adjudication process.</p>  <p>  Between 1 November 2001 and 14 December 2001, certain vessel owners submitted applications for increases in capacity for their fishing vessels on grounds of safety improvements, in accordance with Article 4(2) of Council Decision 413/97.  My Department, by letter of 14 December 2001, submitted the application to the Commission to increase the capacity of the Polyvalent and RSW Pelagic segments in accordance with the applications.  Adjudication on the applications was solely the responsibility of the EU Commission and the Irish authorities had no role.  </p>  <p>  The Commission refused 44 out of a total of 49 applications.  Since then the vessel owners have taken the EU Commission, in a series of actions, to the European Court.  In summary, this involved a number of the vessel owners, whose requests were rejected, successfully challenging the Commission&rsquo;s Decision in the European Court.  The vessel owners concerned requested the Commission to adopt a new decision complying with the criteria in the judgement.  The Commission issued new decisions again refusing the applications.  These decisions were again successfully appealed to the European court by the vessel owners.</p>  <p>  The responsibility for these safety tonnage decisions lay entirely with the Commission.  The Department or the State did not have any role in those decisions.  My understanding is that the EU Commission must decide on how to proceed in light of the decisions of the European Court which have been in favour of the vessel owners.  The owners will, I assume, maintain pressure on the Commission for a speedy response in light of the lengthy period since the applications were first made back in 2001.  At this stage I do not consider that there is a role for the Irish authorities as the matters between the Commission and the vessel owners have not been finalised.</p></reply>

The background to this issue is arrangements which have long been in existence to provide access for fishing.  </p>  <p>  The London Fisheries Convention 1964 allowed that each Coastal State could assert exclusive fishing rights within 6 nautical miles from its baselines under Article 2.  It also provided for contracting parties to allow those fishermen from another coastal state who had habitually fished within that belt to continue to do so by reason of Voisinage arrangements under Article 9.  On this basis, pre-existing reciprocal arrangements were re-affirmed at the time by means of an exchange of letters in the 1960s between the UK/Northern Ireland and Ireland which allowed for vessels from Northern Ireland to fish within Ireland&rsquo;s 6 nautical mile zone and vice versa.  The Common Fisheries Policy provides for the continuation of such neighbourhood arrangements, specifically within Article 5 of Regulation 1380/2013.  </p>  <p>  In light of the Supreme Court judgment, fishing by Northern Ireland vessels in Irish territorial waters is not currently provided for in domestic law.  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing vessels in the 0-6 nautical mile zone relying on the Voisinage Arrangements; fishing activities which have a legal basis, reliant on access arrangements to Ireland&rsquo;s 6-12 nautical mile zone in the EU Regulation 1380/2013, are not affected.  </p>  <p>  I have notified the matter to the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Michelle McIlveen MLA and I am keeping Minister McIlveen appraised of developments as appropriate.  My department is remaining in close contact with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland on the issue.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision in domestic law for them.  The Government has been notified of the development and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office is examining the Supreme Court judgment.  It is my intention to bring a proposal to Government to prepare a legislative amendment to address the issues raised by the judgment and preparations are underway in my department for this.</p></reply>

The Court in question is the Circuit Court or the High Court due to the jurisdictional provisions set out in section 47 and the welfare of parties to the proceedings usually relates to a child or children of such relationships.</p><p>The qualifications of the expert are determined by the issues of concern in the families in question.  There are no regulations that require experts to hold specific qualifications but the people engaged in this process are usually qualified and practising psychologists or psychiatrists, depending on the issues involved.  The experts appointed under section 47 are required to act in accordance with the standards and codes of conduct of their professional bodies.  A right does not exist to request a second opinion following the issuing of a section 47 report.  The process of appointing experts under section 47 is such that the identity of the expert required is usually agreed by the parties before coming to court.  In the event of a disagreement, the Court will decide on the expert.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contains new provisions regarding the best interests of children which have been in operation since 18 January 2016.  One of the Act&rsquo;s important reforms is to facilitate the hearing of the voice of the child in any court proceedings where the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  Section 63 of the Act inserted a new section 32 into the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 which provides the court with the option to seek a written expert report on the welfare of the child.  The new section 32 also enables the court to appoint an expert to determine and convey the child&rsquo;s views to the court, so that the child&rsquo;s voice can be heard in the proceedings.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>These provisions allow the courts to take account of the evolving capacity of children, and give them the flexibility to ensure that all children&rsquo;s views can be heard.  My Department is currently finalising regulations under the Act which will provide further clarity on matters relating to the appointment of child views experts.</p></reply>

It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year.</p><p>The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy.  In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society.  This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition.  The key point is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced.  Such a symbolic gesture &ndash; as the Traveller NGO paper argues &ndash; could have the potential to create a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue.</p><p>I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014).  When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue.  I will be making a presentation to the Cabinet Committee on this matter shortly and<font color="#FF0000"> </font>my officials and I are currently working to advance this issue.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review and I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>   I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that the area concerned is patrolled by Gardai assigned to Tallaght Garda Station which is part of the Tallaght Garda District.  I am informed that on 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 241 Garda&iacute; assigned to Tallaght Garda District,19 of which were Community Garda&iacute;. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  It is expected that Community Policing and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream.</p></reply>

The proposed amendment to this section does not abolish the dwelling house exemption in full but will act to deny the exemption in circumstances that are not in line with the original policy objective of the exemption.  That policy objective remains to alleviate hardship and in particular to ensure that it should not be necessary for members of a family who resided together over an extended period to have to dispose of the family home in order to meet a capital acquisitions tax liability.  I would like to assure the Deputy that my amendment will ensure that this continues to be the positon.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendment will have two effects.  Firstly, the dwelling house exemption will only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it will no longer be possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception will be where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. </p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person's principal private residence at the date of his or her death.  This requirement will be relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  In relation to an inability to pay any capital acquisitions tax that may be due, I have been advised by Revenue that a person who inherits a dwelling house but who does not qualify for the exemption is entitled to pay any tax due by instalments over a period of five years, subject to interest.  Revenue also have the discretion to allow payment over a longer period, to delay payment and to waive the interest charges in cases of genuine hardship.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>-  63% of students to attend mainstream schools </p><p>-  23% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and </p><p>-  14% to attend special schools.</p><p>The Deputy will also be that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  Special classes are part of a continuum of educational provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools. </p><p>Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  Special classes for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 Ss for a class of 6 children.</p><p>Enrolment in a special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports.</p><p>Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.</p><p>The NCSE continues to engage with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are 1,153 special classes available, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548. </p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6<sup>th</sup>July 2016.  The Bill contains a provision which will empower the NCSE to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs). </p><p>In line with recommendations from the NCSE in policy advices provided in 2011, it is the policy of the Department to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, the Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. reconfigure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved or recommended by the NCSE.  </p><p>The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.  These guidelines are available to download from<i></i><i>. </i></p><p>With regard to County Kildare, the NCSE has advised that there are 942 students with ASD attending schools in the county.  Of these 520 students attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and S support. 322 students are attending ASD special classes, including early intervention classes.  A further 100 students with ASD are placed in special schools.</p><p>I understand from the NCSE that the school referred to by the Deputy, has expressed an interest in opening a special class. </p><p>The NCSE have informed my Department that they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements available in existing classes to meet demand in the area. </p><p>I am further advised that the NCSE wrote to the school's management in July 2016 outlining the position regarding special class placements in the area and indicated that the NCSE would contact the school in the future should the position change.</p></reply>

The provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts are being applied to all other teachers in those sectors.</p>  <p>  As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal industrial relations practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  There are sound reasons for this approach.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement is a collective agreement between the Government and the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It applies to members of affiliate unions. Allowing for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis would not be consistent with the collective approach taken to public service pay agreements to date.  In addition, it could also give rise to issues around the negotiation of change and industrial relations agreements on an individual basis with every public servant.  It would also give rise to the converse question of whether individual union members would be allowed to opt out of agreements reached by their union. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, there are no proposals at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.</p></reply>

The actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including identity based bullying such as homophobic and transphobic bullying, are addressed. </p><p>As part of the implementation of the Plan, new Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools were published in September 2013.  The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  The procedures require that a school&rsquo;s written anti-bullying policy must explicitly deal with identity-based bullying including, in particular, homophobic and transphobic bullying. Harassment related to any of the nine discriminatory grounds set out in equality legislation, of which gender including transgender is one, is legally prohibited in schools and colleges in Ireland.  The Anti-Bullying Procedures require schools to confirm in their anti-bullying policy that the school will, in accordance with its obligations under equality legislation, take all such steps that are reasonably practicable to prevent the sexual harassment of pupils or staff.  Such prohibitions apply to all aspects of a school or institution&rsquo;s life, including class time, sports activities or tours and include anyone who visits the school or college.  </p><p>A number of anti-bullying initiatives that focus on homophobic and transphobic bullying are also being supported through the Action Plan.  For example, &ldquo;Being LGBT in School&rdquo; A Resource for Post-Primary Schools to Prevent homophobic and Transphobic Bullying and Support LGBT Students was developed by the Gay and Lesbian Network Equality (GLEN) with the support of my Department.  The resource aims to help schools in addressing homophobic and transphobic bullying and supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.  It includes a section addressing the specific support needs of students who identify as transgender.  In addition, the Department has provided funding and other support for the Stand Up! Against Homophobic and Transphobic bullying campaign, organised by BeLong To. </p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team have developed a number of resources in the area of Relationship and Sexuality Education.  The resources include guidance for teachers, schools and guidance counsellors on their role in supporting LGBT students.  These resources have been developed in conjunction with representative groups and are available at .  Support is also available for schools through the HSE.  Further details are available at <i>.</i></p><p>In October 2015 my Department hosted a roundtable discussion on transgender children in schools.  The roundtable provided an opportunity for the exchange of information and perspectives on the possible impact of the Gender Recognition Act 2015 on schools.  Attendance at the event included representatives of the education partners, Government Departments, agencies and NGOs.  The discussions were wide-ranging and covered many aspects of school life.</p><p>There are also a range of supports and services available to transgender students in universities and institutes of technology.  Most higher education institutions (HEIs) have LGBT societies which advocate on behalf of LGBT students and which receive funding directly from the HEI concerned.  The students unions of each HEI also have Student Welfare Officers who can provide advice and support to all students, including LGBT students.  Many students unions also have dedicated LGBT officers.  Similarly, HEIs also have Student Support and Development Services in place which, while providing service to the general student population, can also provide specific supports to transgender students.</p></reply>

The overall approach is to shift away from concentrating on reacting to problems only after they have given rise to grievances (the narrow position covered in the existing Section 28). Instead the emphasis is on improving the day-to-day experience students and their parents can expect from schools.  This can be done by setting out in law the principles that schools must apply in their engagement with students and parents.</p><p>The legislation will provide the statutory basis for ministerial guidelines which will form the framework for a Parents&rsquo; and Students&rsquo; Charter in every school following consultation with parents, students, recognised school management bodies and staff associations representing teachers and other appropriate bodies.</p><p>I plan to make an announcement shortly on the draft legislation.

The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned.</p><p>Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which passed Second Stage on the 17<sup>th</sup>November 2016, includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.</p><p>I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p></reply>

The project was included in the five year construction programme 2012-16 and was scheduled therein to commence construction in 2014. </p>  <p>  Planning permission was granted in January 2014. Since then the Board of Management and its design team have presented a number of proposals to the Department to change the brief to one which involves a single decant and a single phased delivery during construction.  This has led to significant delays in the progression of the project.  The most recent decant option, which included the provision of significant levels of new temporary accommodation on site involved an additional cost for the project in the region of &euro;2 million &ndash; an increase in the overall cost of the project of around 40%.</p>  <p>  The additional &euro;2 million cost for the project arising from the Board of Managements single phase decant and construction proposal raised serious questions as to the viability of the project.</p>  <p>  A meeting was convened by my Department recently, to which the Board of Management and their Design Team were invited in order to resolve any outstanding issues in this regard to enable Stage 2b to be finalised.  </p>  <p>  That meeting was held on the 11th November and agreement was reached in relation to a scaling back of the temporary accommodation costs which should now allow the project to progress to the completion of the design stages.</p></reply>

It is a matter for individual schools to determine which of these resources they choose to access.

The Strategy remains in force and as a result of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, its statutory role and influence has been strengthened by new requirements for local authority and regional plans to align with the NSS.  Bearing in mind the elapse of time as well as the changed circumstances and new challenges that have emerged in the planning arena since the NSS was adopted, work is underway on the preparation of a successor to the NSS, the National Planning Framework, for which a roadmap on its preparation is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:.</p><p>Consultation is a critical element in the design, transparency and delivery of the National Planning Framework.  Successful preliminary consultation with key stakeholders was undertaken in June 2016.  A national public consultation strategy is currently being devised to run in early 2017.</p><p>The National Planning Framework will act as the strategic planning context for relevant Government policies and investment in housing, water services, transport, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure, as well as the preparation by the three new Regional Assemblies of their new regional spatial and economic strategies, and for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In this context, I am consulting with colleagues in other Departments and agencies in order to inform the National Planning Framework, in recognition of the whole-of-Government approach and the challenges and opportunities that exist to better align place making, investment priorities, employment and environmental strategies.</p><p>It is intended that an emerging draft National Planning Framework will be prepared by the first half of 2017 for submission to the Oireachtas for approval.  It would be inappropriate at this early stage to comment on the likely content of the Framework, until sufficient preparatory and consultative work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

Under the legislation, Irish Water now has the powers previously held by local authorities in relation to the takeover of Group Water Schemes.  This means that Irish Water may acquire by agreement a waterworks or waste water works, subject generally to not fewer than two thirds of those entitled to dispose of it (typically the members of a group water scheme), giving their consent.</p><p>It is open, therefore, to group water schemes to contact Irish Water if they wish to have their schemes considered for take over. </p><p>During 2015, my Department established a working group involving key stakeholders in the rural water sector to address the development of the sector within the overall water reform programme to ensure that the programme responds effectively to current and future needs.  Local authorities, the Water Services Transition Office, Irish Water, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and my Department are represented on the working group.  One of the tasks of the group is to ensure that there is appropriate integration of the Department's Rural Water Programme and Irish Water's Capital Investment Programme so as to fully support rural development and address any environmental issues that may arise.</p><p>The working group is also considering a number of areas where there are potential boundary issues with Irish Water or legacy issues which need to be addressed and new approaches in this area will be informed by a number of demonstration projects or pilot schemes.  A number of pilot projects relating to the takeover of group water schemes have been undertaken as pathfinders to identify and standardise the processes and documentation required at each step of the taking in charge process.</p><p>The information and experience gained has fed into an overall governance framework which is to be utilised by Irish Water and relevant local authorities on all future schemes to be taken in charge. </p><p>In January 2016, my Department wrote to local authorities advising them of a new multi-annual approach to the funding of group water schemes for 2016 and beyond under the Rural Water Programme.

Entitlement is based on 520 PRSI contributions having being paid since first starting work and the rate payable is based on the average yearly number of PRSI contributions made over a working life.  A person who does not qualify for the full rate of SPC would generally qualify for a reduced rate of payment of SPC.  It should be noted that people with a yearly average number of PRSI contribution of 40 or more will qualify for a weekly rate of SPC which is in excess of the weekly maximum rate of the equivalent social assistance payment &ndash; the State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC).</p>  <p>  The latter payment is one of a range of means tested social assistance payments.  The means test takes account of the income and assets of the person and any spouse/partner, if applicable.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments. </p>  <p>  For the State Pension Non-Contributory, the means of the claimant are taken to be one-half of the means of the couple.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the means test is to ensure those individuals and couples with limited or no income or assets receive the most support from the State, while those with higher levels of income or assets provide for their own needs to a greater extent.  It is in the nature of means tested schemes that there is no entitlement to a payment once the means of an individual or couple exceed a given amount.  Finally, where one of a couple is entitled to a SPC, an increase may be payable in respect of a spouse or partner who has income of less than &euro;310 per week.  Any such increase is paid directly to the spouse or partner.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded based on the average yearly contributions made during a working life.  Those with a yearly average of 48+ contributions receive a 100% pension, where, for example, those with only a yearly average of 20 contributions receive an 85% pension (not means-tested).  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits, and was not back-dated for periods of homemaking prior to its introduction.</p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;222 (95% of the maximum contributory pension).   </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  Following examination of the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment introduced in September 2012, the Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. </p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of next year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, have been contracted to deliver the service.  These companies have established over 80 service locations around the country and employ nearly 600 staff.  Over 60,000 jobseekers have commenced their engagement with the JobPath companies. </p>  <p>  The service is being delivered through a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies i.e. the model is so structured that the contractors cannot recover their costs or make a profit unless they successfully place jobseekers into full time, paid and sustainable employment.  Contractors are paid via a combination of an initial registration fee and thereafter job sustainment fees which are paid in respect of 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks of sustained employment of at least 30 hours per week.  </p>  <p>  The overall cost of the service will be determined by the number of people who engage with the service and the number of jobseekers who successfully obtain and sustain employment. It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.  </p>  <p>  Both companies are subject to regular on-site inspections to ensure that the service is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations.  My department has also commissioned a customer satisfaction survey to independently assess whether customers who are referred to the service are satisfied with the level, and quality, of service delivered by the contractors.  The results of the survey are expected in the coming weeks.  Payments to contractors can be reduced if the results of the survey or of the inspections indicate that the quality of service is not satisfactory.</p>  <p>  Given that the engagement period on JobPath is 12 months and also that rollout was phased it will take time to accumulate a sufficient number of completed engagements to support a robust impact evaluation.  Nevertheless the department intends to carry out a preliminary econometric counterfactual impact evaluation of JobPath over the coming months, this work is expected to be completed in mid-2017 and will be followed in early 2018 by an independent third party evaluation.  In addition, my department has agreed to facilitate the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed (INOU) to conduct an external review of client experience with JobPath.  This is expected to be undertaken early next year.  </p>  <p>  The JobPath service commenced in 2015 and the contracts are for six years comprising two consecutive phases: phase one entails four years&rsquo; of client referrals while phase two entails a &lsquo;run off&rsquo; period during which time no additional clients will be referred, but services will be delivered to completion for those clients referred during phase one.  The contracts include options to extend phase one for further periods (up to a maximum of 24 months) at the Department&rsquo;s discretion.  Any decision to do so will be taken nearer to the time.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that payments in 2016 to JobPath providers will amount c. &euro;25m.</p></reply>

The draft scheme is currently subject to detailed legal considerations and the intention is to bring forward Regulations on the new scheme as soon as these legal considerations have been settled.</p></reply>

Consequently, expenditure by the IOTs impacts on the General Government Balance and borrowing by the IOTs contribute to the General Government Debt.  Essentially, as borrowings are spent, they impact on the General Government Balance in the same way as applies with direct Exchequer funding of the IOTs. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education raised the issue of a borrowing framework for IOTs in the context of the provision of student accommodation.  Officials in my Department and in the Department of Education and Skills are currently exploring options for a borrowing framework or equivalent arrangement that would facilitate investment in student accommodation for IOTs but would not impact on the General Government balance.  </p></reply>

They can be found throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  There is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to 28 February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as the National Parks.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p><p>Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners, who may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p><p>With regard to calls for increased fencing in relation to incidents of deer presence on public roads, my Department has no plans to fence the National Parks. Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and it is not part of the remit of my Department, nor indeed would it be generally possible, to cordon them onto specific areas of land.  Moreover, fencing the National Parks would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results or serve any practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management.</p><p>With regard to the incident referred to, I am advised that it was not fully established that the cause was attributable to deer.  Nevertheless, as previously indicated, my Department is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (and possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists to be vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected.  Officials from my Department have discussed this approach with the relevant County Council and I understand that it has prepared a scheme of works, which includes a number of measures such as the trimming back of overhanging tree branches and enhancement/relocation of roadside signs.</p><p>In relation to deer policy in general, my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, published <i>Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action</i>in 2015, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish Deer Management Forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the Report.  The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, as well as representatives from both Departments.</p></reply>

In the last number of months, I have introduced a number of schemes which will support the development of towns and villages all over Ireland.</p><p>In August, I launched a new Town and Village Renewal Scheme which has allocated funding of almost &euro;10 million to 172 towns and villages across the country to make them more attractive and sustainable places in which to live and work.  I have secured funding of &euro;12 million for an enhanced Town and Village Renewal Scheme next year and as part of this, I intend to pilot an initiative to encourage more people to reside in town and village centres.</p><p>I have also recently approved &euro;5.3 million for 41 projects across Ireland under the Rural Economic Development Zone (REDZ) initiative.  The REDZ programme will complement the Town and Village Renewal Scheme by supporting projects that create economic opportunity between towns and their rural environs.  </p><p>The CL&Aacute;R Programme, which was reopened in October with initial funding of &euro;3 million available for this year, will also support rural towns and villages.  This programme provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population.  This year, CL&Aacute;R will provide funding for three measures: Safety Measures for Schools and Community/Sports Facilities, Playgrounds and Multi-Use Games Areas, and Local Access Roads.  The projects approved for funding will be announced imminently. </p></reply>

The Report of the Review was published in July 2015 and included a general examination of the operation of the Scheme as well as the balance between residential care and care in the community.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.  </p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group was set up to progress the recommendations contained in the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  Significant progress has already been made in relation to the implementation of recommendations relating to the administrative reforms to the Scheme.  An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.  </p>  <p>  A Review by the National Treatment Purchase Fund of the system for setting prices in private and voluntary nursing homes is well advanced and is expected to be completed in the coming months. </p>  <p>  As of now there are no plans to formally publish a consolidated implementation report covering all of the issues identified in the NHSS Review, but full information will nonetheless be available to the Deputy on request regarding any relevant issue.  </p>  <p>  Any significant changes deemed necessary to the Scheme will require legislation and will accordingly be addressed together at the conclusion of the implementation process.</p></reply>

In that regard, monthly payments of &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.

The review was undertaken by Dr. Niall Herity, a highly respected, Belfast based NHS cardiologist.  </p>  <p>  Dr. Herity has made clear recommendations that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified.  However, he recommends investing in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology services, including increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided, in order to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  He also recommends that new specialist equipment be provided to improve contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure.  I am happy to provide the additional resources necessary to implement these recommendations, the detail of which will be set out in the HSE National Service Plan 2017 which will be published this month. </p>  <p>  I have asked that the situation be closely monitored during this period of investment and enhancement of services, so that we will be in a position to assess the impact of the improvements on the volume of patients attending the Waterford cath lab.</p>  <p>   Dr. Herity also recommends that some services be provided elsewhere. I want to be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services, with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access on a 24/7 basis, to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack. I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p><p>1.  the health needs of the public; </p><p>2.  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3.  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p><p>4.  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5.  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6.  the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7.  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8.  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9.  the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.  This assessment is still on-going.  Once the assessment is completed, a summary report will be published on the NCPE website. </p><p>The HSE will then consider the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement.  This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In relation to compassionate access schemes, I have previously asked manufacturers to show compassion and to maintain access compassionate access schemes for patients during the assessment process by the HSE and this remains the position.  However, the operation of compassionate access schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.</p></reply>

However, it is open for an Irish registered doctor to apply for a licence for such preparations for an individual, named-patient.  Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis.  The appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor. </p>  <p>  Since becoming Minister for Health I have met with a number of patients and carers who believe that cannabis should be a treatment option for their medical condition. </p>  <p>  I understand the concern of these and many other people who believe that cannabis should be a treatment option for certain medical conditions and I recognise the urgency and constant worry felt by patients with very distressing illnesses.  As a result I am committed to urgently reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s policy on medicinal cannabis. </p>  <p>  I recently asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to examine the issue of permitting the use of cannabis-based products for medical purposes in Ireland.  The HPRA&rsquo;s statutory role is to protect and enhance human health by regulating medicines and other health products and it has the necessary clinical and scientific expertise to provide advice on this issue.  </p>  <p>  Separately the Oireachtas Health Committee has now also begun to examine the issue of medicinal cannabis. </p>  <p>  I hope to receive the report from the HPRA and the output from the Oireachtas Health Committee early in the New Year and I will then be in a position to consider future policy and progress any legislative changes that may be recommended.</p></reply>

The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.  In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  More recently, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population was conducted by the Health Research Board (HRB) on behalf of the Department.  This review was published by the HRB in June 2015.  The HRB found no definitive evidence that community water fluoridation is associated with negative health effects.  A research project "Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth" (FACCT) is being conducted by UCC and supported by the HSE.  Preliminary results indicate that children's oral health has been improving, fluoridated communities have lower levels of dental caries. </p>  <p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, is a safe and effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  </p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to protect public health by bringing certain substances which are open to misuse and known to be traded on the illicit market under the scope of the Misuse of Drugs legislation, thereby aiding the law enforcement activities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These include so-called z-drugs - zopiclone and zaleplon.  </p>  <p>  The Act also controls the benzodiazepine phenazepam and a number of new psychoactive substances which Ireland is required to control under our EU and UN obligations, as well as two substances found in the headshop drug &lsquo;Clockwork Orange&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  Controlling the substances in the Act was part one of a two-step process. Regulations and various Orders are also required to allow legitimate users (e.g. patients with a prescription, health professionals) to possess the substances.  Four associated SIs are required to be made concurrently.  Drafting of these Regulations and Orders is complex and technical in nature, involving significant consultation with State Agencies, but is at an advanced stage.  Various sections of the Act will be commenced when the associated regulations are ready and this should happen in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

According to Bord Bia, overall meat exports increased by &euro;140 million to &euro;3.5 billion. </p>  <p>  Although exports to the UK and EU account for the majority of meat exports, I am very conscious of the importance of growing international markets as a valuable outlet for Irish beef, lamb and pigmeat production and very significant progress has been made in this context in recent years.  Indeed this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 Strategy, given the changing global demographics and emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere, and has been given an added impetus by the outcome of the UK referendum on Brexit.  </p>  <p>  While the results of the UK referendum pose a challenge, my Department and our agencies, in association with our stakeholders, have been giving careful consideration to the potential impacts of a UK exit, looking at the areas in which the greatest risks are likely to arise and on which we will need to focus when exit negotiations begin.  As part of our overall contingency planning, the Department has established a dedicated unit to work on these issues and has convened a consultative committee of stakeholders to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation with 90% of our food produce leaving the island. In this context Minister Doyle and I lead a very successful Trade Mission to China, Vietnam, South Korea and Singapore in September.  This Mission resulted in positive progress in relation to the next steps in terms of gaining beef market access to China, South Korea and Vietnam, including inter alia a commitment by Chinese officials in AQSIQ to expedite consideration of a technical inspection report from their visit to Ireland earlier this year as well as the submission of detailed beef questionnaires to the relevant authorities in South Korea and Vietnam.   </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I led a Trade Mission to Morocco and my officials also travelled to Algeria, with a focus on live cattle exports.  Live cattle exports to Turkey also commenced in September following our recent approval to export live cattle there.  It is only through further increasing our footprint internationally that we will help to mitigate the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential.</p>  <p>  Planning for Trade Missions during 2017 has now commenced and market access will be a key component of any such missions.  Furthermore, my Department is currently in the process of reviewing its approach to market access and the resources allocated therein in accordance with new and emerging challenges and priorities, such as Brexit.  The search for new markets will continue in conjunction with the industry and various stakeholders.</p></reply>

It is important to remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiations that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure are completed.</p>  <p>  While the UK market is of great importance to our agri-food sector, it is important that we continue to diversify and seek growth opportunities into other markets in order to minimise our dependence on any one market.  My Department's Food Wise 2025 strategy places significant emphasis on market development and we have been very active in our efforts to expand into new and emerging markets in recent years.</p>  <p>  In particular, responding to consumer demands in emerging markets such as Asia and North Africa are seen as important export destinations for the Irish agri-food sector.  In this regard, I led a very successful trade mission to China and Singapore in September, while my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle led a Trade Mission to Vietnam and South Korea, also in September.  More recently, I led a trade mission to Morocco and Algeria in early November.</p>  <p>  Of course in tandem with these efforts we are also seeking to expand to markets throughout the European Union.  Both Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland play a crucial role in developing as many markets as possible for our agri-food products.  I and my Department will continue to be supportive of their efforts in this regard.</p></reply>

Total seafood exports have increased in value terms by 53% since 2010.  Whilst our main EU markets (France, Spain, UK, Italy and Germany) continue to dominate our seafood exports (56% of total), our exports to international markets reached &euro;187 million in 2015 (33% of total).  </p>  <p>  Since 2010, our seafood sector, supported by Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Enterprise Ireland, has focused much effort on developing business in the emerging seafood markets in Asia.  In 2010, exports to the four main Asian markets (China, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea) accounted for 3% by value of our seafood exports.  By 2015, that figure had reached 9%.  </p>  <p>  Bord Bia plays a key role in assisting the Irish seafood sector in developing sales in a number of emerging seafood markets through its international office network.  Through the range of services provided to seafood clients in areas such as trade research, customer profiling, buyer-supplier contact events, in-store and online seafood promotions and trade awareness events, Bord Bia has been instrumental in assisting the Irish seafood sector establish a foothold in these markets in the past 5 years.  Bord Bia has recently completed a Pan Asian market attractiveness study to identify the top 5 &lsquo;high potential&rsquo; markets for Irish seafood exporters (outside of China).  Bord Bia will focus its trade and market development efforts on Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan in 2017.  This will be in addition to the China seafood development programme already in place.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme is supporting Bord Bia&rsquo;s increased seafood promotion effort through &euro;800,000 additional funding per year.  In addition, the EMFF Operational Programme is funding a suite of schemes implemented by Bord Iascaigh Mhara to support our seafood processing sector develop new value-added seafood products, put in place the capital investment to produce new and more seafood products, develop business and marketing strategies to take advantage of the export opportunities, and to work cooperatively with other seafood enterprises to develop marketing resources in potential export markets.</p></reply>

This growth in share of exports occurred during a period when total food and drink exports jumped by more than 45%.</p><p>Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with trade growing by more than 250% to &euro;955 million, and led by China, which recorded a fourfold increase.  Exports to other Asian markets more than doubled over the period to &euro;300 million.</p><p>Trade to Africa grew by more than 50% over the period to &euro;535 million.</p><p>Exports to the Middle East jumped by one third, to &euro;380 million. </p><p>Trade to Central/South America was 60% higher at &euro;91 million in 2015.</p><p>In term of product categories, the following trends were evident in emerging markets over the 2010 to 2105 period:</p><p>-  Dairy - up by 76% to &euro;1.16 billion.  This equates to one third of total dairy exports.</p><p>-  Seafood exports jumped by more than &euro;170 million to reach &euro;182 million in 2015.</p><p>-  Pigmeat exports grew by 160% to &euro;125 million.</p><p>-  Beverage exports were 17% higher at &euro;132 million in 2015</p><p>-  Prepared Food exports, led by enriched dairy based powders, grew by 42% to reach &euro;444 million</p><p>The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade.  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.</p><p>In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, Minister Doyle and I led Trade Missions to China, Vietnam, South Korea and Singapore in early September.  I also led a trade mission to Morocco in early November.  During the year senior officials also led missions to Iran, Turkey and Algeria.  All of these were undertaken in co-operation with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, and featured a wide range of participating businesses from the agri-food sector. </p></reply>

Agri food exports account for 7% of GDP and continue to grow year on year.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays a vital role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  My Department has assisted our colleagues in the Department of Health on the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat and poultry meat into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April 1st 2015.  This requires businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  The draft SI has been finalised and my Department has placed it on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States and following on from the obligatory three month standstill period I am confident that the Minister for Health will be in a position to sign the SI, thereby bringing it into force.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Authorities is to verify compliance with these requirements.  This is done by inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department. </p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance.  Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase in milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April last year.  </p>  <p>  Progress on those targets was monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The fourth annual report &ldquo;Milestones for Success 2014&rdquo;, published in September 2014, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets and illustrated the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of &lsquo;smart, green, growth&rsquo; is being attained.  The latest data available show growth of 34% and 32% for primary production and exports, respectively, versus the baseline period.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July last year, is the successor to the Food Harvest strategy. It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.  Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved. </p>  <p>  In July this year, I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.  I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.</p></reply>

The Committee has identified that opportunities will arise as a result of significant population growth and greater access to international markets.  In addition, the Committee recognises that the increased pressure on global agricultural resources and the environment will offer potential further growth opportunity for the Irish agri-food and fisheries sector.  It identifies over 400 recommendations to achieve sustainable growth and these will require a concerted and coordinated approach by primary producers, industry, Departments and State agencies.</p>  <p>  One of these actions is to develop and initiate practical and competitive measures to attract additional landings into Irish ports and continue to invest significantly in necessary infrastructure at the Fishery Harbour Centres.  In July  a tender was awarded to Poseidon Aquatic Resource Management Ltd to develop a strategic roadmap to increase access to raw material from foreign landings.  A BIM Steering Group will work with Poseidon to deliver on the proposed work plan.  Poseidon has commenced engaging with stakeholders in Ireland, France, Spain and the UK to gain perspectives on the current status, opportunities, barriers and enablers regarding foreign landings.</p>  <p>  Already work has begun for a multi phased Harbour Integrated Development Project for Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre.  The new project will almost double the length of pier space on Dinish Island to over 400 metres, as well as providing a fit for purpose Harbour Administration Building and associated works on the mainland and is a direct response to the increase in fish landings into Castletownbere since the last major development became operational in 2010.  We have seen a level of increased fishing activity that far exceeded any expectations with a 140% increase in the volume of fish landed and a 277% in the value of fish landed since between 2010 and 2015.</p>  <p>  It is expected that BREXIT will impact on the seafood sector and we will need to evaluate the implications as the situation develops and consider appropriate responses and adjustments, where appropriate, in our strategy.   </p></reply>

Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.  While the possible impact of the UK referendum on consumer sentiment remains to be seen, it is estimated that the sector may grow in value to &euro;700 million in 2016, including &euro;500 million in this jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  Artisan and speciality food businesses can have a significant impact on local economies as businesses are typically owner managed and may be closely linked to local farms.  The FoodWise 2025 strategy recognises the value of the sector and its development and employment potential.  Food Wise 2025 recommends actions to support the sector to realise its potential, including festival markets, a pipeline for new entrants to the Artisan Food Market at Bloom, promoting meet the buyer opportunities, delivery of small business specific consumer and market insights, and programmes to assist producers to extend business reach.  A number of artisan businesses have participated in successful programmes such as Food Academy (developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu and delivering growth and jobs) and Food Works (developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland for start-up food entrepreneurs).  </p>  <p>  The farmhouse cheese sector alone includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level.  My Department has supported a three year Bord Bia farmhouse cheese programme under the EU Promotion regime.  The output of farmhouse and specialty cheese could well increase to over 4,500 tonnes a year, worth c. &euro;33m without significant additional capital expenditure. </p>  <p>  In terms of small food businesses in general, close to 500 food companies with a turnover of &euro;100k-&euro;3.5m are registered with Bord Bia for supports and services.  These owner managed businesses tend to produce high-end products with a strong focus on the domestic market. </p>  <p>  In addition, over the last 5 years over 400 new companies with revenues of less than &euro;100k have entered the sector.  Through the Food Academy Start programme, these companies typically start with a standardised support package delivered by the Local Enterprise Offices nationally.  This collaborative approach ensures the skills and capabilities of early stage companies are developed through a &lsquo;learn by doing&rsquo; approach and over 300 companies have been given the opportunity to get product on the Food Academy fixture.  </p>  <p>  Although taken singly these businesses are small, cumulatively the Irish small food business sector is a critical component of and contributor to the strength of local and rural economies.  It is well recognised that entrepreneurship is the seedbed for innovation and supports such a Food Works help to embed the culture and belief in scalable start-ups through innovation. </p>  <p>  Farmers markets remain a valuable entry point for many potential food entrepreneurs and those building a local and visitor customer base.  In November Bord Bia ran a series of workshops for farmers markets &ndash; in Limerick, Cork, Galway and Wicklow.  Total attendance was 109, exceeding the Bord Bia target of 80, and included experienced market holders as well as start up and potential producers.  Feedback was very positive and Bord Bia is now considering developing a programme for market managers to support the development of this important local route to market.  </p>  <p>  For a number of years my Department has provided bursaries for the UCC Diploma in Speciality Food Production, a food science and business course for food producers, potential start-ups and those interested in developing businesses and /or promoting the artisan sector. Over 180 students have graduated, many are successfully running small artisan and speciality food businesses.  My Department will continue to fund bursaries over the next 4 years to maintain this momentum. </p></reply>

FoodWise 2025 envisages a further significant expansion in agricultural output, primarily based on animal production over the next 10 years.  It is therefore essential that all stakeholders in the livestock sector collaborate to ensure, insofar as possible, compliance with the highest animal health standards.  In view of this and of the importance I attach to animal health matters, I launched a consultation process last September on the development of a new Farmed Animal Health Strategy framework for Ireland.  A coherent and robust Strategy has the capability to deliver very significant savings per annum as has been evidenced in the case of the recent progress being made on the BVD eradication programme.  On the other hand, sub-optimal animal health impacts negatively at individual farm level, on processor returns, on the environment and ultimately on international trade and domestic employment levels.  In addition, zoonotic infections in animals as well as the avoidable use of antibiotics in animals may impact on public health.  The principle that guides the Strategy,  &lsquo;Prevention is better than Cure,&rsquo; seeks to change the focus from one of post-event response and the management of disease, to one that promotes animal health as a driver of optimised production, improved margins for producers and providing the best quality for consumers.  My Department is currently reviewing submissions received from stakeholders.</p>  <p>   I should also mention the most recent meeting of the Agriculture North South Ministerial Council in October, which provided an opportunity, together with Michelle McIlveen MLA, Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, to review progress on the All-Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy Action Plan.  In the context of Brexit, the Council agreed to the continuation of practical and effective North South co-operation on animal health and welfare, and disease control in both jurisdictions in order that the health and welfare of livestock is maintained at the highest level.</p>  <p>   At EU level, a major revamp of the European Union Animal health law (AHL) was agreed by the Council and the European Parliament in March 2016, and will be applicable from 2021.  The new AHL provides for the adoption of a single and simplified regulatory framework for animal health by putting greater focus on preventative measures, disease surveillance, controls and research in order to reduce the incidence of animal diseases and minimise the impact of outbreaks when they occur.  It sets out the basic principles of animal health including rules for movements of animals, animal products and products of animal origin and disease control and eradication measures.  It also lays down conditions for early detection and disease notification.  Some 40 existing EU directives and regulations will be superseded when the AHL is implemented.</p></reply>

The governing regulations further prescribe that where it is not possible to make an accurate determination on the eligibility of a parcel or parcels of land by means of an assessment of the available imagery, a field visit must be undertaken to verify the position on the ground.</p>  <p>  Of the 6,500 cases selected for a remote sensing (satellite) inspection across the various area-based schemes, payment of the first instalment of the BPS has issued to 5,176 applicants to date.  Payments under Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme (ANC) have issued to 3,582 applicants to date.  The balancing payment under BPS will commence issuing this Thursday 1st December and additional completed remote sensing inspection cases will have their full payment under BPS processed as part of this payment process.</p>  <p>  Priority is being given to the processing of all outstanding cases subject to a remote sensing inspection and cases continue to be finalised to payment stage on a daily basis. Regular payment runs will continue to be made for both the BPS and ANC Schemes to ensure prompt payment of fully processed cases.  </p></reply>

Council conclusions on the issue are expected to be adopted in December, and the Commission has undertaken to consider the report's recommendations in the context of its Work Programme for 2017.</p>  <p>  The report examines a range of issues such as market transparency, risk management, futures markets and trading practices, and makes a series of recommendations with a view to strengthening the position of farmers across the supply chain.  The recommendations include consideration of the introduction of an EU-wide legislative framework for unfair trading practices, the development of futures markets, increasing market transparency and the mandatory inclusion by Member States of actions promoting on-farm risk management strategies under their Rural Development Programmes.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the report by the Markets Task Force.  I believe that the prerequisite for a sustainable food supply chain is free and fair competition, accompanied by balanced relationships between all of the entities along the chain.  It is very important that all operators acknowledge their interdependence with each other.  This means that they need to work together to develop a model which sustains agricultural production, without which none of the downstream industrial or service sectors could exist.</p>  <p>  Regarding the report&rsquo;s recommendations, I believe that an EU-wide framework would represent the correct approach to dealing with unfair trading practices.  Our own experience with the new Grocery Goods Regulations, which entered into force at the end of April this year following extensive consultation, demonstrated that a voluntary regime would not have the confidence of all stakeholders.  We have also learned from our experience of agri-food legislation on safety, traceability and quality that the Single Market requires legislative frameworks to function well and freely.  </p>  <p>  However, changes to the legislative framework are unlikely to be enough.  Supply chain imbalances invariably become a focal point in periods of increased volatility.  Measures to reduce costs, improve competitiveness and support innovation will also be required in order to improve sustainability.  Efforts in this regard can be industry-led but ideally should have cross-stakeholder buy-in.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the report&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to improving market transparency.  Price monitoring is limited by the lack of availability of data and models. While producer returns at primary level are quite well publicised and retail prices are known, there is little data on the basis on which they are constructed.  The establishment of price monitoring platforms and deeper input to these platforms by Member States, as suggested in the report, is useful and is something we can support.</p>  <p>  The findings of the report are still being reviewed and consideration is now being given to the introduction of practical and sensible measures at an appropriate level.  I and my Department will engage constructively with this process.</p></reply>

This will allow ComReg to proceed to auction the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, and will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  The liberalisation of this band is in accordance with EU rules, and will allow the band to be used for a combination of mobile and wireless services, providing better quality voice and data services to customers across Ireland. </p>  <p>  I have no role or function in the delivery of the auction process, which is a matter for ComReg.

It is envisaged that this network will offer wholesale services to multiple retailers, who can in turn offer competitive and affordable and high speed broadband to users. </p>  <p>  The Plan aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015. </p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  All three bidders involved in the competitive dialogue process are proposing a predominantly fibre- to- the &ndash;home network solution to connect rural Ireland.  Wireless technology may also play a role in part of the overall solution.  It is a matter for the bidders in the process to put forward the technologies they believe are most appropriate to meet the NBP objectives.  </p></reply>

Extensive consultation has taken place with the industry since the PRI review report on Tyres and Waste Tyres was published in 2013.  In addition, I recently met with the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) and the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA) to discuss their concerns.</p><p>The issue of market distortion is a valid concern.  In this regard, distance sellers, i.e., those placing tyres on the Irish market but located outside the State, will have the same obligations as any operator based in Ireland. In addition tyres will be a priority area for enforcement in 2017 for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) and I will be asking them to give particular attention to the border regions. </p></reply>

If economic operators become aware that products on the market present a potential hazard they must take appropriate measures, up to and including recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed.  Any action taken by an operator must be notified to the relevant Market Surveillance Authority: in Ireland this is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which is statutorily independent in the carrying out of its functions.  On the specific issue of safety standards for candles, three Irish standards currently apply:</p><p>-  I.S. EN 15493 : Candles - Specification for Fire Safety</p><p>-  I.S. EN 15494 : Candles - Product Safety Labels</p><p>-  I.S. EN 15426 : Candles - specification for Sooting Behaviour</p><p>These Irish standards state that warning labels should be visible and legible. Warnings can include: </p><p>-  never leaving a burning candle unattended;</p><p>-  burning candles out of the reach of children and pets; and </p><p>-  not burning candles on or near anything that can catch fire</p><p>If candles are compliant with the requirements of the relevant Irish Standards listed above, they are deemed or presumed to be safe with regards to the requirements of S.I. No. 199 of 2004.  There are no plans for further national regulations in this area at present.</p></reply>

This Bill was required to give effect to the Government Decision of 15<sup>th</sup>November 2011 to rationalise the State&rsquo;s existing employment rights and industrial relations dispute resolution bodies.  Following on from these Government decisions the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has undertaken and completed an extensive programme of reform of the State&rsquo;s employment rights and industrial relations procedures.  The legislation which has given statutory effect to the reform programme, namely the Workplace Relations Act 2015, was enacted on 20<sup>th</sup>May, 2015. </p><p>During the preparatory stage of this legislation, the Minister engaged in extensive public consultation in framing the proposals for a radical reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services.  This process included two extensive public consultation exercises and the publication of two policy papers which helped inform the design and delivery of the reform.  The responses received from stakeholders demonstrated a strong consensus around the need for reform and the shape that reform should take.  The Policy document <i>&lsquo;Legislating for a World Class Workplace Relations Service&rsquo; </i>was submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in July, 2012 and the Minister had a constructive dialogue with the Committee in July, 2012 on the basis of the document.  </p><p>Numerous meetings also took place with interested parties, representative of employees, employers and equality interests including IBEC and ICTU to get their input into the process. </p><p>The Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides for the establishment of a new two-tier workplace relations structure to replace the previously existing five workplace relations bodies.  A new single body of first instance called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was created from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2015 and a separate appeals body, which is effectively an expanded Labour Court. </p><p>The WRC incorporates the functions of the Labour Relations Commission (including the Rights Commissioner Service), the Equality Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal (first instance jurisdiction only), and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  Three of the bodies listed above have been dis-established following the transfer of their functions to the WRC.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal will be dis-established once it has dealt with the caseload submitted to it prior to 1<sup>st</sup>October 2015.</p><p>The putting in place of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 is the most far-reaching legislative reform in the area of employment and industrial relations in almost 70 years.  The result is a more straightforward and user friendly system allowing both expert and non-expert users navigate their way around the employment and industrial relations machinery.</p></reply>
