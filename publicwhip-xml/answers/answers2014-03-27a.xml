The current role of the Committees is to assist the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in improving and expanding the quality of childcare services available to parents in their area.  The Committees offer information and guidance locally on a wide variety of services including advice on establishing a childcare business, organising childcare information sessions, and supporting parents by providing information on local facilities and parent networks. The Committees also have a significant role in the delivery of a range of childcare support programmes which are currently implemented by my Department.</p><p>  Each Committee submits an annual implementation plan which outlines its strategy for the year and the annual funding level is determined on the basis of this plan.  The implementation plan provides for a range of activities to be undertaken by the committees and identifies locally focused initiatives which are designed to address specific local needs. In 2014, a total of  just over &euro;10 million has been allocated.</p><p>  The Committees have played an important role in the development of childcare services throughout the country since their introduction in 2001.  They have worked closely with this Department and previously with the Office of the Minister of Children in co-ordinating the increase in the number of child care places in their areas.  The introduction of the additional support programmes and the expansion of the existing programmes have significantly increased the work load undertaken by the Committees.</p><p>  The Committees will continue to play a key role in the ongoing development of childcare services and will have a central role in supporting the implementation of new and emerging childcare policy developments, including in the area of quality improvements. Future developments with respect to Childcare Committee can be further considered in the context of the establishment, this year, of a new National Quality Support Service for early years and childcare services, which form a key objective of my 8 point agenda to improve quality standards in early yeas and childcare services.</p><p>  Increasingly, the Department works collectively with the Committees and also with other bodies such as the Child and Family Agency and Pobal to ensure effective delivery of services and to avoid duplication. In this context, the Committees have established a representative body, Childcare Committees Ireland to contribute to better co-ordination of the work of the Committees.  This group meets regularly with my Department and with Pobal to progress developments and ensure consistency and is a significant contributor to collaborative working in the early years sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-27a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032700012#WRA00800"><p>Children who are unable to live with their parent(s) for their welfare and protection are taken into the care of the Child and Family Agency and placed mainly in foster care. Less than 1% of children in care with specialised needs are placed in a High Support or Special Care Unit. </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency informed my Department on 16th January 2014, that revised arrangements for the management of cases under consideration for a special care placement were being implemented. The reason for the change was that the Agency found the circumstances for some children on the waiting list had changed quite radically and this distorted their priority need for a special care placement. An example was where a child was sent to a detention school for a specified period and was therefore no longer in immediate need of a special care  placement. Other cases included where  a child's situation improved, having been  provided with supports in their placement, and they were no longer in  need of a place in special care.  Children who were on remand or detention or on the waiting list for longer than 8 weeks prior to the new arrangements were removed to allow each social worker to reassess the child's risk profile. In order to be reconsidered for a special care placement, the reassessment must provide evidence to the Admissions Committee that the young person again meets the criteria for Special Care. The practice where a social worker sought a prioritised place on the waiting list, in case the child's situation in their current placement deteriorated, but there was no immediate need identified was also discontinued. These new measures, which were introduced with immediate effect, reduced the waiting list to zero pending the undertaking of  reassessments. As I informed the Deputy on 12th February 2014, I was advised by the Agency that there was no child awaiting a placement in Special Care at that time.  I am informed that there were two children waiting for placement in Special Care on 21st March 2014. </p><p>  The Agency advised that as of the 21st March there were 17 children in the three Special Care Units - ten are in Ballydowd, four in Gleann Alainn and three in Coovagh House. There were three children residing in Crannog Nua High Support Unit.  </p><p>  The Agency is committed to designing and developing a comprehensive continuum of care services to meet the divergent and complex needs of all children in care. A national review of all residential care is underway.  I am assured that this review will direct planning to ensure that appropriate placements are accessible to children with varying and complex needs.  </p></reply>

As part of the quality agenda, therefore, I announced last year that by September 2015 all staff working with children in early years services would have to have a minimum Level 5 (on the National Qualifications Framework) qualification  in early years care and education, or an equivalent qualification.  In addition, by September 2015, Preschool Leaders delivering the free PreSchool Year programme will have to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent. </p><p>The 2014 Budget included an allocation of &euro;1.5 million in both 2014 and 2015, to help to support existing staff to meet the new qualification requirements. Yesterday I announced the launch of a Learner Fund, which will be administered by Pobal with the help of local City and County Childcare Committees.  The Fund will provide funding for a two-year period specifically to assist existing staff working directly with children in registered early years services to meet the new requirements. The fund will be used to subsidise the cost for eligible learners to undertake accredited Level 5 and Level 6 courses provided by certain approved training providers. Training courses subsidised under this fund are expected to commence in September 2014. Full details of the eligibility criteria and how to apply are available on the Pobal website.  Information was also provded through CCCs and through voluntary childcare organisations, as well as on my Department's website.</p><p>Training Providers interested in delivering some of this training anywhere in the country may submit an online Expression of Interest through a link on Pobal&rsquo;s website during the next three weeks. To be eligible, Training Providers will need to meet a number of criteria including being  registered with Quality and Qualifications Ireland  with validated programmes of learning. The Expression of Interest process is expected to be completed by the end of May 2014 when an approved panel of training providers will be created for the Learner Fund.   </p><p>Individual applicants can submit an online application for a subsidised training course under the Learner Fund. To be eligible, they must be currently working directly with children in a registered early years service and meet the criteria for the Learner Fund which will be set out in the application process.  Applications will be accepted for the next four weeks. The Learner Fund is limited and it is expected that applications will be considered on a &ldquo;first-come&rdquo; basis. Confirmation of the outcome of applications is expected to be completed in June 2014.</p><p>Further details are available on the Pobal website as well as on my Department's website. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-27a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032700012#WRA01200"><p>I launched the Child Care Law Reporting Project in November 2012 to provide information on the circumstances that lead the Child and Family Agency to seek Care and Supervision Orders in Court. The Project provides a  snapshot  report of  selected cases from courts around the country. It does not report on all cases. The majority of cases reported on to date were in Dublin. </p><p>  The report provides an account of the sad and sometimes tragic circumstances  of children's lives, the work of the Agency in providing for their welfare and protection and the role of the courts  in deciding on applications for the various orders.</p><p>  The Project published Child Care Statistics for 2012 that are gathered by the Courts Service.  These statistics show the court activity with respect to the numbers and types of applications being heard in Dublin and in 34 courts around the country and that the volume of applications varies greatly between towns of similar size.   The figures relate to the number of orders rather than the number of children in care.  There are no significant discrepancies in the number of children in care across the local areas. National data at 31/12/12, shows that 42% of children were in care by way of voluntary agreement with parent(s), 46% were under a Care Order, 9% were under an Interim Care Order and 2% under an Emergency Care Order.</p><p>  The largest single category of application was for Interim Care Orders. This number is inflated in the period by a legal requirement for renewal of such orders every eight days. However, a change in legislation early in 2013 has reduced the need for repeat applications in 2013. </p><p>  The Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1st January last, will bring a renewed focus on delivering safe and effective services for children and families who need a wide continuum of supports and interventions.  The Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of approaches to dealing with families where there are concerns about the welfare and protection of children. Historically, some areas would have worked more on a voluntary basis with families where others would have sought the assistance of the Courts earlier. </p><p>  It is a matter for the Court Services as to how they arrange for the hearing of child care proceedings in different areas and  how they produce their statistics. I am not therefore in a position to comment further on the information on court activity provided in this report.</p></reply>

The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring files from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Health Service Executive. These services are now the responsibility of the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  The Agency advises that priorities include the reduction in waiting time for the information and tracing service through the following initiatives:</p><p>  - The re-distribution of records from individual institutions in their entirety to the appropriate adoption teams around the country</p><p>  - The re-deployment of social workers within existing adoption teams to information and tracing work.</p><p>  This work has seen a net increase of five staff to the information and tracing service and the benefit of this will be evident in the immediate term.</p><p>  Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the Agency Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, which had responsibility for Bessboro, Co Cork; Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co Tipperary; and Castlepollard, Co Westmeath.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these files has taken place and the Agency is anxious to preserve the integrity of these records.  The Agency has sought the advice of the National Archives in relation to the proper storage of these files that are of great significance.</p><p>  The Agency also has records that include those for St. Anne&rsquo;s Adoption Society; St Mary&rsquo;s Adoption Society, Kerry; Ard Mhuire, Dunboyne, Co Meath; Limerick Catholic Adoption Society; St Patrick's Mother and Baby Home Navan Road, Dublin; St Louise's Adoption Society Dublin; Dublin Health Authority Board of Assistance; Rotunda Girls Aid Society; the Ossory Kilkenny Adoption Society; St Kevin's and St Johns Adoption Societies. Furthermore PACT, who are an agency accredited under the Act, have records of various Protestant organisations.</p><p>  Records already transferred to the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency are, for the most part, stored in the offices of the Child and Family Agency with a small number retained in appropriate commercial storage facilities. With respect to records which have yet to transfer to the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency, discussions are currently underway with St Bridget&rsquo;s Adoption Society, the National Maternity Hospital and St Patrick Guild.  There is a significant volume of documentation involved in the transfer of these records, particularly with respect to St. Patrick Guild, and the safe and secure preservation and storage of these historical documents forms part of these discussions.  A review of the costs associated with this work and other aspects of the scanning, archiving and storage of adoptions records is underway.</p><p>   The Agency has advised that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Child and Family Agency Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-27a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014032700013#WRB00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 25 together.</p><p>  The Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption is a multilateral treaty concluded on May 29, 1993 in The Hague, Netherlands. There are currently 93 contracting states to this Convention. Ireland ratified the Convention on 1st November 2010. Ireland strongly supports the principles of the Convention, which strengthen protections for children, birth parents, and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process. The Convention provides a framework for Convention countries to work together to ensure that adoptions take place in the best interests of children and to prevent the abduction, sale, or trafficking of children in connection with intercountry adoption. The Convention requires authorities to prioritise the improvement of domestic systems for the care and adoption of children.  This is in line with Article 21 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has also ratified. The increasing international recognition and commitment to the Hague Convention, particularly amongst a growing number of developing countries, is extremely welcome in providing safeguards for adoption processes and for those children whom are now benefiting from improved child welfare, protection and care arrangements in their own countries.</p><p>  Under current Irish legislation, applicants who seek an assessment as to their eligibility and suitability to adopt are entitled to that assessment from the Child and Family Agency. The assessment leads to an application to the Adoption Authority for a Declaration of Eligibility &amp;amp; Suitability to Adopt. If the applicants are found to be eligible and suitable, then a Declaration is issued. A declaration allows an applicant to apply to adopt, it is not a guarantee that an adoption will take place. It is now a reality that the numbers of children available for intercountry adoption has fallen worldwide. For example, total number of children adopted into the top twelve receiving states in 2004 was 43,142. In 2011, this figure had dropped to 21,911 or by some 50 per cent.  The Adoption Authority can only authorise placement of children with applicants where the children are available for adoption and have been referred by the sending country in question.</p><p>  Significant work is under way with suitable countries where there is potential to promote closer cooperation in intercountry adoption matters.  Following Vietnam's ratification of the Hague Convention Ireland was the first country to conclude an administrative agreement relating to intercountry adoption. A similar agreement has been put in place with the United States.  The Adoption Authority is currently engaging with a number of other Hague Convention countries in relation to intercountry adoptions including the Central Authority for India, China, Thailand and the Philippines.  Haiti is due to enter into the Hague Convention next month and a delegation from the Adoption Authority will visit there next week.  I am also aware that Ethiopia is currently seeking to bring its adoption standards up to those required under the Hague Convention and I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me updated on the position. It is important to recognise that, although a country may be a member of Hague, legal and administrative obstacles may remain, there may be no children available for adoption or restrictions may be set in relation to the categories of children or prospective adoptive parents qualifying for intercountry adoption.</p><p>  The Adoption Act, 2010 requires that adoptions from countries which have not ratified the Hague Convention can only take place where there is a bi-lateral agreement in place or under certain transitional arrangements which applied to certain prospective adoptive parents who had commenced the adoption process before the Adoption Act came into effect.  Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention.  However, my Department is continuing its discussion with the Russian authorities with a view to exploring the possibilities of establishing a bi-lateral agreement.

This report contains a number of recommendations on a range of topics, some particular to specific sectors, including Justice and Education, and others with wider implications.</p><p>  One of the recommendations was to extend the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to complaints in respect of boys detained in St. Patrick's Institution. The Deputy will already be aware that I made an Order by Statutory Instrument Number 210 of 2012 which took effect on 1st July 2012, in consultation with my colleague Minster Shatter, to extend the remit for the Ombudsman for Children to include children in detention in St Patrick's Institution.</p><p>  Later in 2012, through the process towards the enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, I worked closely with Minister Howlin and the Ombudsman for Children to achieve a significant expansion of the remit of her office. With effect from 1<sup>st</sup> May 2013, the bodies within the remit of each Ombudsman and the process for changes to their remits have been greatly expanded and largely aligned.  As a result of amendments contained in sections 4 and 22 of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 any reviewable agency which comes under the remit of the Ombudsman will now automatically come under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children. Thus the jurisdictions of both offices are aligned and there is legal certainty and clarity on the matter.</p><p>  Some outstanding recommendations from the above-mentioned reports of March 2012 are being considered in conjunction with other Departments and I will consider the need to bring forward legislative proposals in due course if appropriate.</p></reply>

My Department has commissioned and funded a research project which is being conducted by University College Cork and which is looking at the impact of commercialisation and sexualisation of children in Ireland. This important research is currently undergoing peer review and is expected to be published before the Summer.</p><p>  In addition, I can confirm that my Department has commissioned the Centre for Effective Services to undertake an international review of other countries' responses to these issues, which will build on the University College Cork research project, and which I would hope will inform the Government's response and future actions.</p><p>   I believe there is a strong role for civil society and public opinion leaders in highlighting the dangers of child beauty pageants and I very much welcome the cross party Seanad motion on this issue to which the Government gave its support. The answer is not always legislative and I would note that legislative proposals in France on banning pageants ran into difficulties in light of criticisms regarding the vagueness around the specifics of what types of events were addressed. I also believe this issue must be seen in the context of the broader sexualisation and commercialisation of children.  As part of my efforts to tackle these broader problems, in 2012 I extended an invitation to the Irish retail sector to respond to increasing concerns about the sexualisation of childrenswear. Retail Ireland, responded to my call and accepted my invitation to bring forward Ireland&rsquo;s first ever guidelines on the 'responsible retailing of childrenswear'.</p><p>  These guidelines are not just about restricting what retailers can sell, but instead provide a more constructive guidance on best practice on a range of issues such as styling, slogans, age-appropriateness, size, labelling and marketing.  I believe this code is now playing an important and constructive role in informing future decision-making by retailers and I am happy to report that the number of complaints regarding inappropriate childrenswear have fallen. However I would urge parents to continue to feedback any concerns or complaints, either in-store or by contacting retail@ibec.ie.</p><p>  An Coimisium le Rinci Gaelacha, The Irish Dancing Commission, is also to be commended for their introduction of additional rules prohibiting the use of make-up including false eye lashes, the tinted make-up I mentioned, and artificial tanning products for the face. Dancers who are ten years of age or younger may no longer compete using any of these.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits the Government to promoting greater coordination and integration of delivery of services to the Traveller and migrant community across Government, using available resources more effectively to deliver on principles of social inclusion, particularly in the area of Traveller education.</p><p>  The National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework, which I plan to launch shortly, will cover the seven year period from 2014 to 2020 and will address Government commitments in relation to Traveller and migrant children.</p><p>  Eighteen youth projects receive funding targeted at young travellers, separated children seeking asylum and young refugees. These projects offer a wide range of programmes and services aimed at young people at risk of early school-leaving, truancy, social exclusion, substance misuse and involvement in crime. Funding for these projects in 2014 will amount to approximately &euro;1.6 million. In addition in 2014 over &euro;0.2 million is being provided to INVOLVE, formerly known as the National Association of Traveller Centres, under the Youth Service Grant Scheme.</p><p>  With regard to education, through its various interventions in the education sector, the Government is committed to improved retention rates, better learning experiences and improved outcomes for all children, including children who are members of the Travelling and migrant community. Recorded overall Traveller participation rates in education in recent years has shown a steady increase, as do rates for participation in the junior cycle and for progression to senior cycle. The new Child and Family Agency also has a role to play in the context its statutory remit for services previously provided by the National Educational Welfare Board, relating to educational welfare and school completion.</p><p>  For separated children seeking asylum, the Child and Family Agency has a national operational policy on the standards and services to be provided. The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum vis a vis all children at risk and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, practices, priorities, standards or protocols for such children. In April 2013, a report commissioned from Barnardos and entitled &quot;Foster Care and Supported Lodgings for Separated Asylum Seeking Young People in Ireland: The views of children, carers and stakeholders&quot; was launched. The research showed that enormous improvement had been made in terms of the care being provided to separated children.</p><p>  On the subject of immigrant integration, the Government decided to commence a review of the current integration strategy with the intention of developing a modern, cross-Departmental policy for the coming years, encompassing a whole of Government approach. A high level committee has been established under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality, and an official from my Department attended its inaugural meeting yesterday. My Department is also represented on the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee, which is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

It delivers on a key Programme for Government commitment and represents one of the largest and most important public sector reforms undertaken by this Government, bringing together some 4,000 staff and a budget of some &euro;609 million to provide a dedicated focus on services for children &amp;amp; families. The formation of the Agency brought together key services relevant to children and families including child protection and welfare services, and services previously provided by the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.</p><p>  My Department supports a range of education welfare services which are delivered through the Child and Family Agency to support children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The Agency has a statutory remit to support children and young people to participate in and benefit from the education system.</p><p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;50.530m including &euro;750,000 capital funding is being provided by my Department for these schemes. </p><p>  My Department is undertaking a comprehensive Value for Money Review of youth funding schemes that support services to disadvantaged or at-risk young people. The findings of this review will shape the future direction of youth funding provided by my Department and will aim to ensure quality effective value-for-money services that secure best outcomes for young people. </p><p>  My Department is also developing a new youth strategy. The new youth strategy will take into account the changes in the demographic situation and in the profiles of young people and the evidence about what works best in the provision of youth services to meet young people's needs. It will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.  </p><p>  The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme 2013-2016 is being implemented by my Department, in partnership with Atlantic Philanthropies who are co-funding the programme's total allocation of &euro;29.7m.  The programme will deliver the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty, drawing on best international practice and existing services to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people.  A total number of 13 areas have been approved to participate in the ABC programme.</p><p>  Following on from consultations with 211 children and young people living in the care of the State in a number of locations around the country, I launched <i>Listen to Our Voices: A Report of Consultations with Children Living in the Care of the State (2011)</i>.  I invited children and young people who had taken part in the consultations to sit on a Voice of Children in Care Implementation Group and 18 children and young people became involved in the Group.  They have met with my Department on a regular basis since May 2012 and  last year the Group renamed itself TACTIC - Teenagers and Children Talking in Care.</p><p>  The Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) based in my Department since January 2012, is responsible for leading and driving reform in the youth justice area by focusing on diversion and rehabilitation, including greater use of community-based interventions, promotion of initiatives to deal with young people who offend, providing a safe and secure environment for detained young people and supporting their early re-integration into the community.</p></reply>

Significant investment, totalling more than &euro;260m, is being provided this year by my Department to provide for a number of childcare programmes that assist parents with the cost of childcare.  These programmes include the Free Pre-School Year, from which approximately 68,000 children benefit annually.  The financial benefit to the parent of a child participating in the free pre-school year is about &euro;2,500.  </p><p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme, which provides targeted benefit primarily to lower income and disadvantaged families, is also accessible to parents who have relatively average incomes on the basis of their entitlement to hold a GP visit card.  About 25,000 children each year benefit from this programme.  Parents who qualify for the highest rate of support can have the weekly charge reduced by up to &euro;95 for each child.</p><p>  Funding is also provided by my Department to support the Childhood Education and Training Support programme which targets funding to support parents seeking to return to the workforce who are participating in Solas or Education and Training Boards education and training programmes.  About 2,500 childcare places are provided each year under this initiative.  Parents qualifying under this programme can have the overall charge reduced by as much as &euro;145 per week for each child.  A further 1,800 part-time childcare places are available under the CETS programme to Community Employment scheme participants.  In addition, 600 places are available under the School Age Childcare programme, which targets social welfare recipients availing of employment opportunities.</p><p>  I have succeeded, despite the challenging budgetary situation, in maintaining these childcare programmes, ensuring that a significant number of children can avail of quality childcare services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.  I am happy to advise the Deputy that a review of the childcare support programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the coming year with a view to identifying areas where they could be enhanced and improved to ensure the best use of the investment which is currently being made in this area.</p></reply>

Following my invitation to the Russian Ministry of Education and Science in August 2013, a delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland in October 2013 for discussions on a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation. The meeting of the 22nd October 2013 was very positive and detailed discussions took place between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the  HSE.</p><p>  At the meeting significant progress was made and my Department, in early November 2013, forwarded to the Russian side further detailed proposals based on the discussions which took place. Following this my Department prepared revised draft wording on a number of specific points which were recently forwarded to the Russian Authorities. In transmitting these revisions to the Russian authorities it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.   </p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of 2012 was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement. The Authority has also sought and received advice on the legal compatibility of Irish adoption law with that of Ethiopia. The AAI legal advisors have considered this advice and certain clarifications are being sought. The Authority is also trying to establish the position of the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Ethiopia with regard to the desire of the Ethiopian authorities to enter into talks in relation to a bilateral agreement with Ireland.  The Authority will advise me of the position when all the information is available. It is not possible to provide a timeframe for when the Authority's deliberations will be finished. </p><p>  The Adoption Authority is currently engaging with a number of Hague countries, such as China, India, the USA, Bulgaria, Thailand and the Philippines and is currently seeking to expand the number of Hague countries with which it engages.</p></reply>

I intend to proceed  to finalise legislative proposals on a revised basis at the earliest opportunity and will bring proposals to the Government as soon as possible. </p><p>  As well as the information and tracing legislation, I am conscious that  issues have arisen in relation to the operation of the Adoption Act, 2010,  since its enactment. There are a number of general policy questions around the nature of our adoption regime and I consider it timely to consider a review of adoption.  Given the range and complexity of the issues this will require scoping and preliminary examination after which decisions will be made on the extent and time scale for the review to see if proposals for legislative change emerge from this review or the nature of such proposals.  Based upon the many domestic and international legal aspects to adoption the issue of further legislative development will certainly be considered. This review will inform future operational and legislative considerations regarding the Adoption Act, 2010. For the present, however, my legislative priority in the area of adoption is the preparation of  information and tracing legislation. </p></reply>

This area of services, representing a very small number of children in care, is also the most challenging. The report outlined the importance of good care planning and the availability of special placements for children who need them. The findings of the report show the need for improved assessment, care planning and early access to therapy for children with high level needs.</p><p>  A number of recommendations for both the Child and Family Agency and my Department are included in the report. It is worth noting that there has already been progress in a number of these areas in recent years, with further work currently underway.</p><p>The new Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1 January  brings a dedicated focus to child protection/welfare and family supports; to oversee further service developments and reforms. A new service delivery framework has been introduced involving a national approach to case assessment and management. Children and families identified as having welfare needs can be quickly diverted to family support services, allowing social workers to assess and respond to child protection concerns in a timely fashion. A new streamlined management system and quality assurance framework is being also implemented by the Agency.</p><p>  The Agency is developing a  National Child Protection Notification System, which will give social workers, emergency departments and Garda&iacute; timely access to information on child protection history. The National Child Care Information System, to manage information on children in care, is now at implementation phase and being rolled-out by the Agency. A comprehensive strategic plan for residential care is also being developed by the Agency.  A new supervision policy for social work staff was implemented in 2013.</p><p>  National Standards for Child Protection &amp;amp; Welfare Services were published in 2012. The Health Information and Quality Authority commenced inspection of the HSE Child and Family Social Work Services against these standards in late 2012 and inspections of these services in the Agency are continuing.</p><p>  The Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group is continuing to support the on-going implementation of Children First; with legislation to place aspects of Children First guidance on a statutory foot to be published shortly.</p><p>  The Ombudsman's report also found that multiple placements were a feature in some of the 10 cases described in the report. I note that in December 2012, 172 children (2.7 % of children in care) had experienced three or more placements in the previous year.  The comparable rate for England and Wales stands at 10% per annum.</p><p>  It is imperative that to be successful in improving the delivery of children&rsquo;s services that lessons are learned from the past and recommendations are implemented.   The wide ranging reform programme that has been undertaken to date and continues in the  Child and Family Agency will address many of the problems highlighted in this report.</p></reply>

Primary responsibility for engaging with emigrant communities and the wider Diaspora falls within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Irish Abroad Unit of the Department takes the lead role on this engagement and administers a number of schemes and programmes targeted at and supporting Irish communities abroad, including the Emigrant Support Programme.  Since 2004, the Department, through the Emigrant Support Programme, has disbursed in excess of &euro;100 million towards a wide range of organisations and projects supporting Irish citizens and community and Diaspora groups around the world.</p><p>  Other programmes that are administered by the Irish Abroad Unit include the Presidential Distinguished Service Award, the Centenarian Bounty for Irish citizens living outside the State and the Certificate of Irish Heritage.</p><p>  Additionally, in recognising the continuing goodwill of Irish emigrants and that of the large Irish Diaspora, towards Ireland, the Irish Abroad Unit coordinates the Global Irish Network and manages meetings of the Global Irish Economic Forum which have taken place in 2009, 2011 and 2013.   </p><p>  I recently announced a public consultation as part of a comprehensive review of our Diaspora policy.

The precise model for implementing such an arrangement would, of course, vary and have to reflect local conditions and other factors. In all cases, the arrangement is one designed to increase the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s presence abroad, to improve coordination among all parties, and to maximise cost-efficiencies. The policy has been implemented on a gradual basis over the intervening years and I regret that it is not possible in the time available to give a detailed chronological narrative as to when each development took place. There are a number of types of Ireland House which include our diplomatic and consular missions abroad and the offices of state agencies operating from the same premises.   These are currently operating in 19 locations overseas. The largest is in New York and comprises the Consulate General, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in addition to other agencies including Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia, the American Ireland Fund and CIE Tours. </p><p>Missions at Boston, Brussels, Budapest, Kuala Lumpur, Prague, Riyadh and Warsaw share premises with Enterprise Ireland.  Our missions at Moscow, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo accommodate both Enterprise Ireland and IDA offices. The Consulate General in Shanghai shares premises with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, and also Bord Bia and an agent for Tourism Ireland; the Ireland House in Madrid includes offices of Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Tourism Ireland, together with the Embassy. Other configurations prevail elsewhere including at Embassy Beijing which shares premises with the IDA; Embassy Stockholm which shares space with Bord Bia; Embassy New Delhi which operates from shared premises with Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland; and Ireland&rsquo;s Consulate General in Atlanta which operates from the same location as the IDA.</p><p>In addition, there are a number of other locations where state agencies share facilities with each other in the form of an Ireland House, which does not include the Irish diplomatic mission to that particular country. For example, in Paris, the IDA, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and BIM operate an Ireland House.</p><p>The Ireland House concept has been implemented where practicable and further opportunities are considered whenever missions or agencies are opening or moving to new locations. I can confirm that the potential for further Ireland House arrangements will be considered in the implementation of the recent Government Decision to expand the diplomatic network.  </p></reply>

This decision was reiterated in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, under Action Point 202: &ldquo;In cooperation with all relevant Departments and agencies, carry out a short and focused review of the Government Trade Strategy, <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy</i>.&rdquo;  A Review Group was established comprising representatives of the relevant Government Departments and State agencies (Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; Department of the Taoiseach; Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Revenue Commissioners; IDA Ireland; Enterprise Ireland; Tourism Ireland; Bord Bia; Culture Ireland; Forf&aacute;s; Science Foundation Ireland), chaired by the Trade and Promotion Division in my Department.  The establishment of the Review Group was in the context of the Export Trade Council (ETC), which I chair, given its role in overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the Strategy. As the Deputy will be aware, the Council brings together the relevant Government Ministers and Departments, State agencies and private sector members.  The review was launched on the 24 February 2014 and a copy of the document has been circulated to all members of the Oireachtas.   </p><p>  The review was considered by the ETC on two occasions: a progress report at the fifth meeting on 7 November 2013 and I presented the completed review document at the sixth meeting of the ETC on 6 February 2014, after the review was noted by Government.  The review was also discussed by a working group under the heading &ldquo;<i>Ireland&rsquo;s Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy - Toward a Renewed Approach&rdquo;</i> at the Global Irish Economic Forum in October 2013.</p><p>  The review is the product of a comprehensive process of consultation with local market teams and our Embassy network, with Departments and State agencies at home and with the private sector.  It is designed to ensure that the resources of the State &ndash; both the Embassy network and State agencies &ndash; are positioned to take full advantage of new opportunities in key emerging markets and to keep delivering in our established markets. </p><p>  The review provides an update to our numerical targets and re-aligns our list of priority sectors so that they are aligned with the Action Plan for Jobs.  It also introduces a &lsquo;new market approach&rsquo;, which disaggregates the list of our priority markets and includes additional high potential and exploratory markets to ensure that Ireland also engages with high growth markets in Asia, South America and Africa. In order to achieve our targets, the review provides a revised &lsquo;action plan model&rsquo;, which recognises the responsibility of Government to provide the best possible platform for companies and State agencies to win business overseas.  These changes emphasise the positive benefits that accrue through maximising the coordination between Embassies and State agencies in the field and our coordination at home. </p><p>  The implementation of the Strategy and the modifications encompassed by this review will continue to be overseen by the ETC, which provides an effective framework for coordination and consultation.  The review provides further guidance and promotes a shared understanding of in-market developments across the diverse range of entities involved, while recognising that they each have their own specific goals, targets and priorities.</p></reply>

The facts around this have been confirmed by the management team.   The proposed receiver advised that, if appointed by NAMA, he would be legally obliged to consider the new bid, since he has a statutory obligation to secure the best price reasonably obtainable for the secured assets at the time of their sale. Media reporting of the emergence of this further bid caused concern among suppliers and trade creditors, which the Directors of Staunton Sports brought to NAMA s attention.  Having regard to the deteriorating condition of the business and the company s insolvent position, and based on legal advice, NAMA and the Directors of Staunton Sports decided that Examinership was an alternative option, which would permit all bids to be considered while the Company was under the protection of the High Court.  NAMA is funding the company during the Examinership process, which includes funding the payment of suppliers and staff wages.</p><p>   I note the statement in the past week from the Directors of the company, which acknowledges the support of NAMA in the current Examinership process and states the Board s confidence that the current process will deliver best results for all the stakeholders.</p><p>   As the Deputy will be aware, NAMA is obliged by Section 10 of the NAMA Act to obtain the best achievable return for the taxpayer. However, NAMA attaches a very high priority to the preservation of jobs in any businesses that have loans with the Agency.  As evidence of this, NAMA, through the deployment of working capital, is directly supporting 15,000 jobs in Ireland in trading businesses linked to its loans.  The sectors involved include property, hotel and leisure, retail, healthcare, manufacturing and agriculture.  </p></reply>

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school.  Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment.  In addition, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000.  This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated.  The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.  To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.</p><p>  The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy.  It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions. </p><p>  In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than &euro;10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge. This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid.  I have no plans to introduce any further tax reliefs for childcare costs.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  As the Deputy will also appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

The Department will continue to provide a book grant as usual to all primary schools. This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme. </p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years and I am aware of the difficulties faced by schools in relation to these schemes. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.   Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim. </p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme. The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.</p><p>  The Department has contacted primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.  Schools that indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental/loan scheme will not therefore qualify for funding.</p></reply>

It clearly specifies what is required in relation to CSPE.   If schools opt to offer their first year students entering post-primary school in September 2014 the existing syllabus in CSPE, then those CSPE students will present for certification in 2017, as per current practice.  The terminal components of the CSPE examination for these students will be timetabled, set and marked by the State Examinations Commission in 2017. This will be the final year that the SEC will administer the CSPE examination.  If schools choose to offer the new short course in CSPE, then the work of those students will be assessed by their teachers through school based assessment.  </p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that I signed a Memorandum of Understanding between my Department and the County and City Managers' Association (CCMA) in 2012.  This Memorandum of Understanding fosters increased levels of cooperation and formalises the Local Authorities' part in identifying and securing sites for educational use. In that context, my Department is working in conjunction with Cork County Council towards securing as soon as possible a permanent site to meet the needs of the school to which the Deputy refers.   Whilst I can advise the Deputy that options are under consideration, due to the sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally I am not in a position to provide further information at this time. However, once the acquisition of a site is finalised, a design team for the project will be appointed with a view to its progression to tender and construction. </p></reply>

This Bill has been referred to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection, where it can be considered in the context of forthcoming proposals to establish a new model for the allocation of resource teaching supports in mainstream schools.  I wish to advise the Deputy also that the report published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children, including those with Down syndrome, should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  The NCSE also recommended that, in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome in the Mild General Learning Disability category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  An NCSE Working Group has been charged with developing proposals for a new allocation model. Any changes to the current allocation model will therefore be considered in the light of the recommendations of the report of this Group.</p></reply>

Pupils who have care needs may receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in schools. Many children with Down syndrome have access to such SNA support.   Other supports include provision for Assistive Technology support which can ensure that educational materials can be provided in accessible formats.  </p><p>  With regard to the admissions process to schools, on 25th March, the Government approved the drafting of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2014. This new legislation aims to ensure that the enrolment process in all primary and post-primary schools is inclusive, transparent and fair. Among the provisions in the new Bill, will be a requirement for all schools to make an explicit statement in their admissions policy that they will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability.</p><p>  In relation to admission to higher education, the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a college and university admissions scheme which offers places at reduced points to school leavers with disabilities.  Eighteen higher education institutions are currently participating in the scheme. For further information on DARE see also www.accesscollege.ie. </p><p>To assist pupils to then attend third level education, core funding for access programmes for pupils with disabilities is allocated each year as part of the overall budget of each designated higher education institution. This funding supports the provision of dedicated staff, services and supports for students with disabilities.</p><p>  Every further and higher education institution has at least one member of staff with responsibility for liaising with students with disabilities, as required by the Disability Act 2005. In addition, many institutions have a dedicated Disability Support Service with trained disability officers, learning support officers and other specialist staff. The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) also provides additional funding to both further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities.</p><p>  With regard to alternative forms of testing and evaluation, I wish to advise the Deputy that secondary school students with special needs may have special arrangements made for them while sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate.  Candidates with disabilities, including Down syndrome, can apply through their school for reasonable accommodation during examinations.  Details of the reasonable accommodations that can be made for pupils with special educational needs is available at www.examinations.ie.  </p><p>In relation to standardised testing, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment guidelines on  &quot;Assessment in the Primary School Curriculum &ndash; Guidelines for Schools&quot;  provides general guidance for schools including on using alternative tests in relation to the standardised testing of pupils in primary schools.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the recent NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children, including those with Down syndrome, should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. An NCSE Working Group has been charged with developing proposals for a new allocation model. Any changes to the current allocation model will therefore be considered in the light of the recommendations of the report of this Group.</p></reply>

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. Students must meet both the nationality and residency criterion in order to be considered under the scheme.</p><p>  Where students do not qualify for free fees they must pay the appropriate fee as determined by their third level institution. The institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees schemes are matters for the relevant institution. However, in the case of students who do not meet the residency clause of the free fees scheme, I have requested that the higher education institutions charge the more moderate EU fees to EU/EEA/Swiss nationals who have completed at least five academic years of study (Primary or Post-Primary level) in the EU/EEA or Switzerland.</p><p>  This common approach across the sector will provide all prospective students with clarity about the level of tuition fees they may be required to pay.</p></reply>

These will be addressed in the new Digital Strategy for Schools which is in the process of being developed. In relation to curricular reform the new junior cycle in post-primary schools outlines eight key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. Among the key skills, one is literacy and numeracy, which includes digital literacy.</p><p>  The PDST Technology in Education provided in their 2013 summer course programme for teachers a course 'Active learning in literacy and numeracy using tablet devices'. This five day course was run in 28 different venues around the country with approximately 400 training places. In addition, 48 tutors were trained to deliver the course and it is intended that these tutors will be used during the school year and in summer 2014 to offer the same professional development opportunity to other teachers. Also, PDST Technology in Education have produced an advice sheets for schools and good practice videos specifically relating to the use of tablet devices.</p><p>  I am aware of the fact that parents are being asked to fund the introduction of tablet devices into the classrooms. In relation to the introduction of tablet devices in schools this is an operational matter for the Board of Management of each school and my Department has no role at individual school level in approving such initiatives. I believe it is important that where new technology, is being adopted by schools parents should be consulted prior to the decision being made and that the costs implications are fully considered by the Boards of Management.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p><p>Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.

There are four BIC&rsquo;s located throughout the country as follows &ndash; Dublin BIC, Cork BIC, South East BIC based in Waterford and Westbic based in Galway.</p><p>  The BICs were established in 1988 as a European Union initiative and until the end of 1999 the BICs were funded by the EU. Since 2000, EU funding was replaced by Government exchequer funding, which is channelled through and managed by Enterprise Ireland (EI). The four BIC&rsquo;s currently receive combined core funding of &euro;2.2m per annum. </p><p>  EI is represented on the Board of each BIC and plans are in place to develop a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with each BIC by the second quarter of 2014.  </p><p>  The BICs operate under their Articles and Memorandum of Association and relevant Company Law provisions.  Dublin BIC is licensed by the Central Bank to operate seed capital funds. Dublin, Cork and Waterford BICs are registered charities. (The main advantage to registered charity status is tax designation in that any funds received, including EI funds or donations from any other sources are not taxable). The BIC&rsquo;s are not subject to FOI.</p><p>  Each BIC has developed its own networks and relationships within its region. This means that the individual BIC operate in their own way and have a distinct structure which suits their purpose.</p><p>  Working in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland the BICs help to refine early stage business propositions with HPSU potential and helps the promoter in building an Investor Ready Business Plan.  This is a very valuable service in supporting early stage enquiries and start up companies.</p><p>  DBIC is a joint General Partner/Manager of the AIB Seed Capital Fund in which Enterprise Ireland and AIB Bank plc are Limited Partners under the Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme (2007-2012).  This fund is one of a number of funds targeting early stage investments in high growth technology companies and is managed by DBIC on behalf of the Limited Partners.</p><p>  Business Angels have a significant role to play in the start-up ecosystem providing both a source of capital and expertise to investees.  In order to improve the access of SMEs to this source of finance Enterprise Ireland funds the Halo Business Angel Partnership in cooperation with InterTrade Ireland.  The Partnership network, amongst other things, matches pre-screened investment opportunities in start-up enterprises with registered investors and is managed by the 4 Business Innovation Centres on a regional basis throughout Ireland (Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford). </p><p>  DBIC has been part of the Business Angels initiative since its inception in 2005 and Enterprise Ireland has provided funding towards DBICs activities in relation to the matching process.  Under the current contract with DBIC, Enterprise Ireland will provide &euro;85,500 p.a. in the period 2013-2014.</p><p>  The four Irish BIC&rsquo;s are members of the European Business Network (EBN) (  ) which has over 240 members in 27 EU member states and in 11 other countries and whose aim is to promote and grow the BIC network and to support small and medium sized business. The Irish BICs participate in a number of events and activities including consultancy assignments organised by the EBN network.</p></reply>

The grant instrument was introduced in May 2012 and allows applicants to apply for grant support for a broad range of eligible expenditures relevant to investigating the technical and/or commercial viability of a new business. Typical elements and costs supported in carrying out a HPSU feasibility study include; market research, business plan development, technical research and prototyping. Encouraging and stimulating individuals and early stage start-up businesses to apply for HPSU feasibility grant support is a key element of the Action Plan for Jobs and Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland does not provide HPSU Feasibility Study Grant application details relating to the names of the entrepreneurs or details relating to their new and innovative business ideas without the express permission of the applicants due to commercial sensitivities relating to this information.  </p><p>Evaluation of applications under the HPSU Feasibility Study Grant instrument is undertaken solely by Enterprise Ireland staff and management.   External consultants are not employed by Enterprise Ireland in evaluating this specific grant instrument. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland provides a range of supports and advice in respect of new business ideas and potential applicants for HPSU feasibility study funding must consult their assigned Enterprise Ireland Development Adviser prior to submission of an application to discuss their proposal.

This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the Union.  All such grants come from the exchequer, i.e. there is no EU or other external funding. </p><p>  During the Regional Aid Guideline process thus far, my Department has consulted relevant stakeholders including various Government Departments, the industrial development agencies, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Forf&aacute;s, the Central Statistics Office, the Border Midland and Western Regional Assembly, the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly, and the eight Regional Authorities. </p><p>  It will not be possible to include all regions in the map. Instead, qualifying regions up to a maximum of 51.28% of the total population can be included. My officials have compiled the most up to date economic data for each region and county, including the South East NUTS 3 Region, in order to determine which areas will qualify for inclusion in a revised Regional Aid Map for Ireland. Relevant data includes comparative unemployment levels and GDP by county.</p><p>  My Department has issued the proposed Regional Aid Map for Ireland to the Commission for consideration and approval. It would be inappropriate to disclose the contents of this submission until the Commission has finalised its consideration of the matter. </p><p>  It is important to note that all of the Country, including those areas not entitled to Regional Aid, can qualify for other forms of State investment e.g. Research &amp;amp; Development Aid, SME Investment Aid, Training Aid, and Aid for Environmental protection etc. </p></reply>

The management and location of IDA Ireland staff is a day to day operational matter for the Agency and not one in which I have a function.  I am informed by the Agency that the Regional Business Development Manager for the whole of the South Region, which includes Waterford, is based in Cork.  There are 5 IDA personnel based Waterford with client facing and regional responsibilities.  These staff work with the existing client base in the South East Region to ensure their ongoing sustainability and growth and facilitate new name client itineraries into the Region.  They also work with key stakeholders to ensure that the Region has a competitive and ever improving offering, </p><p>  The success of this strategy is borne out by the two significant investments won for Waterford during 2013.  In February 2013, Sanofi announced plans to invest &euro;44m in Genzyme's biotechnology campus in Waterford.  This investment will increase the site's diversity of products and comes on top of a &euro;150m investment a little more than a year previously.  The investment ensures that the Waterford facility, which currently employs approximately 500 people, can produce the company's latest products and provides an indication of the Waterford site's value to the company.  In March 2013, Nypro Healthcare announced plans to establish an additional state of the art medical devices facility in Waterford.  This will result in the creation of over 200 new high quality jobs in the coming years.</p><p>  Furthermore, in order to improve the offering in the Region to win new business, IDA Ireland has signed contracts for the construction of an advanced manufacturing facility in Waterford.  This facility, which will be 2,348 sq metres in area, will be located in the IDA Technology Park at Butlerstown and will be completed by year end.  The building design has taken account of the flexibility requirement of potential end users by creating a front of house open plan area with an open plan production area to the rear offering large scale flexibility for either large scale open plan use or the potential to subdivide or introduce cellular spaces.  In addition IDA Ireland has rolled out a dedicated digital marketing initiative for inward investment focusing on the South East Region and Waterford (Connect and Invest Waterford).  Initiatives such as this can enhance the marketability of the location for investment at a very early stage in a perspective client's decision-making process. </p><p>  IDA Ireland remains a key supporter of the South East Employment Action Plan which brings together a number of stakeholders in addressing the persistent employment challenges faced in the South East Region.</p></reply>

In 2013, the Board approved grant aid for 29 projects, with a value of &euro;577k and an associated potential of 126 jobs.  The CEB also ran a range of training and management development programmes with over 870 participants and approved access to mentoring services for over 90 businesses.  The latest figures available indicate that there are 2,434 people employed on a full-time and part-time basis in companies supported by the CEB in Co. Donegal.  Already in 2014, the Board has run the Annual Donegal Business Week with over 780 participants attending the 19 events held during the week.  The week was organised by the CEB in conjunction with Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Donegal Local Development Company, WestBic, Letterkenny IT/CoLab and Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the CEB will shortly be dissolved and established as a Local Enterprise Office (LEO) within Donegal County Council, as part of the reform of the model of supports for the micro-enterprise sector.  The LEO will integrate the business support and enterprise development functions of the Council with an enhanced range of existing CEB functions, such as making it easier to obtain the full support of Revenue, Social Protection, Microfinance Ireland, the Credit Review Office, Skillnets and the Education and Training Boards.  This reform will result in the provision of the best possible service to people who have a business idea.</p><p>  There are 165 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Donegal employing 3,342 people on a full-time and part-time basis.  Enterprise Ireland runs many initiatives to help sustain existing jobs and to create new jobs in the region and provides funding to the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny to build the research capabilities in the region.  In addition, the Community Enterprise Centres, funded through Enterprise Ireland, are providing enterprise space to cater for micro and small enterprises throughout Donegal.  Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;3.2m in 2013 for companies, entrepreneurs and Third Level institutes in Donegal and to date in 2014, the Agency has made payments of over &euro;281k to companies in Donegal.</p><p>  There are 13 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal employing 2,381 people in full and part time employment in Software Development, Systems Development and the Medical Technology industry.<i></i>Donegal's industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry into high-tech, high-skill activity and IDA Ireland promotes Donegal as a successful location for high-end manufacturing mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector.  In addition IDA Ireland engages with its existing base of companies in Donegal, highlighting the ongoing importance of upskilling/reskilling and the need to add high value activities in order to ensure sustainability and ongoing development.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 contains a number of actions to strengthen enterprise development at the regional level.  Action 177 mandates my Department and its agencies to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate and develop new ways of working, further collaborations and enhance the efforts and activities of the Enterprise Development agencies and the other regional stakeholders in building enterprise based on sustainable competitive advantage of the region.  Regional towns as the drivers of regional economies will obviously be central to the development of these strategies to further enhance the activities of the agencies and the soon to be established LEO network across the regions.</p></reply>

Prior to March 2011 there were 6 staff members assigned to Bilateral Trade Unit, 3 of these posts have since been transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Trade Division now consists of 16.1 (full time equivalent) staff and they deal with bilateral contacts with our export markets and support for trade missions, the range of international bilateral free trade agreements being negotiated by the EU (e.g. with the U.S., Canada, Japan, ASEAN, Latin American and North African countries), negotiations at the World Trade Organisation and export licensing. </p><p>  Arrangements were made in 2011 for the transfer of responsibility to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of certain trade related functions.  These are set out in Statutory Instrument No. 247 of 2011 and include functions relating to the Government strategy for the promotion and development of overseas trade, tourism and investment referred to in Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy &ndash; A Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015.  They comprise managing and chairing the Export Trade Council (formally the Foreign Trade Council) and convening, chairing, managing and developing Joint Economic Commissions.  The Government published a review of this Strategy on 24 February last.</p><p>  The Export Trade Council (ETC) was established in 2011 in order to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State agencies involved in the promotion of trade, tourism and inward investment.  I am a member of this Council, which is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Joint Economic Commissions are formal intergovernmental bodies that provide a forum for discussing issues that relate to the development of economic and business cooperation and scientific and technological cooperation. </p><p>  Export Trade Missions are an essential part of trade promotion.  Those relating to trade and investment are for the most part prepared and managed by the development agencies under my Department, such as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  They support the long term development of target markets for both trade and investment.  Trade mission activities are based on the specific requirements of companies and sectors involved as well as, of course, on the target market involved.  The objective of each mission, e.g. Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, Education, Innovation etc., influences the form of Ministerial participation, that now frequently involves Ministers from across Government.  My aim is to maximise the potential of these events to bring Irish businesses into direct contact with business opportunities abroad, by targeting sectors and countries where there is significant potential. </p><p>  My Department retains responsibility for Trade Policy including policy within the framework of the EU Common Commercial Policy and the World Trade Organisation.  Discussions on free trade agreements, liberalisation of world trade in the context of the WTO or using other avenues to expand opportunities for our exporters are directly linked to the sectoral enterprise and investment policies being developed by my Department and its<b></b>Agencies.</p></reply>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  There are currently approximately 8,900 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;17.9 million for in 2014.</p><p>  The Government's strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:</p><p>- Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers;</p><p>- A social housing response (Mortgage to Rent);</p><p>- Comprehensive advice to borrowers;</p><p>- Personal Insolvency Reform. </p><p>In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions.  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which explores the various options available to the person and provides sustainable solutions.</p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014. Existing customers are not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme, up to 1st January 2018.  However, it would be expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the Mortgage to Rent scheme.

The payments made to participants on CE, T&uacute;s, Gateway and the Rural Social Scheme have been standardised for some time.</p><p>  T&uacute;s, Gateway and CE are part of a suite of interventions the Department funds and are designed to meet the priorities established by the Government in Pathways to Work.  In terms of up-skilling jobseekers, the Department provides income support for training and education mainly under the Back to Education programme.  This provides for the payment of allowances to enable a jobseeker to undertake full-time education and training at second and third level.  The value of these allowances are broadly similar to those paid under the relevant qualifying scheme (jobseekers allowance or similar).

The major difference is that Parliamentary Question No. 304 (PQ 6461/14) of 11 February 2014 asked me to provide details in relation to <i>contracts awarded</i> since May 2011. Parliamentary Question No. 115 (PQ 12586/14) of 13 March 2014 requested details of <i>payments made</i>   since February 2011.  The responses provided were responses appropriate to the details sought.</p><p>  Some of the apparent difference also relates to the specific request in the first PQ for the <i>full value</i> of certain contracts, i.e. those put in place since May 2011, compared to the request for <i>amounts paid in a given period</i>  , i.e. since February 2011, in the second PQ.</p><p>  In addition, there are a number of recipients listed on PQ 12586/14 that are not included on PQ 6461/14 as the relevant contracts were awarded <i>prior to May 2011</i>  . </p><p>  For example, the contract value for the General Register Office (GRO) maintenance &amp;amp; development project awarded in 2010, and the contract value for SDM (Service Delivery Modernisation) support &amp;amp; maintenance awarded in 2008 are not included in PQ 6461/14.  However payments made since February 2011 in relation to these contracts totalling some &euro;11m are included in PQ 12586/14.</p><p>  Full details of the constituent elements of the two responses are included in the tables below.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the engagement of consultants and external service providers contributes to decision making and policy formulation, and provides valuable support for the Department&rsquo;s service delivery modernisation and reform programmes, and that procurement of consultants and external service providers is compliant with best practice in procurement, governance and realising value for money. <table><tr><th> Contractor</th><th>PQ 12586/14 </th><th>Amount Spent 2011-<br /><br /><br />end Jan 2014 </th><th>PQ 6461/14 </th><th>Contract Value <br /><br /><br />for contracts awarded post <br /><br /><br />May 2011 </th></tr><tr><td>Accenture</td><td>GRO Maintenance &amp;amp;

The Government&rsquo;s introduction of the sovereign annuity initiative provided an option which enables the trustees of a pension scheme to reduce pension scheme liabilities and benefit from the premium available through sovereign annuities over traditional annuities.  I am pleased to see the uptake of sovereign annuities has been strong.  Data from industry indicates that the vast majority of annuities purchased in 2013 were sovereign annuities.  The total premium amount in 2013 was over &euro;400 million which enabled the purchase of approximately &euro;30 million in pensions per annum.  These pensions were in respect of over 1,700 scheme members.  <font color="#2F2F2F">This development is to be welcomed as it facilitates the release of extra funds for scheme members.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Irish pension schemes have the majority of their assets invested outside of Ireland.  As well as providing a mechanism for more prudent investment and a better outcome for scheme members, sovereign annuities deliver a win-win benefit as they ensure the retention of funds within the domestic economy.  This initiative by Government has attracted significant pension fund investment into the economy, with feedback from the NTMA indicating a continuous demand, amounting to &euro;1.377 billion to date, for the amortising bonds used to underwrite sovereign annuities.</font></p></reply>

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County including County Kerry can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.  The provision of universal access to phone services is limited to the provision of such services at fixed locations using fixed line or equivalent technologies.  All citizens are entitled to reasonable access to basic telephone services at fixed locations in accordance with provisions contained in the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and User&rsquo;s Rights) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 337/2011).  Any failure by the universal service provider, currently eircom, to meet reasonable requests for fixed line phone services should be notified to the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent market regulator.  The provision of mobile phone networks and services is undertaken by telecommunications service providers operating in a fully liberalised market under licences provided by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Subject to any statutory consent requirements including planning consent requirements, the design of each mobile network is a matter entirely for them.  I can advise, however, that mobile operators are investing significantly in the Irish market. Following ComReg's succesful multiband spectrum auction, three operators have launched 4G services in Ireland and at least one has announced a major upgrade to its 3G network.  During the preparation of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce report, which concluded its deliberations in 2012, service providers noted the importance of planning and consent processes in facilitating the rollout of infrastructure to support the provision of telecommunications services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services.  Local Authorities have an important role to play in this regard. </p><p>  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:</p><p> - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p> - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country, this map will outline exactly the type of broadband is available in County Kerry. </p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is primarily a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of commercial websites as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p> - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.  Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.  In addition, the recent enactment of legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, will also help the roll-out of high speed broadband as well as facilitating greater competition in the Irish market.</p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

Regular meetings are held between my Department and local authorities under the auspices of the Committee. However, the management of issues relating to unfinished housing developments remain a matter for the individual local authority involved.  Each local authority has appointed an Unfinished Housing Development Co-ordinator; contact details can be found on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website &ndash; </p><p>  Until they are taken in charge by the relevant local authority, both finished and unfinished housing developments remain the responsibility of developers or receivers acting on the instructions of funders acting in possession. It is open to residents of the development in question to seek independent legal advices on the issues arising. It is my Department&rsquo;s understanding that the relevant local authority is engaging with the company in question on this matter.</p><p>  My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative (PSI) in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues in unfinished housing developments. The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5m to local authorities from the funding made available. To date, &euro;3.26m has been drawn down.</p><p>  The Public Safety Initiative provides funding only in instances where a developer has abandoned the development. However, in circumstances where the developer is merely inactive the responsibility for the maintenance and resolution of issues surrounding the development are matters which need to be addressed between the developer and the relevant stakeholders, and my Department has no remit in this regard.</p><p>  Also, Budget 2014 contains a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments. The SRF has been proposed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. It is envisaged that the SRF should be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition. A Local Property Tax waiver applies to t he development in question .     </p><p>  My Department is currently evaluating SRF applications from local authorities. A number of queries have been raised by my Department with local authorities in relation to certain applications. I am conscious of the limited time available to complete SRF projects within the current year and I am hopeful that my Department will be in a position to finalise matters in the coming weeks. I hope that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible. </p></reply>

It is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally, within the legislative framework, including the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter and dog fouling, taking account of its own local circumstances and priorities. Section 16 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986 sets out the powers of dog wardens. In addition, section 28 of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997 provides that a dog warden, within the meaning of the Control of Do gs Act 1986, may issue a notice or on -the- spot fine to an individual believed to have committ ed a prescribed offence under the Act.</p><p>  While my Department does not collate statistics on the number of fines issued by local authorities in relation to specific offences, such as dog fouling offences, data is available under the local authority service indicators report on the number of fines issued generally, along with the number of prosecutions and convictions under the Litter Pollution Acts. The 2012 local authority service indicators report is available at the following link: . Penalties for littering offences are already substantial, ranging from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The maximum fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.   A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.</p><p>  The Data Protection Commissioner has indicated to my Department that actions taken by local authorities in publishing the names and addresses of persons fined or convicted as a result of any littering offence , whether by publication on their websites or by notices published in the local press and paid for by the local authority, would be in breach of the principles of data protection contained in the Data Protection Act 1988 , as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003.</p><p>  I am of the view that there are sufficient penalties in place to deal with the issue of dog fouling when enforced under the L itter P ollution A ct s and I have no plans to introduce further legislation at this time. I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem and educating our young people is key to effecting a long-term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal but ultimately, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter, including in relation to dog fouling.</p></reply>

The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under various Regulations such as the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009, the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009, and most recently in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.

Local authorities are advised to examine each application on its own merits in determining whether an applicant is eligible for a house purchase loan.  House purchase loans are<b></b>not, as a general rule, available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits. However, where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature, and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection, then long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed by the Department of Social Protection or other relevant Government Department. Independent confirmation is required in such circumstances. </p><p>  Family Income Supplement is not considered to be a long term social welfare payment for the purposes of calculating household income in the context of assessing house purchase loan applications. It is a weekly tax-free payment available to employees with children to provide extra financial support to people on low pay. Loan applicants on low incomes are dealt with on a case-by-case basis and can be referred to the Local Authority Credit Committee for a decision.</p></reply>

Clearly, the dramatic increase in volume over those years impacted on the capacity of the administrative system to process them and gave rise to a large volume of cases on hand and to a situation where most cases were taking well over two years to complete. When I came into office there was a backlog of about 22,000 cases on hands. I undertook to address this issue and, in this regard, a major effort has been and continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process applications. Since my appointment, I have made decisions on some 73,000 naturalisation applications.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, as well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. All applications are processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and are submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  Over 70% of all applications are now being decided in under six months, a remarkable achievement given routine applications were taking four times longer even though there were far fewer applications. Approximately 9,600 applications are currently awaiting a decision.</p><p>  The detailed information sought by the Deputy in relation to the years in question is being compiled and will be conveyed to him as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The disclosure is made by the Garda Central Vetting Unit to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  </p><p>  Elements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 relating to the disclosure of convictions are under review at present having regard to a recent judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in (On the Application of) T and others v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester [2013]. The UK Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for old, minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Having considered the judgement in that case, I intend bringing proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act. Given the close relationship between this Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill. The amendment of the Vetting Act will also be done via the Spent Convictions Bill.</p><p>  Until now all records of all criminal convictions have been disclosed by the garda&iacute; when vetting people for various employments. However, in future certain minor offences that are more than seven years old, where the person has not subsequently reoffended, will not be disclosed. In addition, cases of minor offences where charges are struck out will not be disclosed. Consideration is also currently being given to the necessity of disclosing instances where the Court has applied the Probation Act. More serious offences, however, such as all sexual offences, offences against the person, serious motoring offences, firearms offences, robbery, or any offence for which the person is convicted on indictment will continue to be disclosed in all cases.</p><p>  Pending commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 the revisions in approach outlined above will, in the interim be applied on an administrative basis by the Garda Central Vetting Unit. </p></reply>

Section 13(2) of the Army Pension Act 1923 provides that any compensation received from or on behalf of the person alleged to be responsible for the act which caused the wounding may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension, allowance or gratuity awarded.  </p><p>  In this case the person in question was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of a wrist injury sustained while serving in the PDF.  The person in question also instituted civil proceedings and was awarded compensation of &euro;37,457 (&pound;29,500) in respect of the same injury.  The reduction in disability pension was made in consideration of the fact that compensation was awarded &lsquo;on the double&rsquo; in respect of the same disablement.  The (tax free) disability pension awarded is currently payable at the rate of &euro;9,725.17 per year. </p><p>  Compulsory retirement or discharge from the Defence Forces on medical grounds does not give an automatic entitlement to a disability pension and does not affect the rate of disability pension payable.  The rate of disability pension depends on the degree of disablement as assessed by the Army Pensions Board, the independent statutory body appointed to adjudicate on applications.   The Board&rsquo;s principal function is to investigate applications for pensions, allowances and gratuities under the Acts and to report thereon. The Board determines the question of attributability to military service in each case and assesses the degree of disability </p><p>  Broadly speaking, the criteria for awarding a disability pension or gratuity are based on whether the applicant is suffering from a permanent disablement due to a wound/injury or disease which is attributable to his military service at home or abroad, and the percentage degree of that disablement.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the review of the disability pension payable in this case was in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act 1923 and therefore the decision must stand.</p></reply>

After extensive and lengthy consultations during  2009 and 2010,  the then Minister introduced new management arrangements for polyvalent mackerel in November 2010.   Mackerel allocations were made available to vessel owners based on track record from the two best years 2007, 2008, 2009. </p><p>  The policy sets out that 13% of the national Mackerel quota is available to the polyvalent segment as follows:  76.5% of the polyvalent mackerel quota  is allocated to Tier 1 and 21% for Tier 2, the remaining 2.5% is available to cover the artisanal gill net fishermen and under 18m vessels with periodic boat catch limits set usually on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.  Vessels qualified for either of the Tiers on the basis of having caught more than 35% of the mackerel allocated to them in an average of 2 of the reference years.  In order to qualify for Tier 1 allocations, a vessel had to have landed more than an average of 275 tonnes of mackerel per year.   To qualify for a Tier 2 allocation, a vessel had to have landed more than 25 tonnes of mackerel per year.  These quantities were chosen so as to ensure that there is no general loss of fishing opportunities to vessels, based on track record in the period 2007-2009 </p><p>  Given the long and detailed consultation process which went into development of the mackerel policy in recent years, I consider this matter settled and I see no merit in adjusting the allocation ratios as proposed.</p></reply>

This protocol provides that the Committee will comprise representatives from each recognised Producer Organisation (PO), the Irish Fish producers and Exporters Association (IFPEA), the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Department.  The meeting will be chaired by a Department representative. Each of the Producer Organisations (PO) and the IFPEA are represented by a single attendee and in addition each organisation may invite one observer to the meeting.   It is practice that the POs have usually one representative of a fisheries co-operative at these meetings as an invitee.   Where representatives or observers have business interests related to the fishery / quota under discussion, they must advise the meeting of that business interests when giving a view on management issues. </p><p>  Producer organisations,  are officially approved bodies set up by fishery producers under EU Regulation and  play an essential role in supporting the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The POs role involves  guiding their members towards sustainable fishing and aquaculture, helping  them match supplies with market demands, and supporting  them in creating added value. Recognition of PO is governed by Regulation (EU)No 1379/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council &amp;amp; Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1419/2013.  </p><p>It is in the interest of the industry as a whole that appropriately recognised organisations represent their interests to deliver a co-ordinated and cohesive view for the benefit of the industry.  I consider that this would be very difficult  if representation was at the individual level or fragmented amongst a large number of smaller ad hoc representatives groups  .</p></reply>

When Appropriations-in-Aid receipts of just over &euro;22.8 million are taken into account, the net current funding allocated to my Department in 2014 is some &euro;974.3 million.  This level of funding (&euro;997m) represents an increase of over &euro;558 million on the 2013 Estimate of &euro;439 million and the significant investment demonstrates that, while operating within difficult Budgetary constraints, this Government is strongly committed to delivering important reforms and service developments to support children and families. </p><p>  I consider that the estimate provision for my Department will facilitate the delivery of a significant level of public services as well as a number of new policy measures that include:</p><p>-	The establishment of the new Child and Family Agency which took effect on 1st  January 2014. This was a historic development and a significant milestone in the programme of this Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of services to vulnerable children and families. The level of funding allocated to the Agency is over &euro;602m in current funding and &euro;6.8m in capital spending.  The Agency has received development funding of &euro;6.7m in 2014 (&euro;12m in a full year) to support the reform of services. This resource allocation is for the continuing provision of services previously administered by the Health Service Executive, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency. The overall level of funding available, which is significant by any measurement, will help the agency to respond to demand and to the needs of clients.  It will help to improve the level and quality of services and assist in responding to the historic legacy of failings highlighted in the various inquiry reports published in recent years.</p><p>  -	An additional &euro;4 million to support implementation of the Pre-School Quality Agenda which seeks to support high standards through supporting the efforts of providers and their staff in delivering improved and more reliable quality; and to respond to concerns raised by parents;</p><p>  -	An increase of &euro;1.5 million in funding to address child poverty through the new Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme. This will bring to &euro;4 million the State funding to be invested in this initiative in 2014.   The total budget allocation for the programme over the period 2013 &ndash; 2016 is almost &euro;30 million. </p><p>  -	&euro;31m in capital funding to facilitate the continuation of construction work on the new Children Detention School facilities in Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin. The timeline for the project will see the first three residential units available in the third quarter of 2014 and will be prioritised for the transfer of 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, currently in St Patrick's Institution. </p><p>  Other important areas being supported in 2014 are the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which has a funding provision of &euro;175 million. Some 4,300 pre-school services are participating in the programme and approximately 68,000 children are currently benefiting from it. In addition, in excess of &euro;50 million is also being made available to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services by the voluntary youth sector for all young people including those in disadvantaged communities.</p></reply>

It is addressing the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many children and families with the most complex needs.  It is also tasked with developing a role in supporting families more universally by providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function. The emphasis is on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic and care interventions which  are key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families in need. </p><p>  All referrals made to the Child and Family Agency are managed through the Standardisation Business Process. Professional risk analysis is carried out by the duty social worker, supervised by the  team leader of the relevant child welfare and protection team. Every report of concern for the safety and well-being of a child is assessed and required action is identified. </p><p>  In identifying risk it is the professional judgement of the duty social worker to assess if immediate action is required. This is decided based on the information received on the referral, the seriousness of the abuse reported, the likely level of risk to the future safety and welfare of the child and the degree of professional confidence in the information that either the abuse has occurred and is likely to be repeated or that the child is at immediate risk. </p><p>  Where ongoing risk is identified a variety of interventions may be employed through the various systems in place to ensure that children deemed to be at immediate risk are identified and managed accordingly. The level of resource available to the Child and Family Agency is designed to support the approach described above in responding to identified risk and the adequacy of this resource will continue to be the subject of close scrutiny by my Department in consultation with the Agency.</p></reply>

However the answer is not always legislative.</p><p>  It is noted that legislative proposals in France on banning pageants ran into difficulties in light of criticisms regarding the vagueness around the specifics of what types of events were addressed. Pageants can be labelled as &lsquo;talent&rsquo; contests for example.</p><p>  It so encouraging and praiseworthy that each of the hotels approached by Universal Royalty, the company promoting a child beauty pageant, back in September of last year declined the opportunity to host the context. In the interests of children, they turned down the opportunity to make money. They have to be congratulated for that, as does the Irish Hotels Federation for opposing child beauty pageants in Ireland.</p><p>  This is yet another demonstration of voluntary progress; of the culture of cooperation needed.</p><p>  However, I have asked the Department to examine options, to commission an international review of other countries' responses to these issues in order to inform the Government's response, and future actions; and this evening I can confirm that my Department has now commissioned the Centre for Effective Services to undertake this review in 2014.</p><p>  This research project will build on another current research project being conducted by University College Cork; commissioned and funded by my Department through its scholarship programme which is looking at the impact of commercialisation and sexualisation of children in Ireland. This important research is currently undergoing peer review and is expected to be published before the Summer.</p><p>  In 2012, I extended an invitation to the Irish retail sector to respond to increasing concerns about the sexualisation of childrenswear. Retail Ireland, responded to my call and accepted my invitation to bring forward Ireland&rsquo;s first ever guidelines on the &lsquo;responsible retailing of childrenswear&rsquo;.</p><p>  These guidelines are not just about restricting what retailers can sell, but instead provide a more constructive guidance on best practice on a range of issues such as styling, slogans, age-appropriateness, size, labelling and marketing.</p><p>  I believe this code is now playing an important and constructive role in informing future decision-making by retailers and I am happy to report that the number of complaints regarding inappropriate childrenswear have fallen. However I would urge parents to continue to feedback any concerns or complaints, either in-store or by contacting retail@ibec.ie</p><p>  An Coimisium le Rinci Gaelacha, The Irish Dancing Commission, is also to be commended for their introduction of additional rules prohibiting the use of make-up including false eye lashes, the tinted make-up I mentioned, and artificial tanning products for the face. Dancers who are ten years of age or younger may no longer compete using any of these.</p></reply>

The programme aims is to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.</p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training and support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes.   It is covered under the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack delivered to youth organisations.  The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway. MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people, looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.  Mindout adopts a universal mental health promotion approach which has strong links with the &ldquo;Support for all&rdquo; element of the recent guidelines on Mental Health Promotion for Schools published by the HSE, Department of Education and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</p><p>  The Learning Content includes</p><p>  - Expressing Feelings</p><p>  - Coping strategies and resilience</p><p>  - Gender differences in coping behaviour</p><p>  - The importance of social support</p><p>  - Dealing with rejection and depression</p><p>  - Positive self-talk</p><p>  - Seeking help</p><p>  The National Youth Health Programme also offers a Specialist Certificate in Youth Health Promotion.  This programme is accredited by NUIG and adopts a whole organisational approach to health promotion.  It focuses on a holistic model of an individual&rsquo;s health and mental health and reinforces youth work as a valuable setting for mental health promotion.</p><p>  Actions needed to address this issue obviously extend way beyond the remit of my Department. My Department is currently leading the preparation of the new Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework which will represent a new whole-for government approach to addressing issue affecting children and young people including their health, mental health and well being.</p></reply>

One in five teenagers is overweight or obese according to The National Teens Survey. This is of great concern as there are a multitude of short and long-term effects in not only in childhood but also in later life.</p><p>  Overweight and obesity are a public health priority for Minister for Health who has established a Special Action Group on Obesity whom he meets with regularly to progress the obesity prevention agenda.  The Special Action Group on Obesity comprises key stakeholders including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and is chaired by the Department of Health. It is recognised that alone no single initiative will reverse this growing trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  For this reason the Special Action Group is concentrating on a range of measures including actions such as: </p><p>  Calorie posting in restaurants</p><p>  There is strong support for this initiative among the general public and also, in fact, within much of the food industry itself.  Calorie posting has already commenced in a number of establishments and it is envisaged that in the coming months, when the necessary implementation mechanism has been devised it will be further implemented.</p><p>  Healthy Eating Guidelines, including the Food Pyramid</p><p>These were launched on 13 June 2012.  They will help inform people about the food and drink choices required for a healthy lifestyle and set out in plain and simple language the food servings the Irish population need to consume to maintain health and well-being.</p><p>  Marketing of Food and Drink to Children</p><p>  The Department of Health has worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, with regard to the marketing of food and drink to children towards a new Children&rsquo;s Code up to 18 years, to restrict marketing of high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drinks up to 7 pm.</p><p>  Media campaign on preventing childhood obesity</p><p>  In November 2013 a three year media campaign was jointly launches by the Ministers for Health and Children and Youth Affairs which aims to provide parents with practical tips in helping to ensure children and young people maintain a healthy weight. The advertising campaign is backed up by social media and printed resources for parents and also professionals both of whom were closely involved in developing the campaign. Reaction to the first phase has been very positive from parents and the second phase of the campaign is due to start shortly, focusing on increasing physical activity.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that the Hospital will, through the establishment of this managed clinical network with the Coombe, be supported to ensure the provision of improved, safer, patient centred maternity services. </p><p>  In addition to the Portlaoise Report, I have requested that HIQA carry out an investigation in accordance with Section 9 (2) of the Health Act 2007 as well as undertake an immediate assessment of the patient safety culture at Portlaoise Hospital.

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for a medical card. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner. The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines. </p><p>  The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card. </p><p>  Under the legislation, there is no entitlement to a medical card based on having a particular disease or illness (nor has there been previously).  However, if an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis. Where persons submit an application, as a new applicant or a renewal/review, without additional medical documentation and are refused, they will receive a letter giving a calculation of the guideline thresholds and where these have been exceeded. Also, at this stage, they are informed of the option to furnish further medical documentation, to demonstrate medical expenditure related to an illness or disease, in support of their application. </p><p>  Where discretion is exercised with regard to an applicant with an illness or disease, it is the medical costs of that condition on a person's financial situation that is relevant to the assessment for a medical card.  In accordance with the legislation, it is not possible to award a medical card by virtue of an illness or a disease or the severity thereof.</p><p>  Down&rsquo;s Syndrome is covered under the Long Term Illness Scheme for which entitlement applies, irrespective of means. Where persons with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome are not eligible for a medical card following an assessment of their means,  the HSE can provide their full requirements in respect of prescribed medicines and appliances free of charge through this statutory entitlement. Public dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and appliances are also available free of charge to children and in respect of any difficulties identified at child health or school health examinations.</p></reply>

The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review. As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department. This review is due to commence in April 2014 and will be completed by December 2014.</p><p>  The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, &quot;Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth&quot; (FACCT). The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007. In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) which has commenced its pilot phase.</p><p>  The Forum on Fluoridation, established in 2000, reviewed the policy of water fluoridation and recommended in 2002 that it should continue as a public health measure. In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. </p></reply>

This Report examines the policy measures in place to address intentional injury to children by describing the adoption, implementation and enforcement on national level policies addressing intentional injury prevention in over 25 Member States.</p><p>In Ireland, Government policy on deliberate self-harm and suicide prevention is guided by our national strategy <i>Reach Out </i>which makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, reducing stigma and promoting positive mental health, initiatives aimed at helping young men and research.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has primary responsibility for the implementation of <i>Reach Out.</i></p><p>  In 2014, my Department and the HSE have committed to developing a new strategic framework for suicide prevention, building on the comprehensive work delivered under the current strategy.  The framework will present the key priorities to be addressed in the years 2015 - 2018 and will guide and be supported by robust implementation plans which will specify agreed deliverables, outcomes, and resource implications, lines of accountability and governance structures.  </p><p>The aim of the new strategy will be to support population health approaches and interventions that will assist in reducing the loss of life through suicide.  This renewed focus will provide for improved coordination and integration of services to ensure that pathways of care for persons at risk of suicide or in suicidal crisis can be accessible, acceptable and available.  The new framework,  which is expected to be published in late 2014, will build upon and learn from the experience of implementing <i>Reach Out, </i>which continue to be relevant, and give a more short to medium-term focus to implementation.  The recommendations from the <i>National Action to Address Child Intentional Injury 2014 Report </i>  will also be considered in the context of the development of the new framework. </p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government, and this is reflected in the significant investment in suicide prevention and mental health services generally in recent years.</p></reply>
