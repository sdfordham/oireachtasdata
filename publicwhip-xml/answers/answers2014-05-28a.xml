Ireland works bilaterally and through the EU and UN to ensure that human rights are respected in Myanmar/Burma.  Earlier this month, EU Foreign Ministers approved the establishment of a formal EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue.  The first such Dialogue took place in Myanmar on 20th May.  It was co-chaired by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights and the Myanmar Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and covered major issues of concern with regard to human rights.</p><p>  In March, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted an EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, and urged the Government of Myanmar to step up its efforts to put an end to such remaining human rights violations and abuses.  The resolution reiterated the Council&rsquo;s serious concern about the situation of the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine State.  Also in March, the UN called on the Myanmar authorities to fully investigate current and historical human rights violations, and urged the government, with the support of the UN, to put in place a comprehensive protection and service response for survivors.  In April, Ireland was involved in organising with several NGOs an event at UN Headquarters in New York that focused on sexual violence in Myanmar.  It featured interventions from a Burmese woman human rights activist, Naw K&rsquo;nyaw Paw, and Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN, David Donoghue.</p><p>  Ireland and our international partners recognise that complex challenges remain in Myanmar and will continue to urge its government to address human rights abuses.  We will press for the Myanmar government to implement its commitment to open a local country office of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights which would have a mandate for monitoring and reporting on human rights issues.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-28a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052800061#WRA00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 20 together.</p><p>  As noted in a  previous reply, this is an issue to which I accord a very high priority.  I am conscious of the difficulties experienced by Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States, and have met and spoken with many of them on my working visits there, and also with the various groups who lobby on their behalf. Immigration reform and the challenges faced by our undocumented remain central to our bilateral engagement with the United States.  I raise the issue consistently in my meetings, telephone calls and written correspondence with senior US political contacts.  I have instructed Ambassador Anderson and her team, working with the Irish-American lobby groups who have already put in such a great effort, to continue their lobbying of members of Congress to seize every opportunity to make immigration reform a reality.    </p><p>  The issue was also discussed extensively during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Washington DC in March.  In addition to substantive discussion of the issues with President Obama and Vice President Biden, the Taoiseach also discussed the prospects for progress with a range of other members of Congress including Speaker John Boehner; Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee which has responsibility for immigration legislation in the House; Congressman Paul Ryan; the Congressional Friends of Ireland; and Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversaw the passage of the Senate&rsquo;s comprehensive immigration reform bill last June.  The Taoiseach called in the strongest possible terms for Congress to show leadership and deal with the immigration issue now.   </p><p>    While we have been encouraged by feedback from both Democrats and Republicans indicating that there is now a growing momentum for reform, it remains difficult to assess exactly when and how this might occur, not least in view of the upcoming mid-term U.S. Congressional elections.  The most recent indications suggest that there may be some prospects for another push for immigration reform activity at House of Representatives level during the June/July period.  However, the situation is continuously evolving and any predictions need to be made with caution.</p><p>  In this context, I intend to travel to Washington DC next month for a series of further meetings with key contacts on Capitol Hill as well as with representatives of Irish-American lobby groups.  Although much uncertainty still remains as to how events in the U.S. Congress will unfold, it is important that we continue to demonstrate at a high political level the importance we attach to progress being made on this vital issue and that we position ourselves to best advantage on behalf of Irish people and their families who are directly affected.</p></reply>

I also refer the Deputies to the written answers I gave yesterday to Questions Nos. 55 and 64 in relation to these matters.</p><p>  If the Deputies wish I can repeat my answer to that question: </p><p>  Policing, prisons and overall criminal justice policy have been the responsibility of the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland, David Ford MLA, since the devolution of Policing and Justice in 2010.  The Irish government has a close and excellent working relationship with Minister Ford and his Department and co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI to combat criminal and terrorist activity is excellent.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs I very much value my engagement with Minister Ford and our exchanges cover a wide range of issues.  Since 2010, the Irish Government&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to ensure the justice systems which are in place are robust and consistent with the principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and the other agreements for which we are co-guarantors.</p><p>  Prison policy forms a central part of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice&rsquo;s remit and an executive agency, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, implements prison policy in that jurisdiction.  A Prisoner Ombudsman is also appointed by Minister Ford and the Ombudsman operates entirely independently of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  The Prisoner Ombudsman and his team investigate complaints from prisoners and visitors to prisoners in Northern Ireland as well as deaths in custody.  I wholeheartedly agree with Minister Ford&rsquo;s analysis that delivery of a reformed justice system has a major part to play in building a more positive future for Northern Ireland.  I commend the work underway to give effect to the far reaching recommendations related to prison reform in Northern Ireland contained in Dame Anne Owers 2011 report.  The Government&rsquo;s position continues to be that the full implementation of all of the recommendations of the Owers Report remains the most effective way to ensure that conditions within all prisons in Northern Ireland are of an acceptable standard.  Minister Ford and I have discussed this and are of one mind on this matter.</p><p>  A central aspect of my engagement with Minister Ford is the Irish government&rsquo;s absolute support for the men and women of the PSNI and the Northern Ireland Prison service in their work to support the rule of law and a new beginning for justice in Northern Ireland.  The men and women in these essential public services face persistent and severe threats to their lives and wellbeing from those who are enemies of the peace process.  People who threaten and have acted to murder harm and threaten police and prison officers act in defiance of the criminal law.  They also defy the sovereign will of the Irish people who freely endorsed the principles and values of Good Friday Agreement in an all island referendum just over 16 years ago on May 22 1998.  I call on all the Irish republicans who try to justify threats against public servants to listen to the people.  It is long since past time to end violence, the door is open to join the rest of us who seek change through dialogue, persuasion and the ballot box.  The Irish people have chosen peace &ndash; you should heed their will. </p><p>  As previously indicated in this House, the arrangements agreed for the devolution of Policing and Justice in 2010, include a role for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in national security matters.  I am aware that such prisoner cases have had resonance historically in communities here and abroad.  My officials in the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast continue to monitor prisoner cases which arise from the exercise of such competences.  As the House will know, I have on a number of occasions raised the Government&rsquo;s perspective on humanitarian issues in certain cases directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  Such issues are part of my regular and comprehensive discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, as we work together to guarantee that peace, policing and  power sharing is supported by all of us, all of the time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-28a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052800061#WRA01300"><p>In June 2013 the Passport Office in Molesworth Street moved to a service whereby customers book, via a simple web based system, guaranteed time slots before travelling into the office.  The public have responded very well to this new arrangement and in particular are very welcoming of the fact that the many hours previously spent queuing in the office has been eliminated.  Customers are now in and out having lodged their application in approximately 10 minutes.  From the customer perspective, the change has removed the necessity to queue for many hours.  Additionally the office has extended the public opening hours from 09.30-16.30 to 09.00 -17.00.  Over 200 people per day avail of this service during our peak times.</p><p>  A similar service commenced operation in Cork Office earlier this month.  The primary  purpose of these public offices is to accommodate those with urgent travel needs.  However the vast majority of applications annually are made by Passport Express through some 1,000 post offices across the country and some 70 post offices in Northern Ireland.  This means that no Irish citizen on the island need travel a significant distance to renew a passport.  The attraction and popularity of this service is reflected in the fact that so far this year over 93% of all persons applying for their passports in the State have used Passport Express.  I am satisfied that the range of service options meets the current demands of passport applicants.</p></reply>

In particular, the widespread use of landmines during the conflict has held back agricultural development in some areas.  A drought during the 2012-2013 agricultural cycle continues to have an impact on Angola&rsquo;s southern provinces.  It is estimated that 1.8 million people in six provinces were affected.  The effects of drought on food supplies have had a significant impact on the population&rsquo;s nutritional health.  Last month, the Government of Angola reported over 400,000 people affected in provinces in western areas. </p><p>  I discussed the situation in Angola during a meeting with the Secretary of State for Cooperation, Ms. Angela Braganca, at the meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation in Mexico on 17 May.  The EU is working to develop long term solutions to assist Angola in diversifying its economy, especially its agriculture sector.  Under the 10th European Development Fund, the EU allocated a total of &euro;227.9 million to Angola, including funds for rural development, agriculture, food security and demining.  Ireland has also made an important contribution.  Between 2010 and 2013 just under &euro;2.6 million was provided by Irish Aid to civil society organisations working in Angola, including Christian Aid Ireland, Tr&oacute;caire and Concern. </p><p>  We will continue to work with our partners at the EU, the UN and in all other appropriate fora to ensure that humanitarian needs of the Angolan people are addressed effectively.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-28a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052800061#WRA01700"><p>The Government remains deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and has emphasised the importance of seeking a negotiated political settlement.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>Let me begin by welcoming the holding of Presidential elections in Ukraine on Sunday and the election in the first round of Petro Poroshenko.  While there were difficulties in holding the elections in Eastern Ukraine owing to the security situation, elsewhere millions of ordinary citizens exercised their democratic right in choosing the future direction of their country.  I hope that this represents an important stage on the path towards the stabilisation of Ukraine and the consolidation of an inclusive, representative and peaceful future.  This hope was reflected in the consideration of Ukraine at the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government held yesterday evening.</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the constructive role played in the election in Ukraine by the 17 Irish observers who have been deployed under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  EU Heads of State and Government on 6 March set out a calibrated, three-phase roadmap in relation to targeted measures against the Russian Federation in the absence of steps to de-escalate the situation.  They also endorsed the decision of Foreign Ministers on 3 March to suspend talks with Russia on visa matters and on a New Agreement, both stated priorities of the Russian Government. </p><p>Following the holding of the illegal referendum in Crimea on 16 March, the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) implemented the second phase of measures involving the imposition of travel restrictions and an asset freeze against 21 Russian and Ukrainian individuals involved in undermining Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  That number has since been progressively increased to 61 individuals, both Russian and Ukrainian.  At the last Foreign Affairs Council on 12 May, in the light of developments and in the absence of steps towards de-escalation, Ministers widened the criteria allowing individuals and entities to be subject to restrictive measures and imposed sanctions for the first time on two energy companies based in Crimea whose ownership has been transferred contrary to Ukrainian law.  Ireland fully supports the carefully targeted and measured approach adopted by the EU and has taken the necessary internal steps to implement the sanctions.    </p><p>The May Foreign Affairs Council noted that the preparatory work by the Commission and Member States is underway on possible targeted measures, known as Phase Three measures in the trade and economic spheres, as requested by the European Council in March, so that further steps can be taken should events require.  In that regard, the European Union is paying particular attention to all parties&rsquo; attitude and behaviour towards the holding of free and fair Presidential elections when deciding about possible future measures.  While I very much hope that we will not be faced with an escalation which would necessitate a move to Phase Three, the EU is committed to taking decisive action should it be required.</p></reply>

The number of fatalities surpasses an estimated 150,000 people.  There are now over 9.3 million people within Syria who are in need of immediate life-saving support, and a further 2.8 million Syrian refugees require assistance in neighbouring countries.  The revised UN response plan for Syria and the refugee populations envisages US$6.5 billion dollars in total for operations in 2014, of which approximately 25% has been provided by the international community to date.  This represents the largest humanitarian appeal in the history of the UN.</p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis.  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, I announced Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of a further &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance at the Second International Humanitarian Pledging Conference for Syria and region in Kuwait on January 15th 2014.  This additional pledge brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding commitment in the period 2011 to 2014 to &euro;26.011 million.  I have already approved the release of &euro;9 million towards our pledge, bringing our contribution to over &euro;23 million.</p><p>  Ireland has focused our humanitarian aid through trusted NGO partners, as well as to key UN partners and the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement - agencies capable of delivering impartial assistance to large numbers of beneficiaries.  These agencies also play a key role in supporting the host governments in neighbouring countries to provide assistance to the refugee populations.  This funding has supported the provision of water, food, shelter and vital medicines to internally displaced persons within Syria and also to refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries, particularly Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon.  We will continue to provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.</p><p>  Ireland has consistently matched our material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis, and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access.  We have called for all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians.  Ireland is firmly of the view that Syria&rsquo;s neighbouring states cannot and should not be shouldering the burden of hosting the influx of Syrian refugees alone.  It is for this reason that much of our support has been targeted at supporting both citizens displaced within Syria and refugees across the wider region, as well as to assist the communities hosting refugees in neighbouring states.  Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief, as well as for the full and immediate implementation by all parties to the conflict of UN Security Council Resolution 2139 on humanitarian assistance in Syria.</p></reply>

I am also appalled by the reported abduction of a further 11 girls on 4 May.  Through our development policies and programmes, Ireland is a strong supporter of the rights of women and girls, and in particular the right of girls to education.   </p><p>  I have given my full support to the demands of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, and the High Representative of the European Union, Catherine Ashton, that the girls be released and that those responsible be brought to justice.  I welcome the support now being provided to the Nigerian authorities from a number of our EU partners and from the US, to help find the missing schoolgirls.  I also welcome the decision on 22 May by the UN Security Council Al Qaida Sanctions Committee to impose financial sanctions and an arms embargo on Boko Haram.  The primary responsibility to secure the safe release of the school girls rests with the Nigerian authorities.  I urge the Government of Nigeria to take all appropriate steps to protect their citizens and to ensure that the girls can return safely to their families, and to education.  </p><p>  At its meeting in Brussels on 12 May, the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions expressing the EU&rsquo;s concern at the recent terrorist attacks in northern Nigeria and the suffering caused to the population.  The Council strongly condemned the abduction of the schoolgirls and called for their immediate and unconditional release.  It underlined the EU&rsquo;s readiness to support the Nigerian authorities in the resolution of this despicable crime and their ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism in all its forms, in full respect of human rights.  The EU is already supporting the Nigerian authorities to strengthen their capacity to provide security and combat terrorism.  An EU support programme to strengthen the investigation and prosecution of terrorist suspects will begin later this month.  It will include EU technical assistance to counter violent extremism and radicalisation.  </p><p>  Our Embassy in Abuja is working closely with our EU partners and others on the ground and maintaining contact with the Nigerian authorities in their efforts to locate and free the missing schoolgirls.  Officials from my Department have also been in contact with the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin to express concern at the ongoing situation and to request regular updates on the actions by the Nigerian authorities to recover the abducted schoolgirls. </p><p>  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2014, Ireland highlighted attacks by Boko Haram during discussions with the UN Special Representatives for Violence against Children and Children and Armed Conflict.  Our objective was to draw attention to the ongoing trend of attacks on education around the world and to highlight the importance of ensuring that the right of children to education is upheld during and after conflict.</p></reply>

The report indicates a 2% rise in cases of minors held in solitary confinement, which is clearly unwelcome.  Children in custody should be allowed to be accompanied by adult family members.  I have paid particular attention to the incidence and conditions of detention of Palestinian children.  My view is quite simple: Palestinian children should enjoy the same protections under the law which Israel rightly considers appropriate for Israeli children, and in conformity with international standards.</p><p>Ireland has repeatedly drawn attention to concerns with regard to the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, including minors.  At the Universal Peer Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in October 2013, Ireland recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that Israel end night arrests of children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement against minors, and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation.  These serious concerns were also among those raised by Ireland in its statement under agenda item 7 on &lsquo;the human rights situation in Palestine&rsquo; at the 25<sup>th</sup>session of the Human Rights Council in March.  In addition Ireland raises its concerns bilaterally, both with the Israeli Embassy in Dublin and with the Israeli authorities in Israel, at every appropriate opportunity.  Finally, Ireland provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing these issues to light.  We have seen some improvements in treatment of minors in detention, but much more remains to be done.</p><p>It is right that Israel should be held to appropriate standards in dealing with civilians under its military occupation, especially minors.  However, it is only right also to note that Israel is not alone in giving rise to such concerns.  Similar or worse treatment of persons in detention could be reported from many other countries in the region and elsewhere. </p><p>The position of Marwan Barghouti is a separate issue.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 27 (15397/14) on 3 April last.</p></reply>

While there were difficulties in holding the elections in Eastern Ukraine owing to the security situation, elsewhere millions of ordinary citizens exercised their democratic right in choosing the future direction of their country.  I hope that this represents an important stage on the path towards the stabilisation of Ukraine and the consolidation of an inclusive, representative and peaceful future.  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the role played by the 17 Irish observers who have been deployed under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  </p><p>From the outset, the European Union has played an important role in efforts to facilitate a resolution to the crisis in Ukraine.  In addition to its scheduled meetings, the EU Foreign Affairs Council has met twice in extraordinary session to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the EU Heads of State and Government also have discussed Ukraine in extraordinary session as well as during the regular meetings of the European Council.  The Heads of State and Government discussed the crisis again yesterday evening and considered prospects for progress following Sunday&rsquo;s elections.  <font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>For its part, the European Commission has also been actively engaged. On 13 May, President Barroso and members of the Commission met with Prime Minister Yatsenyuk and members of the Ukrainian government in Brussels.  As the President of the Commission stated, the joint meeting is part of the EU&rsquo;s continued support for a stable, sovereign, democratic and peaceful Ukraine.  President Barroso and the Prime Minister signed a new &ldquo;State Building Contract&rdquo; programme worth &euro;355 million, plus &euro;10 million to support civil society, which will help the government to address short-term economic stabilisation needs and implement governance reforms aimed at promoting inclusive socio-economic development.  The joint meeting in Brussels was followed up with a visit to Kiev by Commissioner Fule on 16 May.</p><p>At its most recent meeting earlier this month, the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) reaffirmed the European Union&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and called upon the Russian Federation to do likewise.  The Council reiterated the EU&rsquo;s strong condemnation of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol in March and regretted the presence of President Putin at the military parade in Sevastopol on 9 May.  The FAC reconfirmed the EU&rsquo;s full commitment to the Geneva Joint Statement of 17 April on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all.  In light of the recent developments and in the absence of any steps towards de-escalation, the Council agreed to expand the criteria allowing individuals and entities to be subject to restrictive measures and moved to impose sanctions against a further thirteen named individuals as well as two energy companies in Crimea.</p><p>The EU has expressed alarm at the continued efforts by pro-Russian separatists to destabilise Eastern and Southern Ukraine and has been clear that it will not recognise the illegitimate and illegal &ldquo;referenda&rdquo; in Donetsk and Luhansk.  The FAC conclusions call for a thorough investigation into the tragic events in Odessa on 2 May and for all those responsible to be brought to justice.  The EU encourages the Ukrainian authorities to maintain their measured approach in pursuing law and order operations and calls on all sides to the conflict to contribute further to reducing tensions. Ireland regrets the loss of all life in Ukraine.</p><p>I strongly welcome the beginning of direct intra-Ukrainian talks in the framework of Ukraine&rsquo;s &lsquo;national dialogue&rsquo;.  The first round table took place in Kiev on 14 May with a second round on 17 May in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv.  The series of round tables brings together national lawmakers, government figures and regional officials and is in line with the &lsquo;roadmap&rsquo; proposed by the Swiss Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE.  In common with our EU partners, Ireland hopes that the roundtables can serve to build confidence and lead to a stabilisation of the situation allowing for a negotiated, peaceful and inclusive settlement to the crisis.</p></reply>

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), there is a serious risk of famine later this year unless adequate humanitarian assistance can be delivered to those most in need.  This unthinkable prospect can still be avoided providing humanitarian agencies are allowed access before it is too late.  It is absolutely critical to stop the fighting and remove any obstacles preventing the delivery of life-saving assistance.</p><p>  Since the South Sudanese Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak on 15 May in Juba, Central Equatoria, the reported cholera caseload has doubled every day.  New cases have been reported in recent days in two additional States, Jonglei and Upper Nile.  After the first case was confirmed in Juba, more than 130 additional cases are now being treated.  There are three confirmed deaths with dozens of children among the affected.  In response to the cholera outbreak, UNICEF has supported the establishment of a Cholera Treatment Centre at the Juba Teaching Hospital.  It is also providing life-saving supplies, including medicines, protective gear and equipment, and is expanding preventive measures to halt further spread across the country.</p><p>  At the recent South Sudan pledging conference in Oslo, Ireland pledged &euro;2million to support life saving work of UN and NGO partners in the country.  Given the seriousness of the crisis and the urgent needs of innocent civilians, Ireland is providing &euro;1.36 million to our NGO partners in South Sudan to provide healthcare and protection to vulnerable women and children.  In addition, Ireland is also providing &euro;500,000 to support the WFP&rsquo;s work in South Sudan and &euro;200,000 to assist South Sudanese refugees who have fled to Uganda.  This funding of over &euro;2 million brings our total contribution this year to approximately &euro;5 million.  This assistance is saving lives.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort both within South Sudan and for South Sudanese refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

In its wake, we are witnessing an unprecedented catastrophe for the Syrian people.  Latest estimates from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggest that over 160,000 people have now been killed.  More than 2.7 million Syrians have sought refuge in neighbouring countries and more than 9 million people are either internally displaced or in urgent need of assistance within Syria.</p><p>  Ireland deeply regrets the failure earlier this year of the Geneva II talks, largely due to the Assad regime&rsquo;s obstruction, and fully supports efforts to reinvigorate this process.  I reiterate that only a political solution can bring an end to this horrific conflict and the Geneva principles remain the best basis for doing this.  I also wish to pay tribute to Joint Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, who has announced his intention to stand down after two years in the role.  It is equally critical that there be no impunity for the appalling crimes perpetrated against the civilian population of Syria.</p><p>  Last week, Ireland, along with our 27 EU Partners and a number of UN member states, co-sponsored a draft Resolution formally requesting the UN Security Council to refer the conflict in Syria to the International Criminal Court. I t is regrettable that insufficient consensus on this vital issue existed within the Council, resulting in the draft Resolution ultimately being vetoed.  I also announced last week additional funding of &euro;5 million towards addressing the urgent humanitarian needs within Syria.  This will be channelled through trusted UN partners and the International Red Cross Movement to help provide food, shelter, medical services, and to help protect women and children.  This brings to &euro;9 million our funding to the Syrian crisis to date this year, and to &euro;26 million Ireland&rsquo;s overall funding commitment from 2011 to the end of 2014.</p></reply>

In my ongoing contacts with the British government and with the Northern Ireland Executive, I continue to stress the importance of progressing implementation of all outstanding aspects of the Agreements.</p><p>I welcome the report agreed at the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary in Dublin on 31 March 2014<b></b>on the implementation of the Good Friday and St Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement and which calls on all parties to the Agreements &lsquo;<i>to maintain momentum to ensure that all outstanding provisions are implemented in their totality</i>&rsquo;.  I continue to urge all the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland can be based.</p><p>I support the establishment of a Civic Forum which would provide for a broad range of voices on community relations and stimulate informed public debate in relation to key societal challenges.  On my regular visits to Northern Ireland, I continue the practice of engaging with civil society representatives.  In the context of the North South Ministerial Council, most recently at our Plenary Meeting on 8 November 2013, the Government expressed support for the re-establishment of the Civic Forum as a valuable and, as yet, unimplemented provision of the Good Friday Agreement.    </p><p>I am firmly of the view that an Irish Language Act should be introduced in Northern Ireland.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity in Northern Ireland.  In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act and to working with the Northern Ireland Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland has been a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland including those involved in cross-community Irish language activity.  I will continue to press in my discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive the urgent need to address this issue and to legislate for an Irish Language Act.  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor this matter in their ongoing contacts with the Northern Ireland Office. </p><p>I met with Dr Haass on 23 May when he visited Dublin after his visit to London on 22 May.  We share the view that progress in the Party Leaders Talks is urgently needed.  I remain convinced that the best way forward for dealing with important issues such as parades, flag and identity issues and dealing with the past is the early, successful conclusion of these talks.  Maintaining the status quo in relation to these issues is not a feasible or satisfactory option for anyone.  I believe that there is a window of opportunity to reach agreement before the summer and I will continue to encourage the NI parties over the coming weeks towards that end.  The British and the US government agree progress on these issues is needed urgently.</p><p>Progress in these talks is primarily a matter for the Party Leaders.  However, the Irish government continues to encourage and support this process in every possible way.  I have remained in close contact with the Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers, with regard to full implementation of the Agreements as well as further progress towards an agreement in the political talks.  I will meet the Secretary of State tomorrow when she is scheduled to visit Dublin.</p></reply>

In Israel, which is an established state and party to most of the relevant international instruments, these standards should apply to all persons imprisoned by Israel, be they in Israel or in occupied territory, be they citizens or not.  The same standards should be applied by the Palestinian Authority, which is building a state which we hope will aspire to the highest standards.  And the same should be expected of the de facto Hamas authorities in Gaza, who claim to be a legitimate government.</p><p>  We have discussed many times in the Oireachtas the many causes for concern that these standards are not fully met.  In some cases this reflects the general need in the broader region to improve standards of human rights protections, in some cases it relates to the specific circumstances of the conflict in the area.  Ireland and our EU partners work in these cases, as we do elsewhere, to encourage and press the parties to adhere fully to international standards.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the difficulties experienced by Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States, and I have met and spoken with many of them on my working visits there, and also with the various groups who lobby on their behalf.  Immigration reform and the challenges faced by our undocumented remain central to our bilateral engagement with the United States.  I raise the issue consistently in meetings, telephone calls and written correspondence with senior US political contacts.  I have instructed Ambassador Anderson and her team, working with the Irish - American lobby groups who have already put in such a great effort, to continue their lobbying of members of Congress to seize every opportunity to make immigration reform a reality.    </p><p>  The issue was also discussed extensively during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Washington DC in March.  In addition to substantive discussion of the issues with President Obama and Vice President Biden, the Taoiseach also discussed the prospects for progress with a range of other members of Congress including Speaker John Boehner; Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee which has responsibility for immigration legislation in the House; Congressman Paul Ryan; the Congressional Friends of Ireland; and Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversaw the passage of the Senate&rsquo;s comprehensive immigration reform bill last June.  The Taoiseach called in the strongest possible terms for Congress to show leadership and deal with the immigration issue now.   </p><p>    While we have been encouraged by feedback from both Democrats and Republicans indicating that there is now a growing momentum for reform, it remains difficult to assess exactly when and how this might occur, not least in view of the upcoming mid-term U.S. Congressional elections.  The most recent indications suggest that there may be some prospects for another push for immigration reform activity at House of Representatives level during the June/July period.  However, the situation is continuously evolving and any predictions need to be made with caution.  In this context, I intend to travel to Washington DC next month for a series of further meetings with key contacts on Capitol Hill as well as with representatives of Irish - American lobby groups.</p><p>  Although much uncertainty still remains as to how events in the U.S. Congress will unfold, it is important that we continue to demonstrate at a high political level the importance we attach to progress being made on this vital issue and that we position ourselves to best advantage on behalf of Irish people and their families who are directly affected.</p></reply>

Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world.  We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015.</p><p>  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements.  The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council.  The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments.  Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance.  Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011.  The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it.  We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.  Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training).  Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported.  Irish Aid, the aid programme operated by my Department, has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</p><p>  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

US Secretary of State Kerry has correctly, in my view, called on the two sides to reflect on the progress achieved to date, the possibility of reaching an agreement, and the perils of failure.It is not anticipated that the United States will in the immediate future attempt to restart the talks, but I hope that they will be willing, and able, to make such an effort again in the not too distant future.  But the US cannot make peace for the parties: it is essential that they grasp the opportunity before them.  Ireland and our EU partners will continue to encourage both Israel and the Palestinians to re-engage seriously and also encourage the continued positive support of the Arab nations for a peace agreement. </p><p>  While both sides have genuine concerns and fears, and both may have made mistakes, in our view the primary responsibility lies on Israel to actively seek to end its long occupation of the Palestinian territory and people.  I believe the EU should be more active in making clear that the continuing status quo of the occupation is not an option.</p></reply>

I hope that the negotiations underway in Havana, Cuba will bring an end to a long conflict in Colombia which has caused much suffering.  Colombia&rsquo;s peace process is also supported by the European Union and the wider international community.  I welcome the announcement on 16th May last that the negotiators in Havana have now reached provisional agreement on their agenda item dealing with illicit drugs.  This means that three areas of the negotiations are now subject to provisional agreement: land reform, political participation and illicit drugs.  As noted in the EU statement concerning the progress announced this month, the drugs trade has weakened political and social structures in Colombia for too long, fuelling insecurity and causing suffering.  Dismantling the drugs economy will benefit the entire region and enable Colombia to reap the full advantages of peace and security.  We are therefore encouraged by the reports of consensus reached on this important issue.</p><p>  The UN Secretary General has commended the parties to the talks for this recent development and encourages them to maintain momentum in the peace process.

Ireland will continue to follow closely developments on the Colombian peace process and to support a negotiated solution to the conflict in Colombia.</p></reply>

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), there is a serious risk of famine later this year unless adequate humanitarian assistance can be delivered to those most in need.  This unthinkable prospect can still be avoided providing humanitarian agencies are allowed access before it is too late. It is absolutely critical to stop the fighting and remove any obstacles preventing the delivery of life-saving assistance.</p><p>  Since the South Sudanese Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak on 15 May in Juba, Central Equatoria, the reported cholera caseload has doubled every day.  New cases have been reported in recent days in two additional States, Jonglei and Upper Nile.  After the first case was confirmed in Juba, more than 395 cholera cases have now been recorded as of 22 May.  There are now 14 confirmed deaths with dozens of children among the affected.  In response to the cholera outbreak, UNICEF has supported the establishment of a Cholera Treatment Centre at the Juba Teaching Hospital.  It is also providing life-saving supplies, including medicines, protective gear and equipment, and is expanding preventive measures to halt further spread across the country.</p><p>  At last week&rsquo;s South Sudan pledging conference, hosted by Norway in cooperation with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, international donors pledged more than US$600 million in aid, aimed at preventing famine and upholding human rights in the country.  This is about half of the funding required (US$1.26 billion) to allow for the provision of vital nutrition supplies, water and child protection services.  Ireland pledged &euro;2million at the conference to support life saving work of UN and NGO partners in the country.  Given the seriousness of the crisis and the urgent needs of innocent civilians, Ireland is providing &euro;1.36 million to our NGO partners in South Sudan to provide healthcare and protection to vulnerable women and children.  In addition, Ireland is also providing &euro;500,000 to support the WFP&rsquo;s work in South Sudan and &euro;200,000 to assist South Sudanese refugees who have fled to Uganda.  This funding of over &euro;2 million brings our total contribution this year to approximately &euro;5 million.  This assistance is saving lives.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort both within South Sudan and for South Sudanese refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

Ireland, together with our EU and UN partners, closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, including human rights situations of key concern on the African continent.  This is conducted on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, concerns about human rights violations are made known to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p>  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements.  The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.</p><p>  Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council.  The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments.  Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance.  Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011.  The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.   Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it.  We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of African and other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.</p><p>  The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  Such dialogues are carried out on a regular basis with countries both in Africa and in other parts of the world.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.</p><p>  Ireland and its EU partners have also been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of situations, including those arising from situations of armed conflict in Africa, and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p><p>  Ireland has also consistently taken the lead for the EU in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.</p><p>  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, the Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, supports concrete actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions (in particular through legal training).  Legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses are also supported. </p><p>  The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

Ireland continues to support the consolidation of peace and democracy in the countries of the Western Balkans, as they introduce reforms in preparation for EU membership.  The EU enlargement process is founded on the Copenhagen criteria, which reflect the EU&rsquo;s founding values: peace, democracy, the rule of law, respect for fundamental rights, and a functioning market economy.</p><p>  Through the enlargement process, the EU actively supports the consolidation of peace and democracy by strengthening democratic institutions and ensuring inclusive processes that support these institutions and reinforce core democratic principles and common EU values.  The EU works to encourage a stronger role for civil society, as well further progress with electoral, parliamentary and public administration reforms, including the professionalisation and depoliticisation of the civil service.  For example, in the period 2007-2013, over &euro;30 million pre-accession assistance has been provided to enhance the capacity of such institutions as national parliamentary assemblies, ombudsmen and national audit bodies.  In the same period, civil society organisations were supported with almost &euro;190 million from the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA), as well as by over &euro;35 million from the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR).</p><p>  We in Ireland also remain fully engaged with the Western Balkans region.  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Paschal Donohoe, has recently visited both Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to express our continued support for their efforts to advance on their respective EU paths.  Both he and I also met with the Foreign Minister of Kosovo when he visited Dublin in January.  We discussed the progress that Kosovo has made as well as the challenges that remain and assured him of our on-going support for his country. </p><p>  Together with our EU counterparts, Ireland will remain fully engaged while supporting the countries of the Western Balkans as they undertake the necessary reforms, especially democratic reforms, and prepare for EU membership.</p></reply>

These codes had a lifespan of 50 days and it was brought to Revenue's attention earlier this year that the time limit was too short and that as a result dealers were experiencing delays in registering camper vans.  Following a review, Revenue has extended the period of validity of these codes to 150 days.   </p><p>The Commissioners have informed me that any dealer with questions about valuation codes for camper vans and their online registration should contact the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Central Vehicle Office, Rosslare Harbour, Rosslare, Co.

As part of the handover of responsibility, Revenue received the HHC database from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and carried out a comprehensive data matching exercise with its own LPT Property Register.  The data matching exercise produced a list of properties in respect of which the HHC did not appear to be paid.</p><p>  Once the 'unpaid' cases were identified, Revenue announced a compliance campaign including a six week window to 31 March to allow people get both their HHC and LPT affairs in order.  The six week window included a commitment that interest and penalties would not be applied against any person who met their obligations during that timeframe.  The window and the consequences of continued non-compliance were very extensively advertised on both national and local media outlets and many people availed of the opportunity to bring their property tax affairs up to date. </p><p>  On 17 April 2014, Revenue began writing to the owners of approximately 274,000 properties who did not bring their affairs up to date during the six week window.  The notices clearly warned of the consequences of continued non-compliance and outlined the steps that needed to be taken in regard to making payment or updating the records where no payment was due on foot of exemptions/waivers.  Since assuming responsibility for HHC Revenue has received payments in respect 112,000 properties, of which 102,000 were received since the compliance programme started.  Revenue has also received in excess of 70,000 items of correspondence since the compliance programme started, of which approximately 30,000 remain to be answered. </p><p>  Revenue expects to have the correspondence backlog cleared in the next few weeks and be in a position to commence debt recovery action against property owners who have still not paid at that point.  The actions to be deployed will include mandatory deduction from employment income for PAYE workers, or from occupational pensions or certain Government payments where appropriate.  Actions applicable in the case of self-assessed taxpayers, some of which have already been deployed, include withholding of Tax Clearance certification, surcharges on Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax returns and withholding/offset of any other tax refunds.  Revenue will also deploy its standard enforcement options including referral to a Sheriff or Solicitor for collection or Attachment where it is appropriate to do so.  Interest on late payment, at a rate of 0.0219% per day, may also be included in any enforcement action, which will be calculated from the date the tax was due (1 July 2013 for HHC) up to the date payment is made.  Where any unpaid HHC/LPT attaches to a property, a person will not be able to sell or transfer it without paying the liability including any interest and penalties that may be due.</p><p>  Finally, Revenue has confirmed to me that there is still time for property owners to pay any outstanding HHC/LPT liabilities in advance of debt collection/enforcement activity starting and I would strongly advise property owners to avail of the opportunity thereby avoiding further unnecessary expense through costly enforcement charges.</p></reply>

If both cohabitants earn in excess of the standard rate band (i.e. &euro;32,800), then they both pay tax at 41% on any income in excess of &euro;32,800.  Married couples or couples in a civil partnership where both individuals work get the same treatment.  The difference between the two groups in relation to income tax is the ability of married couples or civil partners to transfer certain tax credits such as the personal/married credits and part of the tax bands, i.e. the tax band of &euro;65,600 available to married couples or couples in a civil partnership with two incomes in 2013 is transferable between spouses up to a maximum of &euro;41,800.  This is of benefit where one of the individuals earns less than the 20% tax threshold of &euro;32,800 or where one of the individuals has no income.</p><p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p></reply>

My Department's policy is focused on ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school </p><p>network.</p><p>  The policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is currently preparing Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The NCSE has advised my Department that the Policy Advice will be delivered in the spring of 2015 and will draw upon findings gathered from an extensive consultation process which has already commenced.  I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published on 24 January, 2014.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p><p>  The following table sets out the number of pupils required for a school to have 2, 3 and 4 classroom teachers over the period sought by the Deputy. <table><tr><th>School</th><th>Year</th><th>Year</th><th>Year</th><th>Year</th><th>Year</th></tr><tr><td>Size of school</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td></tr><tr><td>2-classroom school </td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>17</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>3-classroom school </td><td>49</td><td>49</td><td>51</td><td>54</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>4-classroom school </td><td>81</td><td>81</td><td>83</td><td>85</td><td>86</td></tr></table></p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less.  The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012.  The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014.  My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. </p><p>  The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2014.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

That mandate includes Irish interests.  Since negotiations began formally in July last year, there have been five formal negotiating rounds, the latest of which took place last week in the US.  </p><p>  This is a comprehensive yet complex negotiating project.  Despite five Rounds of talks having taken place, discussions are still at a comparatively early stage.  While all aspects of trade and investment will be covered, it is very early in the process to say specifically what might finally emerge from the talks and the related implications for Ireland.  What we do know is that the negotiations with the United States are aimed at eliminating tariffs, solving existing regulatory barriers that increase business costs, working to avoid the imposition of unnecessary regulatory barriers in the future, and opening new market opportunities for exporters in both economies.  I expect that any progress on these will be in Ireland's long term interests and Irish companies should have easier, wider and less costly access to the US market.</p><p>  As most of the potential gains from TTIP will arise from regulatory convergence and mutual recognition of the regulatory regimes on both sides of the Atlantic, to the extent that it is possible, Irish business and especially SMEs should benefit from lower regulatory compliance costs.  All of this will provide significant opportunities for Irish businesses to increase their U.S. sales or enter the American market for the first time, as well as reducing the cost of consumer or industrial goods that we import.  I know from my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that in addition to challenges, there is huge potential opportunity in TTIP for the agrifood sector.  Right across the range of issues covered by TTIP, I will ensure we are best positioned to make the most from these and other trade and investment opportunities.</p><p>  We are engaging in detailed analysis of specific opportunities and impacts for Ireland which informs our input to the ongoing negotiations.  I will promote our objective for a comprehensive, balanced and extensive agreement that contributes strongly to economic growth, exports and job creation.  The opportunities flowing from an historic trade and investment agreement with our largest bilateral trading partner are important for the long term development of our country.</p></reply>

There is no specific gender requirement for such an application and someone receiving an IQA can be either a man or a woman.  Generally, persons in respect of whom IQA payments may be claimed are free to claim a social welfare payment in their own right.  For example, where a person of working age is a qualified adult on their spouse's jobseeker's benefit or allowance claim that person may claim jobseeker's benefit or allowance in their own right.  If the claim is successful, the increase for a qualified adult ceases to be payable to the spouse.  In this way equality of access to the schemes is provided.</p><p>  The payment of IQAs is a long standing feature of the welfare system.  Such payments do not have regard to any status of the qualified adult other than the fact that they are a dependent of the claimant.  However, it is true that despite changes in the role of women in society and in the labour market generally, most qualified adults are women.  Issues in relation to qualified adult payment are part of the current considerations of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, in the context of their fourth report on working age payments, which is due to be completed in the coming months.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses.  For example:</p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps.  Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016. #</p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network.  Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps.  Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. </p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure.  It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage.  The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks.</p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg's multiband spectrum auction.  There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. </p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. </p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years.  This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government's determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  Currently I envisage that a total of 28 areas in County Offaly will be included in the proposed fibre build-out.  The list is available on my Department's website .  In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. </p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised.  It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. </p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas.  I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component.  In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st</sup>century.</p></reply>

An exemption from the Local Property Tax applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.  The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012.  The survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency.  Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.  </p><p>The Government has taken a number of significant steps to address the issue of Unfinished Housing Developments, in particular the development of Site Resolution Plans (SRPs), agreed between residents, developers, funders and local authority personnel for the finalisation of works on site to render estates as habitable as possible, have been pivotal in resolving a large number of estates.  In the 2013 National Housing Survey, of the 1,811 estates inspected, there were 607 in some stage of SRPs.  Specifically, 281 were agreed and ready for implementation, 213 had commenced while 113 had been completed.  I believe that a continuation of this collaborative approach serves the best interests of all concerned and is an effective tool in the resolution process.   </p><p>The Public Safety Initiative (PSI), which was launched in March 2011, also provided funding to address immediate public safety issues in unfinished housing developments.  The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling &euro;4.5m to local authorities from the funding made available.  To date, &euro;3.3m has been drawn down. Local Authorities have been advised that the deadline for receipt of any new applications for PSI funding is 30 May 2014.   </p><p>To assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments, Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF).  The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.  It was envisaged that the SRF be particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax exemption, as in a seriously problematic condition. </p><p>In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications was 28 February 2014. All submissions have now been evaluated by my Department in accordance with the criteria circulated to local authorities<i>.</i>On 2 May 2014, I announced SRF allocations to 86 housing developments across the country.  Further information is available at the following weblink:</p><p>.  This public investment will leverage an additional &euro;12m from third parties (developers/lenders/bonds) which will be invested in these estates.  It is hoped that the SRF will enable very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.   </p><p>There are no plans to revise the list of developments included in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013, either by removing or adding developments to it, at this time.</p></reply>

KCS sets out an overall systemic approach to the objective of reducing the number of fires and consequent annual loss, based on a risk management approach to fire safety.  Following an in-depth examination of a number of different service delivery options, it was considered appropriate that fire services remain a local government service, with appropriate local political accountability.  However, while fire authorities remain based on the principal local authorities, KCS provides for a move to a 'shared services' structure, involving a reduction in the number of actual fire services from 30 to 21, with 14 single fire authorities and 7 'shared services'.</p><p>A full list of these can be found in the following table.  Further information, including a map of the future service delivery units, can be found at Chapter 3 of the main KCS policy document which is available on my Department's website at: .<table><tr><th><b>Local Authority</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>14 large population areas</b></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td></tr><tr><td>Louth (incl Dundalk &amp;amp; Drogheda)</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td></tr><tr><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>7 &ldquo;shared service&rdquo; basis</b></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td></tr><tr><td>Longford/Westmeath (includes Athlone Fire Auth.)</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow /Kilkenny</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Sligo/Leitrim</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City &amp;amp; County</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council/South Dublin County Council/ Fingal/Dunlaoghaire-Rathdown</td></tr></table></p><p>The integration of fire services in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford has been successfully advanced and this experience provides a basis for developing the recommended 'shared services' arrangements among fire authorities.  It is envisaged that the revised structure will be in place nationally by end-2015.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that statistics on applications by litigants for Digital Audio Recordings (DAR) are not maintained and also that there is no fee payable by the applicant for a recording of court proceedings.</p><p>  The Courts Service has a five year contract (extendable by two years) up to the end of 2015 for Digital Audio Recording Systems, Managed Storage and Transcription Services with Fujitsu (Ireland) Limited.  The contract was entered into following a procurement process in accordance with EU and government procurement regulations.  Access to DAR recordings for members of the judiciary is via a database accessible from each judge's computer.  This service forms part of the overall contract and statistics on access to this database by judges are not maintained.  I am informed that the total cost of DAR to the Courts Service Vote in 2013 was &euro;2,197,070.</p><p>  Transcription services for the courts are sub-contracted by Fujitsu to a service-provider.  I am informed that the majority of transcripts are created in Ireland by staff working for the service provider.  In the last year the total folios of transcripts transcribed was 495,335 and 92.3% of this was transcribed in Ireland.  International transcribers are only used when the volume of transcripts reaches a peak.  However, in-camera cases are transcribed only within Ireland.  The cost of creating a transcript is based on the length of the transcript and the turnaround time, regardless of where the transcript is created.</p></reply>

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are kept under  review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.  The increased monetary jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts which came into effect in February 2014 should ultimately lead to reduced legal costs for individuals and companies involved in litigation.  Other efficiency measures are currently being examined such as extending e-filing which is currently available for small claims and personal insolvency applications and will become available for debt claims when the necessary supporting legislation is in place.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Legal Aid Board grants legal aid to persons on foot of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 to take and defend court proceedings.  The authorisation is by way of a legal aid certificate and the majority of certificate types require payment of a financial contribution for the certificate to be effective.  An authorisation is only granted if the Board is satisfied that the case meets the 'merits' tests that are set out in the aforementioned legislation.  The minimum contribution is &euro;130 and most cases are assessed at the minimum payment.  There is a facility to apply to reduce or waive the contribution where not to do so would cause hardship.  There are certain case types, notably the defence of applications by the Child and Family Agency regarding children, where no payment is required. Once the certificate is signed and the contribution is discharged, representation is provided.</p><p>In addition, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which has completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and which I expect to commence Report Stage in June, gives legislative expression to the commitment in the Programme for Government to <i>&quot;establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.  </i>The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 117 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.  An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the taxation of disputed legal costs by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new and modernised Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators.</p><p>I would expect that, along with those other cost-cutting measures being introduced by the Government in relation to legal services, the new legal costs regime set out in the Bill will help reduce such costs and their impact on clients and will increase access to justice for citizens.</p></reply>

Progress has been made on the Healthy Eating guidelines, Calories on Menus initiative and the Report on Recommendations to reduce consumption of high fat, salt and sugar foods and drinks from the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid.  Treatment algorithms are available for those in Primary Care health services.  Arising out of the Irish Presidency of the EU and the Informal Meeting of Health Ministers, the EU Commissioner supported the call for an EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity to be developed by the EU High Level Group On Nutrition and Physical Activity. This Plan has been drafted and will be finalised in 2014.</p><p>As one of the measures specifically designed to combat Childhood Obesity, I launched the safefood/HI/HSE three year Childhood Obesity Campaign &ndash; Childhood Obesity: Let's take it on &ndash; one small step at a time - which is designed to create greater awareness among parents about the threat of childhood overweight and obesity and provide practical tips to help address the problem with the ultimate aim and effecting behaviour change.  <i>Healthy Ireland</i>supports a whole-of-government approach to address the determinants and predictors of health and well-being, many of which fall outside the health sector, e.g. housing, transportation, education, workplaces and environment along with an individual's socioeconomic status.  It sets out four central Goals and outlines actions under six Thematic Areas, in which all people and all parts of society can participate to achieve these goals through 64 Actions.  Progress in the first year is being focused on a small number of key actions with the greatest potential to make a difference and, in particular, to establish the foundations on which future progress will depend. </p><p>Comprehensive, multi-level approaches are required to address the obesity epidemic and the work of SAGO and Healthy Ireland is ongoing.</p></reply>

Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.   </p><p>Services provided include assessment, diagnosis and ongoing treatment and intervention supports.  These may include home support services, respite services and multi-disciplinary team supports to assess the individual needs of each person with ASD and provide for the appropriate interventions.  Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005, also provides for an Assessment of Need process, which at present encompasses younger children.  This process provides for the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be assessed within specific timeframes.</p><p>The Health Service Executive's <i>National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report</i>(2012) and its <i>National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)</i>set out the overall policy context for the provision of autism services to children and young people.  The objective of the Progressing Children's Disability Services Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services.  This Programme aims to ensure greater equity in accessing services, based on need, clearer referral pathways to these services and improved collaboration between the relevant sectors.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  In addition, the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments, in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, will be of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD in order to ensure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions. </p><p>With regard to access to redress in general terms, the Health Act 2004, provides that all service users of the HSE have the right to make a complaint where they believe that the standards of care, treatment or practice fall short of what is acceptable.  More information in relation to this complaints process is available on the HSE's website, .  In terms of seeking redress in relation to unmet statutory obligations, under the Disability Act, 2005, applicants for the Assessment of Need process have access to a dedicated redress system consisting of a complaints process to a designated Complaints Officers and an onward appeal to an independent Disability Appeals Officer.</p></reply>

The Bill, as introduced, makes provision for the preparation of an autism strategy and a national framework for addressing the specific needs of adults with autism.  The broad thrust of the Bill was accepted by Government and it was not opposed at Second Stage.  Although the needs of people with autism have received some recognition in recent years, the Bill is seen as contributing to a more enlightened and educated public debate.</p><p>  In the context of the Autism Bill, it is important to note that the Government is already committed under the National Disability Strategy (NDS) to ensuring that people with autism are empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society.  The NDS is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and is the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.</p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, will be of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD, so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions.  The ongoing work of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy will inform this process. </p></reply>

Under the legislation, determination of an individual's eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  The 1970 Health Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their family, having regard to their overall financial situation and reasonable expenditure.  The legislation is clear that qualification for a medical card is means-tested.  Medical cards are not awarded - nor have they ever been - on the basis of a particular illness or disease.  Medical cards are not issued 'automatically' - or irrespective of means - even if an applicant is suffering from a serious medical condition or a life long condition. </p><p>  While there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illnesses, or with a disability, the HSE has discretion to award a medical card to avoid undue hardship, having regard to person's or the family's overall financial situation, even where the person's income exceeds the income guidelines.  The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  As I have outlined, the 1970 Act established a financial means assessment and medical card eligibility is granted on the basis of the financial situation of the applicant.  The nature of a disease or illness an applicant may have is not the basis for granting eligibility and I can assure the Deputy that all applicants are treated in a standard, uniform manner.</p><p>  The HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs.  This issue is being addressed in a manner that includes all of the services and supports provided by the HSE with as much flexibility as is available and at a local level.</p></reply>

The HPSC has begun the process of establishing a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  This will involve, inter alia, raising awareness among clinicians and the general public.</p><p>  As part of the recent HPSC &quot;Lyme Awareness Week&quot;, a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a &quot;Tickborn Disease Toolkit&quot; developed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) which is available on the ECDC website.  In addition, this toolkit has been modified for local use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website.  The Deputy will be interested to hear that the ECDC has informed the HPSC that Ireland is the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material.</p><p>  One important strand of the work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee will be to explore methods to highlight such preventive material with the media and the general public.  What is clear from the available evidence is that public health advices such as measures to minimise tick bites are quickly forgotten.  It is crucial, therefore, that such messages are repeated frequently and in such media that the general public will take full notice of the messages and act upon them. Obviously, these messages should be prominent in areas where there is a heightened risk of being bitten by an infected tick and the Sub-Committee will be exploring ways to ensure that these messages are brought to the public's attention with frequency and in forms in which they can be most effective.</p></reply>

Departments are required to implement measures to secure greater take-up of online services which can also deliver much needed cost savings to the Exchequer.  For this reason  emphasis has been placed on administrative aspects of the motor tax renewal process where savings can be achieved through more imaginative use of the online motor tax service including the introduction of electronic (email) reminders, which reduce both volumes and cost of  paper  motor tax renewal reminder notices.</p><p>My Department now issues approx 50% (200,000) of such notices each month by email.  Only customers who signed up for the electronic service receive their notice via this channel.  Motorists who have declined this option, or who last taxed the vehicle at the local Motor Tax Office, continue to receive a motor tax renewal notice in the post.  In situations where vehicle owners lose or mislay the PIN which facilitates online taxing, there is an online PIN retrieval facility at .  The online motor tax service continues to be one of the most successful eGovernment services and the returns for 2014 to date, indicate that 67% of vehicle owners now renew their motor tax online.  This represents a very significant increase of 7% for the same period in 2013.</p></reply>

A small number are provided in workplace locations.  All of these services are developed in response to local or employment needs and the ongoing viability of such enterprises is a matter for the service providers.  My Department has no responsibility in relation to the sustainability of the creche at Tallaght hospital or any other individual childcare service. </p><p>  The recent enactment through the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 of amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 underpins a number of key reforms being introduced as part of the Pre-School Quality Agenda.  The amended legislation strengthens the current inspection regime, provides a statutory basis for the registration of early years services, and also provides for the setting of minimum qualification standards for staff working with children in early years services.  </p><p>  To provide for the implementation of the changes to the Act it will be necessary to amend or make additions to the current Regulations in a number of areas, and these are currently being finalised.  New National Quality Standards will also be published.  It is not intended to impose any additional costs on services as a result of the new regulations, other than an increase in the annual fee payable by services to the Early Years Inspectorate.  In the case of the service in question, the increase in the fee payable is expected to be in the region of &euro;80 per annum.</p><p>  My Department has introduced measures to support training for childcare staff to enable them to upskill to meet the increased qualification requirements and &euro;3 million is being made available over the next two years for this initiative.  A key element of the Pre-School Quality Agenda is to strengthen the pre-school inspection system nationally.  My Department is working with the Early Years Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach.  I am confident that these reforms will provide for a more consistent and robust pre-school inspection regime.</p></reply>

In 2013 the HSE spent over &euro;17 million on the provision of domestic and sexual violence services.  This included the funding of 60 services throughout the country comprising:</p><p>  - &euro;10m for 20 Crisis Refuges</p><p>  - Over &euro;4 million for 16 Rape Crisis Centres </p><p>  - Almost &euro;3.5 million for 24 Support Services. </p><p>Funding in 2014 for Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence Services has been retained at 2013 levels and is managed within the office of the Chief Executive of the Child and Family Agency. </p><p>  In line with Government policy, all service level agreements and contracts with the voluntary and community sector, including those providing services in response to domestic, sexual and gender based violence are required to protect frontline services, improve productivity and keep overhead costs to a minimum.  In the context of the ongoing budgetary constraints that affect all publicly funded organisations, it is for each funded organisation to decide on how best to manage budgets in order to operate within available resources.  In cases where reductions in levels of service are implemented by funded organisations, the Child and Family Agency expects that service users are provided with information about other available supports, including alternative sexual violence support services in the region and the 24 hour helpline provided by Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  Where specific financial difficulties arise for individual services, the Child and Family Agency will engage at local level to address emerging issues.</p><p>  A review is being undertaken of national provision of sexual violence and domestic violence support services with a view to establishing a more consistent approach to the delivery of these services nationally and enhancing the availability of high quality, effective services.  A strategic plan for these services will be completed in 2014.  The Child and Family Agency will work closely with all stakeholders to ensure the provision of responsive and integrated sexual violence and domestic violence supports services to adults, children and families.</p></reply>
