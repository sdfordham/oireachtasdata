The Report followed from the establishment in May 2011 of the Copyright Review Committee to examine current Irish copyright legislation to identify any areas that might be perceived as creating barriers to innovation and to make recommendations as to how these barriers might be overcome through changes to legislation. </p><p>  In Ireland, as in many countries throughout the world, there has been a growing recognition of the need to ensure that copyright legislation remains fit for purpose in the digital age and the specific challenges that it presents.  This is also an issue on which the EU is currently deliberating and I understand that the European Commission has announced its intentions to undertake a consultation on copyright later this month in the context also of its review of the copyright acquis.</p><p>  The Report, published by the Copyright Review Committee, involved an extensive consultation process by the Committee, and contains in excess of 60 recommendations covering a diverse range of copyright issues.  My Department is currently engaged in conducting a detailed analysis of the recommendations in the Report which I expect will take until early 2014 to complete. I would hope thereafter, to be in a position at that point to bring the results of our examination to Government with recommendations including in relation to proposed legislative amendments.  As part of our initial examination of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, I am very interested in hearing the views of all interested parties so that, as a first step, my Department has arranged for the convening of a public Forum at which the members of the Copyright Review Committee will be present to present on the Report and to respond to issues arising.  This Forum is being held in the Royal Irish Academy on 9 December next and registration for the Forum can be completed on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p></reply>

In Pratt and Whitney&rsquo;s case, a decision was taken by the parent company to transfer dwindling customer requirements to a site in the US. This has resulted in the phasing out of older technologies and products. However, the company still has excess capacity across its engineering/maintenance/repair operations.  Indeed 4 other such sites had already been closed by the company.  This is the key determinant in their decision to initiate a process which is likely to cease production at the Rathcoole plant and to introduce a redundancy programme there, on a phased basis, over the next eighteen months. 107 jobs will be impacted by the programme.</p><p>  IDA have engaged regularly with the company over recent years in order to assist them address the challenges they faced in a very fast-changing and competitive marketplace. This involved advice and support towards addressing issues that arose for the company from time to time.  IDA arranged that the company became involved in a wider grouping of International Engineering companies, based in Ireland, which IDA established, in order to benefit from shared experiences and facilitate capacity building.  In addition IDA met with senior management for Pratt and Whitney in the USA in October 2013 and, also, they have held ongoing engagement with the wider parent group, United Technologies, in the USA .</p><p>  In the case of Lufthansa, the decision to enter into a consultation process with the workers was taken following an extensive review of operations, in the context of declining revenues and shrinking international market opportunities.  The company has pointed out that enhanced quality and efficiencies of the new generations of aircraft engines &ndash; with reduced need for overhaul &ndash; has impacted on their business with fewer engines becoming available for service.  There are also complex changes in the dynamics of aircraft maintenance, including engine refurbishment, worldwide, which have knock-on impacts in facilities such as those in Ireland.  As you will appreciate, the ultimate decision in these cases is made by the parent company, on strictly commercial grounds, and on what is seen by the company as being in the best interests of the group as a whole. </p><p>  I have met senior executives of the company on three occasions since taking office and IDA have been engaged with them very frequently over recent years in an effort to find solutions to the difficult business environment they face. The IDA arranged the intervention of the State&rsquo;s Industrial Relations service at a time of Industrial Relations difficulties and considerable progress was achieved on that issue at the time.  IDA also approved a training grant to train the production workers on a new engine type which enabled the company to take on new business. As various other issues arose there was regular contact between the IDA and company management to provide advice and information. However the current challenges are very significant.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has met with company management in both cases with a view to creating a profile of the Rathcoole plants, and of the workforces and their skills, for marketing purposes by IDA&rsquo;s global team.  IDA will remain in on-going contact with the companies during the next 12-18 months.  In addition, I have arranged that Enterprise Ireland will engage with the company to explore whatever other options might be possible, taking into account that Agency&rsquo;s remit and experience in supporting the Irish-owned engineering sector.   </p><p>  I am conscious of the highly-skilled workforces at both companies and have asked IDA to explore the possibility of securing a takeover or buy-out for either company.  I want to assure the House that all that can be done by the State&rsquo;s agencies in an effort to secure a positive result for the employees at both companies is being done and will continue to be done, including any appropriate upskilling of the employees affected.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-27a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112700058#WRA01200"><p>One of the key means to expanding market access in the US will be the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  The decision by the EU Trade Council last June to formally launch negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the US was the outcome of a key Government objective for Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency.  Now that the negotiations are underway, we will fully play our part in supporting the EU Commission in getting the best deal possible for Ireland and the EU.  </p><p>  The mandate on the EU side is a broad ranging one, covering virtually all sectors of economic interest.  It builds on the outcome of the work of the EU-US High Level Group that recommended that negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement between the EU and the US should aim to achieve ambitious outcomes in three broad areas, namely market access, regulatory barriers and non-tariff barriers, and rules addressing shared global trade challenges and opportunities.  With this wide scope for negotiation, market access opportunities should follow.</p><p>  I fully intend to ensure that these opportunities can be exploited through the activities of the agencies under my remit.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s remit is to maintain and grow jobs in Irish companies by driving the growth of Irish-owned companies in overseas markets.  In that context, Enterprise Ireland is working with Irish companies to assist them entering and expanding into the US market. Since taking office, I have undertaken 9 trade and investment missions to the United States. I have also initiated a joint working group between IDA and EI to develop the possibility for global sourcing by Irish companies.</p><p>  The USA is a key overseas market for Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies; in 2012 Enterprise Ireland clients&rsquo; exports to the USA amounted to &euro;1.56 billion (approximately 10% of total client exports), representing a 20% increase over 2011 figures, making the USA a priority market for our clients.  Enterprise Ireland has 4 offices in the USA, in New York, Boston, Silicon Valley and Texas.  The Texas office was newly opened this year.  All 4 offices are on the ground, working in partnership with Irish enterprises, providing a cohesive set of supports to help them exploit the opportunities of the US market.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-27a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112700058#WRA01400"><p>The Life Sciences sector is central to the Action Plan for Jobs and in particular for Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) strategy to support their indigenous Irish clients to create jobs.  As far as EI clients are concerned, the approval of a number of new drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2013 is expected to provide limited opportunity for the indigenous pharmaceutical companies in the short term.  The indigenous pharmaceutical manufacturing companies are mainly focussed on over the counter and generic pharmaceutical products and sold mainly in the UK and Europe.  Those companies have access to all the full suite of state supports available to indigenous industry.  If any opportunities arise for indigenous pharmaceutical companies, Enterprise Ireland will bring all its supports to bear in support of such opportunities. Enterprise Ireland continues to work closely with IDA Ireland to link indigenous companies with their FDI counterparts and this may generate some opportunities in support, services and sub contract manufacturing.  </p><p>  IDA are seeing some positive investment trends from existing and new clients concerning the manufacture of newly approved drugs in Ireland. Many of these new drugs are low volume and can be accommodated in existing Irish sites.  However many of the newly approved drugs are biotech drugs and may well require greenfield, expansion investments and new job creation in bio-manufacturing.</p><p>  Central to the continued success of Irish companies internationally has been their R&amp;amp;D capabilities, leadership and management strengths and collaborative partnerships with some of the world&rsquo;s leading companies in the sector. The indigenous company base has extensive capabilities across the pharmaceutical and biotechnology supply chain including drug discovery, development and drug delivery; the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the manufacture of human and veterinary finished products; the provision of pharma services, including clinical trials management, regulation, engineering and construction.   </p><p>  The indigenous bio-pharmachemical sector plays a key role in this ecosystem and consists of approximately 100 Enterprise Ireland client companies. This sector has been growing at an average of 14% per annum over the last four years. In 2012, the sector had exports of over &euro;450M, and employment of over 2,500 people. The indigenous sector is highly innovative and dynamic with companies competing successfully in international markets throughout the world e.g. Sigmoid, Opsona, Alimentary Health, ICON, Chanelle, TopChem, Barclays, Eirgen, Arran Chemicals etc. </p><p>  The State has invested heavily through Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in the development of a World-class Research Infrastructure by funding industry-academic research collaborations, Industry-led research programmes, Technology Centres and the Technology Gateways Programmes through the likes of the National Institute for Bioprocess Research and Training (NIBRT), the Solid State Pharmaceutics cluster and the Pharma Technology Centre. These centres aim to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the Irish biopharma industry by investing in research on next generation manufacturing processes and training &amp;amp; education of people to work in this industry.</p><p>  A key focus for Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and other relevant stakeholder bodies is to promote and build expertise in &lsquo;biological&rsquo; research, development and manufacture such that Ireland continues to develop as a globally recognised &lsquo;biopharmaceutical hub&rsquo;. The NIBRT facility has been effective in bringing training on large molecule manufacturing processes to the sector in Ireland that has successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck, Biomarin and Pfizer, as examples.  Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of pharmaceutical products.</p><p>  IDA Ireland, through its overseas network, remains committed to maintaining and growing relationships with key decision makers in the pharmaceutical industry and can offer a wide variety of assistance to companies to support new investment and uplift in technical capability of existing clients.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-27a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112700058#WRA01600"><p>The EU-Mercosur trade negotiations take place in the context of the EU&rsquo;s common commercial policy. The EU Commission leads the talks for the EU. Negotiations on an EU-Mercosur Association Agreement were launched in 2000<i>, </i>suspended in 2004 due to substantial differences on the trade part of the agreement, and resumed again in May 2010. Since then, nine negotiating rounds were held, the last one in October 2012. These rounds focused on trade rules. At the EU-Mercosur trade ministerial meeting held in Santiago on 26 January 2013, the EU and Mercosur agreed to exchange offers on market access concessions for goods, services and government procurement not later than in the last quarter of 2013.  I understand that while the EU Commission is currently preparing the draft EU offer, it is not clear if the EU and Mercosur offers will actually be exchanged before the end of this year. </p><p>  Brazil, the largest economy by far in Mercosur, is important for Ireland&rsquo;s future export growth. It is identified in the Strategy for Trade, Tourism and Investment as a key priority market for trade and investment. Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have offices in Brazil to attract inward investment and help create new exporting business for Irish firms. Improving export performance in faster growing emerging economic blocs such as Mercosur is important for our economic recovery and for creating new jobs.  Access to the EU beef market is a sensitive issue for Ireland in these negotiations. The EU Commission is very well aware of this and I expect this to be reflected in the preparation of the EU&rsquo;s offer. As the Mercosur negotiations develop I will ensure our economic interests in this agreement are both promoted and defended to the fullest extent possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-27a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112700058#WRA01800"><p>The Government is committed to reform of the State&rsquo;s existing Workplace Relations Services.  Shortly after entering office, I committed to a fundamental reform of the workplace relations system. The overall objectives are to promote harmonious and productive employment relationships and to encourage early resolution of disputes, the vindication of employees&rsquo; rights and minimisation of the costs involved for all parties - employers, employees and Government - in terms of money, time and workplace productivity. </p><p>  I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure which will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill. Enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary acts, 12 specified parts or sections of acts and 71 statutory instruments.  My Department has been engaging with the AG's Office on an on-going basis to progress the drafting of the Bill and I am committed to the publication and enactment of the legislation at an early stage with a view to having the proposed new Workplace Relations structures in place during 2014.</p><p>  In addition to the progression of the enabling legislation, much work has already been completed or is underway in relation to the enhancement of efficiency, effectiveness, business processes and technology, within the bodies concerned.  This Government has also introduced a wide range of measures to establish and protect the employment rights of workers and to provide the policy, legislative and institutional framework within which good industrial relations prosper. </p><p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, which commenced on 1 August 2012, provides for a radical overhaul of the statutory wage setting mechanisms and reinstates a robust system of protection for low paid and vulnerable workers in the aftermath of the 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.  The 2012 Act provided for reviews of each Joint Labour Committee (JLC) to be carried out by the Labour Court. On 1 October, 2013, I published the Labour Court Report.  I have accepted the recommendations contained in the Report and the Ministerial Orders to effect the recommendations are currently being drafted and I hope to be in a position to sign them shortly. </p><p>  In May 2013, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the framework for Registered Employment Agreements. This is clearly an important issue for many employers and their employees, particularly in relation to rates of pay and tendering for contracts and I intend to bring forward legislation to address the ruling as soon as possible.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the current law on employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining, so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. Discussions with stakeholders on the issue are on-going and I hope to be in a position to put proposals to Cabinet shortly. </p><p>  This Government decision in 2011 to reverse the &euro;1 per hour reduction in the National Minimum Wage introduced by the previous Government represents a significant commitment to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers.  The Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012, provides that equal treatment in terms of basic working and employment conditions must be applied to temporary agency workers in the same way as if they were directly recruited by the hirer to the same or similar job.   </p><p>  Migrant workers are a vulnerable class of people and careful consideration is given to the potential for abuse and many of the criteria in evaluating employment permits applications focus on the bona-fides of the employer and the protection of the employee.  This feature of the employment permits regime will be preserved in the draft Employment Permits Bill which I envisage submitting to Government for approval at the earliest opportunity.  The Bill as drafted will also provide, subject to Government approval, for amending legislation in order to provide a defence for the employee, following the result of the High Court Judgement of 31st August 2012 concerning Mr. Younis.</p><p>  The introduction of these measures demonstrates this Government's commitment to deliver modern, user friendly and world class workplace relations services and to ensure optimum protection for the employment rights of workers.</p></reply>

This agreement with the U.S. is very significant not only for the EU but also for Ireland given the scale of U.S. investment here and the deep historic ties we have with America. In 2012, U.S. firms had investments worth over $200 billion in our country and last year we exported over &euro;26 billion in goods and services to U.S. buyers. These facts underline the importance of this Partnership to Ireland, and the tens of thousands that are employed around the country by U.S. firms and indigenous ones that sell into the U.S. market. </p><p>  With a focus on an export led recovery to stimulate growth and new jobs, this and similar agreements are really important to Ireland because they give our exporters greater access to new markets. With the weight of the EU behind these and other trade agreements we can achieve far greater benefits for our exporters than would be possible otherwise.  This is the largest and most comprehensive economic agreement ever contemplated by the EU with another country. I am pleased that the mandate for the first Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership was adopted by the EU Council during the Irish Presidency. </p><p>  Competence for undertaking trade and investment negotiations flows from the many referenda, including most recently that on the Lisbon Treaty. Accordingly, competence for negotiating the TTIP rests with the EU Commission under the EU's common commercial policy. These negotiations take place on the basis of specific mandates from the EU Council of Ministers to the EU Commission.</p></reply>

However, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs has set the objective of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy over the period 2012 to 2016 with an overall target of 2 million people in sustainable employment by 2020, through a series of annual measures aimed at improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and making it easier for enterprises to do business.  Data from the Central Statistics Office shows that employment increased by 58,000 in the year to Quarter 3 2013. Employment in the private sector increased by 61,900 when account is taken of a reduction of 3,900 in public sector numbers.  This was the fourth consecutive Quarter where an increase in employment was recorded.</p><p>  We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came to office, to the present situation where it is creating close to 1,200 jobs per month.

Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include:</p><p>  - In Company Law, savings of &euro;82 million per annum have already been realised, more than &euro;33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts. </p><p>  - In Health &amp;amp; Safety Law, a total of &euro;124 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (&euro;60m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (&euro;64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.</p><p>  - In Employment Law, savings of &euro;1.2 million were realised by simplifying online procedures and forms. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that reducing the administration burden on taxpayers and making it as easy as possible for them to be compliant is one of their key corporate objectives.  In recent years the Revenue Commissioners have also reduced the administrative burden on business by 25% through a number of initiatives, saving the business community over &euro;85 million per year.  I am also advised that in the Revenue Statement of Strategy 2011-2014, one of its core strategic priorities is to make it easier and less costly for taxpayers to comply and Revenue is constantly looking for opportunities to drive down compliance costs for business.</p><p>  The success of strategies is borne out to some extent when comparing this country against other jurisdictions.  One such benchmark study is the World Bank/PWC Report &ldquo;Ease of Paying Taxes 2014&rdquo;.  In this study, out of 189 countries, Ireland ranks in 6th place and 1st in the EU.  The level of voluntary compliance is also a valid indicator of the effectiveness of a tax administration.  Revenue&rsquo;s strategies include consulting with stakeholders, reducing complexity and providing good quality services to make it as easy as possible to comply.  This approach, as evidenced by the table below, has resulted in very high levels of compliance.<table><tr><th>Tax</th><th>2012  </th><th>2011</th></tr><tr><td>PAYE/PRSI</td><td>95%</td><td>95%</td></tr><tr><td>VAT</td><td>91%</td><td>91%</td></tr><tr><td>Preliminary Income Tax (Non PAYE)</td><td>98%</td><td>97%</td></tr><tr><td>Capital Gains Tax</td><td>94%</td><td>91%</td></tr><tr><td>Corporation Tax</td><td>98%</td><td>91%</td></tr><tr><td>Relevant Contracts Tax</td><td>86%</td><td>85%</td></tr></table></p><p>  We also need to continue to listen to business, especially SMEs and micro-enterprises, and find out where regulation is most burdensome.  The High Level Group on Business Regulation, chaired by Deputy Perry, the Minister for Small Business, acts as a standing dialogue between business and Government, and looks for solutions to specific administrative burden issues brought to its attention by the business members. </p><p>  A key part of reducing regulatory burdens is better communication; my Department seeks to improve how information on regulation is communicated, for example through its businessregulation.ie portal which I launched in 2012.  This website brings together in one place many strands of regulatory and compliance information.  A further successful recent initiative was the &lsquo;Taking Care of Business&rsquo; event in Dublin Castle, which brought 500 attendees into direct contact with over 20 Agencies and Departments.</p></reply>

This Fund was the first announcement under the Development Capital Scheme.  The establishment of the Development Capital Scheme is a critical action under the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs and has the objective of increasing the availability of risk capital and closing the &lsquo;equity gap&rsquo; experienced by SMEs seeking risk capital in the region of &euro;2 million - &euro;12 million.</p><p>  The Development Capital Scheme forms part of the suite of new finance measures put in place through the Action Plan for Jobs to increase the availability of funding for SMEs.  A total of &euro;75 million in funding has been made available through my Department for the Development Capital Scheme with the aim of leveraging a minimum total of &euro;150 million in additional funding from the private sector.  Under the Scheme, commitments were made to 3 funds that will provide equity, quasi-equity or debt of between &euro;2 million and &euro;12 million to established investee companies.  A further two funds will be announced in the near term.</p><p>  Each of the funds established under the Development Capital Scheme is aimed at providing funding for the mid-sized, mostly export-oriented businesses with clear growth and development prospects.  The MML fund is a general fund which has no particular sectoral focus.  It will target investments opportunities in a wide variety of growth orientated sectors including manufacturing, technology, engineering, food, life sciences, services and electronics.  Enterprise Ireland invests in these funds on the same terms as the private sector.  The investment managers are responsible for making investment decisions within a clearly defined investment strategy over the life time of the fund.  I look forward to seeing investments in Irish companies in the near term.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I requested Forf&aacute;s to undertake a study of the sector.  The resultant Strategy - <i>Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020</i> sets out the actions needed to address various issues, building on the steps already taken by this Government to improve our international competitiveness.  Key actions are proposed across a range of areas, including access to new funding, management training and support, costs reduction, technology adoption and the implementation of a <i>National Step Change</i> initiative. </p><p>  Despite the losses in earlier years, there are now 205,700 people directly employed in manufacturing, and a similar number of people employed indirectly: the total supported within the sector is therefore just over 400,000.  In the years 2011 and 2012 there was a net increase of 3,700 jobs in the Manufacturing sector.  The Forf&aacute;s Strategy sets a target to create an additional 20,000 jobs in the sector by 2016.</p><p>  With regard to the International Financial Services Sector, the <i>Strategy for the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland</i>, published by the Department of the Taoiseach in 2011, calculated that there were 33,000 people employed directly in Ireland in international financial services (i.e. excluding banking and related financial services activity in the domestic sector) at that time.  The Strategy sets an objective to increase employment in this sector by 10,000 by 2016 and a range of measures are proposed.  Implementation of that Strategy is being driven by the IFSC Clearing House Group, which operates under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. </p><p>  The IDA continues to pursue the attraction of foreign companies in this sector and the recent announcement by<i> Deutsche Bank</i> that they will establish 700 new jobs in Dublin is evidence of the success of these efforts.  Agency supported firms in this sector increased their employment by 1,803 in the two years up to the end of 2012.  The<i> Action Plan for Jobs 2012</i> included a series of actions to address both the Manufacturing and International Financial Services Sectors.  By implementing the 2012 and 2013 Action<i> Plans for Jobs</i> and the new 2014 <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>, to be developed in the New Year, the Government is confident that further growth in employment in both sectors will be achieved.</p></reply>

While 100 redundancies, to be implemented over a two year period, were announced at their facility in September 2011, Covidien Athlone remains an important part of the Covidien Group in Ireland, with over 600 employees, including a Research and Development group that is solely responsible for the design, development and the resulting new product introduction of a range of products.  It has been responsible for a number of key product launches in its area.</p><p>  In relation to Alkermes Athlone, reductions of approximately 100 to 130 staff, from a workforce of 420, were announced earlier this year, to take place over a two-year period as older product lines are phased out.  This process is on-going through a combination of natural attrition, voluntary redundancy and compulsory redundancy.  The Athlone facility will continue to play a strategic part in Alkermes&rsquo; future business, and significant investment is planned to be made at the site over the next number of years which will allow Alkermes to focus primarily on the manufacture of newer, advanced pharmaceutical product lines.  World-class development and manufacturing activities at the plant will remain robust and it will continue producing global pharmaceutical products.      </p><p>  It is very unfortunate that these redundancies had to be initiated but you will appreciate that the Pharma sector is going through significant challenges worldwide and parent companies need to make strategic decisions for their future, which can involve reducing job numbers.  However, both companies retain very significant operations in Ireland. </p><p>  New product innovation drives the future of the Life Sciences business, and Ireland continues to provide a very attractive offering to these companies particularly in terms of access to highly-trained medical technology research and development experts and world class third level institutions.  Access to highly skilled personnel, with expertise and experience in quality-driven, advanced manufacturing techniques is hugely attractive to companies investing here. In this regard, there have been some significant investment announcements in Ireland by companies in the Life Sciences area, particularly in the Pharma/Biopharma sector.  Examples of these announcements include:</p><p><b>- Sanofi</b> (Waterford, Feb. 2013) to invest &euro;44 m in Genzyme&rsquo;s biotechnology campus in Waterford.</p><p><b>- Novartis</b> (Dublin, Apr.2013), the world&rsquo;s second largest pharmaceutical company, is to establish a Business Services Centre in Dublin.  The company now has four sites in Ireland.</p><p><b>- Vistakon Ireland</b> (Limerick, Jan. 2013), a company which designs, manufactures &amp;amp; makes soft disposable contact lenses, announce plans to invest over &euro;100m in expansion of its manufacturing operations in Limerick, up to 100 new jobs.</p><p>  In 2012 foreign-owned companies based in Ireland employed 21,641 people in the chemicals sector compared to 21,499 in 2011 (+ 0.7%) and 24,625 people in the medical devices area compared to 23,627 (+ 4.2%).  Following a decline in growth by foreign-owned companies from 2008 to 2011, there are now positive signs of growth in these areas.  Based on this positive trend it is expected that there will continue to be future gains for Ireland in the Life Sciences sector.</p></reply>

My Department has been consulting with the Irish Banking Federation to ascertain the likely level of take-up of any revised scheme.  I am awaiting a final assessment from the Review Steering Group, chaired by my Department, and plan to bring my findings and conclusions to Government and the Oireachtas, as soon as possible thereafter.

Key actions are proposed across a wide range of areas. The Forfas Strategy sets a target to create an additional 20,000 jobs in the sector by 2016.  The most up to date figures available for job creation in the manufacturing and services sector are included in the Forfas Employment Survey 2012.  There is no data available on a month to month basis for each of these sectors.</p><p>  Despite the losses in earlier years in manufacturing, there are now 205,700 people directly employed in the sector in Ireland, and a similar number of people employed indirectly: the total supported within the sector is therefore just over 400,000.  In the years 2011 and 2012 there was a net increase of 3,700 jobs in the Manufacturing sector.  The Services sector accounts for two thirds of total employment within Ireland. While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency supported companies, the total number of jobs lost in 2012 was 6,950; the number of jobs gained in 2012 was 13,229.  Therefore the total <i>net new full-time jobs</i> created in the agency supported service industry for 2012 is 6,279. This is positive growth in both sectors.  In addition, the indicators are now looking equally positive in the Private Sector where 3,000 jobs are being created every month as our competitiveness improves and consumer confidence slowly returns.  </p><p>  The<i> Action Plan for Jobs 2012</i> included a series of actions across a wide number of sectors including manufacturing and services. By implementing the 2012 and 2013 Action<i> Plans for Jobs</i> and the new 2014 <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>  , to be developed in the New Year, the Government is confident that further growth in employment in both sectors will be achieved.</p></reply>

It is intended to expand the current research exemption under the Patents Act 1992 to include a wider range of activities in the nature of studies, tests and trials etc. and the consequential practical requirements necessary for the purpose of obtaining marketing authorisation for medicinal or veterinary products.  This expanded exemption will cover acts done in this country relating to the acquisition of a marketing authorisation in a non-EEA country.  These amendments will bring Ireland&rsquo;s research exemption into line with other competitor countries for investment by pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>  The proposed amendment to the Trade Marks Act is designed to resolve a technical conflict between the Trade Marks Act and the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trade Marks which needs to be reconciled before Ireland can accede to the Singapore Treaty.  Accession to the Treaty would reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Trade Mark Law Treaty of 1994 and enable Ireland to participate in the future direction of the administration of trade mark law at international level.  Moreover, following the publication last month of the report of the independent Copyright Review Committee, <i>Modernising Copyright</i>, my Department is currently considering and evaluating the recommendations contained in the Report.  I expect, upon completion of this evaluation, to be in a position to bring the results of our examination to Government with recommendations, including in relation to proposed legislative amendments, with a view to stimulating innovation and to ensure that Ireland is well positioned to meet the needs of the digital age.  </p><p>  In order to deliver on a commitment in the Programme for Government which was further articulated in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, my Department commissioned a Feasibility Study to examine what structures and policies could be developed to make Ireland a world centre for managing and trading in intellectual property. The objectives of the study were to identify and describe the emerging trends in IP Portfolio Management in corporations globally; and taking account of such global emerging trends, to identify options and models for Ireland to leverage its existing strengths to become an internationally attractive centre for managing and trading in IP, such that this could realise an economic and jobs potential. </p><p>  The Study, which was undertaken by Deloitte, is now being considered by officials in my Department in the context of wider policy developments and economic conditions domestically and globally.</p></reply>

The former MBNA Credit Card Processing facility in Carrick-on-Shannon now comprises two operations. Firstly, a new operation called AvantCard was established following the purchase of part of BOA&rsquo;s Credit Card portfolio by Apollo. This operation employs approximately 250 staff who transferred from BOA to AvantCard (Apollo) under TUPE regulations on 13 March 2013.  I welcome this positive development. The second operation remains in the ownership of BOA and employs approximately 200 people who take care of the UK credit card business.  Apollo has acquired the entire building in Carrick and has leased back office space to BOA.  We welcome this investment in Carrick-on-Shannon by Apollo.</p><p>  BOA continues to look for a buyer for the remainder of the UK credit card book. IDA Ireland is in regular contact with Bank of America management in Dublin and with the parent company in the US to monitor developments.  IDA met with senior executives of Apollo in London in September 2013 where the transfer of the Carrick facility and staff to Apollo, and further investment opportunities for the group in Ireland, were discussed. IDA will remain in contact with the company and will continue to highlight the strengths of the Carrick site to a broad range of potential investors.</p></reply>

Broadly speaking, the Action Plan for Jobs envisages that an extra 20,000 jobs can be created in manufacturing activities, while 30,000 jobs can be created in internationally traded services.  These will support a further 50,000 new indirect jobs in the economy.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs, we have, with the help of Forf&aacute;s, assessed the job potential of several sectors. These include manufacturing, agri-food, ICT, tourism, Business Process Outsourcing, international financial services, retail, construction and the Green Economy.  There is a strong mix of both multinational companies and indigenous SMEs involved in these sectors.  Enterprise Ireland has set a target of supporting 10,500 new jobs on a gross basis in 2013, while IDA Ireland aims to generate 13,000 gross new jobs this year.</p><p>  Both the Department of Finance and the ESRI have recently produced improved employment forecasts for 2013 and 2014.  These improved forecasts are supported by the latest employment statistics published by the Central Statistics Office yesterday (26 November) which show that employment increased by 58,000 in the year to Quarter 3 2013, net of a reduction of 3,900 in public sector numbers.  This is the fourth Quarter in succession where employment has grown on an annual basis.  Increases in employment have been recorded in eight of the fourteen economic sectors categorised by the CSO, including Agriculture, Forestry &amp;amp; Fishing, Construction, ICT, and Accommodation and Food services which are targeted for attention under the Action Plan for Jobs.   </p><p>  We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came to office, to the present situation where it is creating 5,000 jobs per month.  I am currently preparing the 2014 Action Plan on behalf of the Government and we will continue, through that process, to build on the success of the actions we have taken over the last two years.</p></reply>

I am aware that there are many countries where labour rights are poor or non-existent. Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights is a fundamental feature of our foreign policy.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for International Development &ndash; One World, One Future, we are committed to ensuring that economic development is compatible with human rights, including the right to decent work.  Our engagement in this area will be informed by, among other international standards, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p><p>  In this regard, Irish Aid currently provides assistance to the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s (ILO) <i>&rsquo;Decent Work Agenda&rsquo;</i> through a partnership programme that covers the four year period 2012-2015.  The development of international labour standards is one of the most important functions of the ILO. The ILO is the only international body that is tripartite, having representatives of governments, employers and workers. The unique tripartite structure of the ILO gives an equal voice to workers, employers and governments to ensure that the views of the social partners are closely reflected in labour standards and in shaping policies and programmes.</p><p>  The ILO&rsquo;s &lsquo;Decent Work&rsquo; agenda emphasises the central role of work to people's well-being and in broader social and economic advancement.  Irish Aid will continue to support this important agenda through targeted support to the work of the ILO in Irish Aid&rsquo;s key partner countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and in priority areas agreed by the ILO and Irish Aid. Our partnership with the ILO enjoys the strong support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation.</p></reply>

Section 119 of the Act sets out the dates for payment of the Local Property Tax and clarifies that while the LPT is due by reference to a liability date, it is not payable until a later date.  Revenue recently wrote to property owners who paid their 2013 LPT by lump sum or by way of regular cash payments to ask these owners to confirm their method for paying their LPT liability for 2014.  </p><p>  For the year 2014, the liability date is 1 November 2013 and the tax is payable on or before 1 January 2014.  Where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  </p><p>  These dates have been in the public domain since December 2012 when the legislation was passed.  Questions on the 1 November liability date have been raised and responded to on several occasions, including my reply to Question No. 110 on 27 March this year.  In my replies to Questions Nos. 221 (49518/13) and 223 (49556/13) on 19 November 2013 I advised the House that having a liability date before the year commences is preferable as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax.</p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I would expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  </p><p>  I am advised that the Revenue website includes a dedicated page outlining what property owners are required to do for 2014 and this clearly states that whoever is the liable person for the property on 1 November 2013 will be responsible for paying the tax for 2014.  In addition, Revenue spokespeople have also provided clarification on this point when taking part in national and local media interviews recently.</p><p>  As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i> and on the Law Society&rsquo;s website.  Finally, I re-iterate that the liability date for 2014 of 1 November 2013 is settled and has been approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change the law in question.</p></reply>

The reduced rate shall not be set more than 50% below the standard national rate of excise duty for beer. Since 1 January 2005, Ireland applies a relief of 50% on Alcohol Products Tax in respect of qualifying beer produced in microbreweries located within the European Union.  The Directive also permits the application of reduced rates of excise duty to spirits produced by small distilleries, where production amounts to not more than 10 hectolitres (1,000 litres) of pure alcohol per annum.  However, there are no provisions currently under national legislation for this relief and, consequently, spirits produced in a micro distillery are subject to the standard rate of excise duty. </p></reply>

Any attempt to influence NAMA on this matter, would contravene Section 221 of the NAMA Act, which makes it an offence to communicate with NAMA with the intention of influencing the making of a decision in relation to the performance of its functions. This being the case it would be inappropriate for me or my officials to intervene in a private legal matter.

For example, Revenue has answered in excess of 750,000 telephone calls and replied to in excess of 210,000 letters or emails since March 2013.

Currently Revenue is experiencing very high volumes of both telephone and written correspondence for LPT, including email, and unfortunately as a consequence the standards are not being met in all circumstances.  However, Revenue has confirmed to me that significant extra resources have been deployed to deal with the volumes and it is anticipated that backlogs will be worked in the coming weeks.

The Local Property Tax (LPT) is an annual tax and has an annual pay and file season like other annual taxes.  Property owners are being asked to indicate a payment method for 2014 and Revenue is only contacting people whose payment option for 2013 does not automatically apply in 2014.  The tax is payable on or before 1 January each year, not before and the Revenue Commissioners have provided taxpayers with a range of payment options to choose from.  Credit cards and debit card transactions are effected when the transaction is made.  </p><p>  The query about credit unions is not clear but if it is in the context of payment of the LPT, as outlined above an individual does not have to pay the LPT before 1 January and the range of payment options include phased payments and payment single debit authority which will not be collected by Revenue until 21 March.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not correct that self-assessed taxpayers pay their income tax in June/July; and that LPT provides significantly more flexibility than the payment options available to such taxpayers by facilitating monthly direct debit payments, weekly/monthly deduction at source and cash payment options.</p></reply>

Using the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, we will maximise our resources to enhance growth in the Irish economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and to create employment.  Officials of my Department are currently preparing the necessary legislation which I anticipate will be enacted early next year.  Already, in the lifetime of this Government, the NPRF has established funds that support both strategic projects and a number that support SME financing.  Further assessment of the need to create a Strategic Investment Bank over and above the contribution expected from the ISIF will be informed by the requirements of the economy once the Government&rsquo;s key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach mentioned in this House that he had held discussions with Chancellor Merkel and they had agreed that work would be undertaken to find ways to reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs. The German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.  Officials of my Department have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance. Discussions with the German Ministry were held in Berlin last week and there was a meeting between Department of Finance officials and KfW personnel in Frankfurt yesterday. We will be moving forward with this work with KfW and other key stakeholders over the coming weeks both here and abroad.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s intention is to ensure with the support of Chancellor Merkel that an effective and successful initiative emerges from the process. We will therefore be discussing any and all approaches that meet the strategic objectives of both States and ultimately facilitate lending to the real economy, in particular to SMEs in Ireland.  Although the precise form and delivery mechanism for any assistance has yet to be agreed, discussion with German colleagues will consider appropriate options for funding the recovery of the Irish Economy in the course of our work with KfW and the German Government.</p></reply>

As we approach the conclusion of the Troika programme we are beginning to reap the rewards of our sustained efforts. Economic growth has returned, albeit at a slower pace than was anticipated at the start of the programme. The public finances have been put on a sustainable path and unemployment is declining steadily. Importantly, we have also successfully returned to financial market funding. The financial sector has undergone significant restructuring since the beginning of the crisis and we will continue to progress this agenda. All of this has been achieved by steadfast implementation and delivery of our commitments under the programme. This effort has encompassed the completion of over 260 actions to date. </p><p>Looking ahead the Government intends to maintain this momentum and press on with our reform agenda. That is why, together with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am preparing a Medium-Term Economic Strategy (MTES) which will set out the macroeconomic strategy and policy actions for achieving sustainable economic and employment growth for the period 2014-2020. Through a strategic, medium-term perspective, the MTES will not duplicate &ndash; but will complement &ndash; the necessarily more short-term focus of other related policy efforts such as the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>.  A publication date for the Strategy has not been decided by Government as yet, but it is intended to produce at least an outline of the strategy by mid-December.   </p></reply>

All such arrears will be collected by Revenue in the same manner as LPT.  Revenue has confirmed that the process of importing HC data from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is currently well underway.  A key part of the process involves integrating the LGMA records into Revenue&rsquo;s new Property Register, and while a significant amount of data matching is complete a considerable number of properties are yet to be cross referenced and linked</p><p>  In relation to the case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question is the registered owner of two properties.  While there is a HC payment on record for one of the properties, there is no record of any payment of HC in respect of the second property.  For this reason an additional liability of &euro;200 was added to the overall LPT/HC arrears charge in respect of the second property.</p><p>  If the person has paid the HC in respect of the second property, he should submit documentary evidence of this to LPT Branch, PO BOX 100, Ennis, Co. Clare.  Documentary evidence may be a receipt of payment or some other proof that payment was actually made.  As soon as Revenue receives the documentary proof that payment of the HC was made, the LPT Property Register will be updated to reflect this fact.  If the person has not yet paid the HC on the second property, he can do so via Revenue&rsquo;s online system, which is the easiest and most secure way to complete the transaction and can be done in tandem with choosing his LPT payment option for 2014.</p><p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s comments are noted in regard to the person&rsquo;s wish to pay his 2014 LPT/HC arrears (if applicable) liability through a payment service provider.  However, Revenue has informed me that this option is not available to the person because he is a multiple property owner and as such is required to meet his LPT and HC arrears obligations online.</p><p>  Revenue has confirmed that the person paid his 2013 LPT liability by Single Debit Authority through the online system.  Should he wish to use this option for 2014 he should complete the online version of the mandate, which will not be activated by Revenue until 21 March 2014.  Alternatively, he should select one of the other online payment options such as Direct Debit, Debit / Credit Card, or Deduction-at-Source from payroll, occupational pension, or payments from the Dept of Social Protection.</p><p>  Revenue has committed to make direct contact with the person in the coming days to discuss the various options available to him in regard to both his 2014 LPT liability and his possible arrears of HC.</p></reply>

In the case referred to by the Deputy, the 2013 LPT Return, which was filed by the person in question, contained some data errors and as a consequence the Return was listed for verification by LPT Branch.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this includes occupational pension schemes, Retirement Annuity Contracts, Personal Retirement Savings Accounts and Personal Retirement Bonds.  The levy applies to pension fund assets regardless of whether they relate to active or deferred members of schemes, and to the extent that pensions in payment are being paid directly from a defined benefit pension scheme the assets backing those pensions also come within the levy charge.</p><p>  The 0.6% levy was introduced to fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> and will be abolished from the 31st of December 2014.  I indicated in my recent Budget speech, however, that I would be introducing an additional levy on pension funds, within the existing legal framework, at 0.15% in 2014 and 2015 to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that the levy is not imposed on individual pension scheme members whether active, deferred or retired.  Rather the chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levy is, however, treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p><p>  There are very few exemptions from the levy and this, in part, explains why it was possible to introduce it at a relatively low rate of 0.6% in the first place and to keep the rate of the additional levy as low as 0.15%.  Narrowing the base of the levy would inevitably result in a greater imposition on the non-exempt schemes and I am not prepared to consider such a change.</p></reply>

In that reply I gave information relating to the changes to the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime announced in my 2014 Budget Statement and reflected in the recently published Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013.  The changes to the SFT regime outlined in the reply referred to above apply, as appropriate, to all defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors.  As regards DB pension arrangements, it is irrelevant whether an individual is a higher paid public servant or a highly paid member of a private sector DB scheme, the same SFT rules apply to all such arrangements.  The only area of difference relates to the reimbursement or recovery of chargeable excess tax by affected public servants to the pension fund administrator where the tax arises and is paid upfront by the administrator.  This arises because, unlike affected individuals in the private sector who have the flexibility to take steps (and generally do) to prevent themselves breaching the SFT or Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) if they have one so that a tax charge does not arise, public servants cannot minimise or prevent the breaching of the SFT or PFT by ceasing contributions or benefit accrual.</p><p>  Where the SFT or PFT is exceeded an immediate tax charge arises on the excess which can be significant.  I should stress that this part of the legislation does not remove or reduce the tax liability arising on a chargeable excess in such cases but provides more flexible options for the recoupment to the pension fund administrator of the tax paid.  These options involve effectively spreading the recovery of the tax, which has been paid up front by the public sector pension administrator, from the affected individual over a longer period.</p></reply>

For the year 2015, the tax will be payable on or before 1 January 2015.  The range of payment options provided by the Revenue Commissioners ensures that nobody is forced to pay LPT before that date.  The Revenue Commissioners are facilitating those who wish to exercise a personal choice to pay by debit card.  However the consequences are clearly spelled out and there are other easier and arguably more advantageous options to pay the LPT.</p><p>  The administration of the LPT, including payment of LPT for 2015 by debit card, is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners dealt with this issue comprehensively when she attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 7 November 2013.  The Chairman informed the Committee that in order to provide for a delayed payment of LPT by way of credit/debit card, Revenue would be required to retain taxpayer&rsquo;s credit/debit card data.  The Commissioners are concerned about retaining such data from a data protection perspective and other issues, including costs, also arise.  Recent well publicised data breaches arising from the retention of such data underline those concerns.  The Chairman agreed that the Commissioners would review the payment patterns for 2014 to establish the proportion of owners who choose to pay the tax by credit/debit card and they would also carefully review the issue of retaining debit/credit card data and its potential impact on systems, costs, security and data protection.</p></reply>

A breakdown of the responsibilities and staffing numbers in each area is set out in the attached Table 2. Further more detailed staffing and operational information is available on my Department's website.</p><p>  The current policy on public sector numbers means that even though this Department has already experienced a significant reduction in staffing numbers we will continue to operate in an environment of diminished resources for the foreseeable future.  At the same time demands on the education and training system and on the Department's staff have increased due to increases in numbers attending education and training courses.  The ability of the Department to continue to deliver high quality services and advance the reform agenda has only proved possible due to a high degree of collaboration, commitment and flexibility shown by my Department's staff in adopting new work practices and through co-operation with the redeployment of staff around the Department to meet fluctuating demands.  This type of working environment is an increasing feature in the Department where staff mobility and flexibility together with the introduction of new ways of working through IT developments and new business processes help the Department respond to the challenges of staffing reductions and diminished resources.</p><p>  My Department will continue to prioritise areas of activity and processes which can be reviewed/ amalgamated/discontinued to ensure a continuation of existing levels of service with reduced resources as well as working within centrally led reform projects such as shared Human Resources and Shared Payroll.</p><p><b>Table 1:</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>Management &amp;amp; Organisation </th><th>- </th><th>-</th><th>Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;</th><th>- </th><th></th><th>-</th><th>- </th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td> -</td><td></td><td></td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td> -</td><td></td><td></td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td> -</td><td></td><td></td><td> -</td><td></td><td></td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td> -</td><td></td><td> -</td><td></td><td></td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td><td> -</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td></td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2:</b><table><tr><th>Area of responsibility/section</th><th>RESPONSIBILITIES</th><th>Staffing Number (FTE)</th></tr><tr><td>Management Advisory Committee (MAC) which includes inter alia the Secretary General as well as the Chief Inspector</td><td>Providing strategic direction and overseeing the administration of public education and training in Ireland. </td><td>11.00</td></tr><tr><td>Secretary General&rsquo;s Office/MAC Support </td><td>Secretarial service for the Secretary General and other members of the Management Advisory Committee.

This advice sheet covers areas such as what tablets can offer a school, educational considerations, purchasing considerations and software.  Should a school wish to adopt tablet devices it is an operational matter for the Board of Management of the school.  I would add that where new technology is being adopted by schools consultation should take place prior to the decision being made. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Management. As it is a matter for school management whether to adopt tablets my Department does not keep statistics in this area.

Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.  Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>  In addition to the student grant, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The report outlines opinions expressed at a series of meetings and also identifies issues for consideration by the schools' patron body.  I met with local representatives and parents' representatives from the area concerned earlier this year to hear their views in relation to their suggestion that the schools might be configured on a junior school/senior school basis as opposed to the planned two fully vertical post-primary schools.</p><p>  I fully considered the views presented to me at the meeting and I also examined all of the factors relevant to the matter.  I am confident that the schools can operate successfully as two vertical schools.  I consider this to be the optimum configuration for the two schools concerned and indeed the best provision that can be made for the pupils in the area in question.</p><p>  The existing school in the area, under the patronage of the local Education and Training Board, is very highly regarded locally.  The intention of the Education and Training Board is that the new community college would replicate and achieve the high standards and success attained in the existing school.  The synergies generated by the new campus environment should be a significant benefit to both schools towards building on the success of the existing school and should assist them both in attaining high standards.  The management and governance structures for the Education Campus that have been developed by the Education and Training Board, seek to ensure that the necessary appropriate relationships and close co-operation will exist between the two schools at all levels, from the Principals and the Boards of Management through to the pupils and the staff.</p></reply>

The company has pointed out that enhanced quality and efficiencies of the new generations of aircraft engines &ndash; with reduced need for overhaul &ndash; has impacted on their business with fewer engines becoming available for service.  There are also complex changes in the dynamics of aircraft maintenance worldwide, which have knock-on impacts in facilities such as those in Ireland. </p><p>  Lufthansa are fully aware of the productive nature of the Rathcoole site and of its skilled workforce, but the decisions taken &ndash; while devastating for the employees and families of those affected &ndash;if closure proceeds, are purely commercial and based on wider market conditions.  As you will appreciate, the ultimate decision in these cases is made by the parent company, on strictly commercial grounds, and on what is seen by the company as being in the best interests of the group as a whole. </p><p>  I have met senior executives of the company on three occasions since taking office and IDA have been engaged with them over recent years in an effort to find solutions to the difficult business environment they face.  Unfortunately the challenges are very significant.  Since the announcement, IDA Ireland has met with company management with a view to creating a profile of the Rathcoole plant, and of the workforce and their skills, for marketing purposes by IDA&rsquo;s global team.  IDA will remain in on-going contact with the companies during the coming months.  In addition, I have arranged that Enterprise Ireland will engage with the company to explore whatever other options might be possible, taking into account that Agency&rsquo;s remit and experience in supporting the Irish-owned engineering sector.</p><p>  I am conscious of the highly-skilled workforces and have asked IDA to explore the possibility of securing a takeover or buy-out for either company.  I want to assure the Deputy that all that can be done by the State&rsquo;s agencies in an effort to secure a positive result for the employees at both companies is being done and will continue to be done, including any appropriate upskilling of the employees affected.</p></reply>

This programme offers valuable opportunities to researchers and companies based in Ireland to participate in high-quality research collaborations with their European counterparts, with the support of EU funding.  All companies, micro, small, medium, large, profit/non-profit making, public-private partnerships and service providers can participate in almost all Framework Programme 7 activities and are actively encouraged to do so. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is the Irish agency responsible for helping Irish companies and researchers to participate in FP7.  Due to the nature of the ongoing application, evaluation, award and contract negotiation stages of the FP7 process it is not practicable to give an annual breakdown of the number of enterprises receiving support.  In the period from commencement of FP7 in January 2007 to July 2013, over 2000 applications from Irish-based companies took part in FP7 proposals requesting European funding.  From these submissions, and through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s facilitation and financial support, over 500 applications have been successful with awards amounting to &euro;149 million accounting for 26% of all funding to Irish researchers from FP7.  Ireland&rsquo;s total drawdown in FP7 (as of July this year for which latest figures are available) currently stands at &euro;572m and we are on course to achieve our national target of &euro;600m from this important source of non-Exchequer funding.  It should be noted that funding under FP7 is awarded on a competitive basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-27a.260.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112700070#WRN00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</p><p>  The latest data from the CSO shows that in the year to September 2013, there was an increase of 3.2%, or 58,000 people, in employment.  Unemployment has fallen from 13.6% to 12.8%, and youth unemployment has decreased from 31.1% to 26.5% over the year to September 2013.</p><p>  In terms of indigenous industry, Enterprise Ireland recognises the significant unemployment challenge facing communities throughout Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland works with its clients throughout the country to help to drive employment creation.  Enterprise Ireland employs a holistic, developmental approach and engages client companies across all aspects of the value chain. Enterprise Ireland works with clients on business development, sales and marketing capabilities, innovation and R&amp;amp;D activity, technology development, continuous competitiveness and lean improvements, on-going leadership and management development, and access to finance. </p><p>  In 2012, total employment in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies increased to 169,451, made up of 145,460 in full time jobs and 23,991 in part-time positions.  This positive performance by Irish companies was achieved notwithstanding the continuing economic challenges at home and abroad. The total direct and indirect employment impact associated with Enterprise Ireland client companies is estimated to total more than 300,000 jobs.</p><p>  The companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a vital source of employment in every county in Ireland; in 2012 almost two-thirds of jobs in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies were outside of Dublin.  In December 2011 Forf&aacute;s published the South East Employment Action Plan to help address the high unemployment rate facing that region.  This was followed by the development of an action plan for the Mid-West region following the decision to restructure the tourism and enterprise support agencies in the region. Enterprise Ireland is targeting the creation of 12,000 new jobs in 2014.</p><p>  The Foreign Direct Investment sector is a major contributor to the Irish economy, with 1,000+ companies, employing over 150,000 people and generating &euro;122bn in exports per annum. In addition, because Irelands FDI focus and competitive advantage is concentrated on high technology sectors requiring high education and skill levels, a high proportion of FDI employment and new employee take up is from young people with third level education qualifications.</p><p>  In addition to the direct employment impact of FDI, it also generates a substantial downstream spill over employment impact, via employment in construction, facility maintenance, services suppliers, and the spending of wages/salaries and tax revenues in the economy. A study by Indecon consultants in 2010 for Forfas estimated this indirect employment impact to be about 70% of the direct employment impact. Again a significant amount of this indirect employment contributes to reducing youth unemployment in the economy.</p><p>  The FDI sector also impacts very positively on the Irish economy via the large amount of R&amp;amp;D being carried out by IDA Ireland client companies, with wide ranging positive effects on employment across the economy, much of it highly qualified young people. IDA Ireland is targeting the creation of 12,000 new jobs in 2014.</p><p>  Despite the significant job losses in manufacturing up to 2010, there are now 205,700 people directly employed in the sector in Ireland, and a similar number of people employed indirectly: the total supported within the sector is therefore just over 400,000.  In 2012, in order to build on the potential for this sector I asked Forf&aacute;s to undertake an analysis of Manufacturing in Ireland and the resultant Strategy, which I launched earlier this year, sets a comprehensive suite of recommendations to develop the sector, which are now being progressed. The Strategy identifies that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in Manufacturing by 2016.  The tide is already turning, as in the years 2011 and 2012 there was a net increase of 3,700 jobs in the Manufacturing sector. Some of the other more detailed statistics requested by the Deputy are not readily available. </p><p>  A particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. The further development of the sector will, of course, build on this key feature. In addition, the wider economic indicators are now looking quite positive.  The Private Sector is creating an overall 3,000 jobs every month as our competitiveness improves and consumer confidence slowly returns. This is a dramatic recovery from the position of a few years ago.</p><p>  The role of the County Enterprise Boards is to promote entrepreneurship, company start-ups and expansion, and job creation at local level. In 2012 the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards created 4,858 new full time jobs, and are expecting to create a similar number in 2013 and 2014.</p><p>  The Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, together with the Enterprise Ireland, is also examining options for CEB-led initiatives aimed at promoting youth entrepreneurship, including a mix of financial supports for business start-ups, feasibility studies and mentoring. </p><p><b><i>Background Information</i></b></p><p><b><i>Programmes aimed at youth &amp;amp; regional entrepreneurship</i></b></p><p><b><i>Enterprise Ireland Graduate Programmes</i></b></p><p>  Enterprise Ireland currently has two graduate development programmes which are primarily focussed at the under 25 age group (less than 2 years post graduation) &ndash; The Innovate Programme delivered by WIT and the Graduates 4 International Growth Programme (G4IG). These posts are targeted at graduates with a 2.2 or higher grade average and less than 2 years post graduation experience. The programmes provide a company with a capable graduate to work in their business (International Markets or R&amp;amp;D) while getting a graduate development post grad qualification at the IMI/NUIC or WIT. The graduate&rsquo;s employment costs are subsidised for up to 18 months.</p><p> - To date 119 companies have hired 127 graduates with support from Enterprise Ireland in identifying, employing and training graduates in Internationalisation.</p><p> - The G4IG 2013 programme is currently open for recruitment.  Approximately 300 recent graduates are currently registered for the programme which has 35 companies approved with 46 positions.</p><p> - Eight companies employing eight graduates are taking part in the pilot technovation graduate programme in Waterford IT.</p><p><b><i>Other programmes with a youth focus</i></b></p><p>  Nurturing tomorrow&rsquo;s entrepreneurs Sowing the seeds of entrepreneurship and exposing students to the fundamentals of business is an integral part of promoting an entrepreneurial culture. Enterprise Ireland coordinated and supported a number of the initiatives in 2012 to promote youth entrepreneurship and engagement in the world of hi-tech. These included CoderDojo, an Irish-led movement that is teaching kids globally to code, and our annual Think Outside the Box awards, which aim to foster a spirit of entrepreneurship among third level students</p><p><b><i>Competitive Start Fund </i></b></p><p>  The purpose of the Competitive Start Fund is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capability to succeed in global markets. The fund is designed to enable those companies reach key commercial and technical milestones, for example:</p><p> - Evaluate overseas market opportunities and reach firm conclusions regarding the viability of the proposed business.</p><p>- Build a prototype.</p><p>- Secure a reference site.</p><p>- Develop a market entry plan for exploiting international opportunities.</p><p>- Secure partnership deal or strategic alliance.</p><p>- Identify suitable channels to international markets.</p><p>- Secure third party investment e.g. business angel, Venture Capital.</p><p>  The CSF is open to entrepreneurs establishing early-stage businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. As with all EI supports, there are no set age limits, and there is a modest level of investment from the promoter required to avail of EI funding. As such, the CSF can represent an opportunity for youth entrepreneurs to avail of seed funding where the proposed project has international potential. </p><p><b><i>Think Outside The Box Awards</i></b></p><p>  The Think Outside the Box Awards is aimed at third level students with a novel idea for a new business. Focusing on the development of business ideas with real commercial potential the provides cash prizes and the opportunity to avail of &euro;30,000 worth of specialist advice and assistance to potentially help turn the enterprise idea into a business reality. The awards are sponsored by Enterprise Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland, Intel, Cruickshank Intellectual Property Attorneys and Grant Thornton. The Think Outside The Box Awards have an exclusive focus on third level students, from all academic disciplines and courses of study, and offer the opportunity to realise entrepreneurial ambitions. </p><p>  Be part of Ireland getting back on its feet and help to drive the economy by commercialising your business ideas and considering starting your own business as a viable career option. Submissions for the awards are accepted all year round and both Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI business mentors are available to help to develop the business idea.</p><p>  Given the focus of the Awards (3rd level), a significant number of the participants are in the youth entrepreneur cohort. Former winners have gone on to participate in business start-ups, and have availed of EI support.</p><p><b><i>New Frontiers</i></b></p><p>  New Frontiers is Ireland&rsquo;s national entrepreneur development programme that is delivered at a local level by the Institutes of Technology. For those with an innovative business idea and planning to establish and run your own company, the New Frontiers Entrepreneur Development Programme can provide a package of supports to help accelerate business development and to equip entrepreneurs with the skills and contacts needed to successfully start and grow your company.</p><p>  New Frontiers provides Entrepreneurs with:</p><p> - Training in all areas of business including financial management, market research &amp;amp; validation, business process, patenting, product development, sales training.</p><p> - Mentoring from experienced business advisers and practitioners.</p><p> - Office and other business incubation facilities.</p><p> - &euro;15,000 scholarship to cover full-time participation in the six month course.</p><p> - Networking with other entrepreneurs and business development agencies.</p><p> - Introductions to seed and early stage capital investment networks.</p><p> - Access to entrepreneurship best practice, both national and international.</p><p> - Peer-group learning from participants in the region and across the country.</p><p> - Access to the expertise in Enterprise Ireland through our Market Research Centre.</p><p> - Expertise from the Institutes of Technology and the supportive environment of their business incubation centres.</p><p>  Launched in February 2012, the New Frontiers Entrepreneur Development Programme aims to support the creation of 100 high value, knowledge based, Irish owned businesses, each year. The programme can represent a good avenue for youth entrepreneurs with an innovative business idea to develop and hone their plans and develop an investor ready proposition. </p><p><b><i>FoodWorks</i></b></p><p>  Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc are working together on a food sector entrepneurship programme which offers access to a range of supports including assistance in developing the business proposition, market research, and advice on business financing and supplier development.</p><p>  The County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) throughout the country provide supports, both financial and non-financial or &quot;soft&quot; supports, to all micro-enterprises in the start-up or expansion phase in manufacturing and services, subject to certain conditions. The soft supports include the provision of business advice, training and mentoring to all clients. The aim is to develop indigenous enterprise potential, stimulate economic activity at local level and promote the establishment of micro-enterprises within their administrative area. These supports are available to everyone, regardless of age.</p><p>  IDA Ireland is also actively supporting the recent Pathways to Work initiative and in this regard:</p><p>-  Has recently agreed a protocol with DSP to enhance cooperation on increasing the possibilities for unemployed persons to take up job opportunities in FDI companies</p><p>-  Is actively using the DSP unemployment databases for marketing to clients in relation to specific projects. Over the last four months IDA Ireland has requested DSP data in relation to five individual projects.</p><p>-  Is liaising closely with FAS/Solas on putting in place focused training initiatives that can effectively and quickly bridge any skills gaps remaining among unemployed persons identified using DSP data bases. </p><p>-  Is actively marketing JobBridge internships and the recently introduced JobsPlus incentives to client companies.</p></reply>

While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency supported companies, the total number of jobs lost in 2012 was 7,815; the number of jobs gained in 2012 was 14,187.  Therefore the total <i>net new full-time jobs</i> created in the agency supported service industry for 2012 is 6,372. This is very positive growth. The<i> Action Plan for Jobs 2012</i> included a series of actions across a wide number of sectors including manufacturing and services. By implementing the 2012 and 2013 Action<i> Plans for Jobs</i> and the new 2014 <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>  , to be developed in the New Year, the Government is confident that further growth in employment in both sectors will be achieved. </p><p>  It is,  of course, self-evident that with greater globalisation,  reduction of tariff barriers and with the ease of transporting goods,  that patterns will be changing and there will an inevitable movement of production of lower cost, less specialised  goods towards cheaper labour countries, especially in Asia.  This is part of a wider global pattern. Although it is very challenging in an internationally competitive environment, there is considerable potential for the manufacturing and services sectors in Ireland, as we are strongly placed to create opportunities and employment in many higher skilled, higher-value sub sectors, where we have a competitive advantage and it is important we concentrate on these areas and maintain our natural advantages.  This will assist in our work of attracting Foreign Direct Investment.  </p><p>  In addition, the wider economic indicators are now looking quite positive.  The Private Sector is creating an overall 3,000 jobs every month as our competitiveness improves and consumer confidence slowly returns. This is a dramatic recovery from the position of a few years ago.</p><p>  The<i> Action Plan for Jobs </i>includes a series of actions across a wide number of sectors including manufacturing and services.

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that IDA Ireland&rsquo;s mid-year results, announced in July last, showed that foreign direct investment into Ireland was very strong in the first half of this year.  During this period, there was an increased number of investments, with approximately 7,000 associated jobs to be created as companies implement and complete their investment plants.  This trend represents a continuation on the strong performance announced by IDA Ireland at the end of 2012, during which year, in excess of 12,000 jobs were created by multinational companies.  The 2012 results represented the third consecutive year of growth in net employment in IDA Ireland client companies.  </p><p>  Work in winning new investments has been continuing steadily in the second half of 2013 and, on the basis of the trends so far, I am confident that the targets set out for IDA Ireland in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, of winning more than 130 new investments, securing &euro;500m in R&amp;amp;D and creating 13,000 jobs in IDA client companies, will be achieved.  Among the companies who announced job creation plans or fresh investment plans to date in 2013, were: Ebay, EMC, McAfee, Pfizer, Sanofi, Symantec, Zurich, Huawei, Yahoo, Facebook, Vistakon, Guidewire, Squarespace, Groupon, Qualcomm, Novartis, Nypro, AOL FireEye, and Deutsche Bank.</p><p>  IDA Ireland is nearing completion of the fourth of its five year Horizon 2020 strategy and the latest results put the organisation ahead of target in meeting its goal of creating 62,000 direct jobs by 2014 from 640 new investments. Over the course of the first three years (2010-2012) IDA has secured 419 investments and has delivered gross job gains of over 36,000.</p><p><b>Table showing data relating to FDI performance from 2007 to 2012</b><table><tr><th><b>Employment Data</b></th><th><b>2007</b></th><th><b>2008</b></th><th><b>2009</b></th><th><b>2010</b></th><th><b>2011</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Permanent Employment </b></td><td>140,369</td><td>139,457</td><td>126,866</td><td>126,305</td><td>130,867</td><td>136,505</td></tr><tr><td><b>Other Jobs </b></td><td>15,939</td><td>13,453</td><td>11,788</td><td>13,976</td><td>15,348</td><td>16,280</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total Number Employed</b></td><td>156,308</td><td>152,910</td><td>138,654</td><td>140,281</td><td>146,215</td><td>152,785</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-27a.276.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112700071#WRO00300"><p>I am acutely aware of the difficulties that upward only rent reviews cause for some businesses who had signed their leases before such clauses were abolished on 28th February 2010.  The Forf&aacute;s report &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo;, which was published on 8th April 2013 last, indicates that business costs have reduced significantly in recent years with overall price levels in the economy falling back to levels last experienced in 2002.  The improvement in business cost competitiveness has been driven by dramatic reductions in property related costs (in terms of purchase and rent levels) and falling prices across a range of professional and business services.</p><p>  However, the Government has taken steps to address the issue where possible.  In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property.  NAMA has published its policy guidance which will inform the approach to be taken where relevant tenants are experiencing difficulties in paying rents.  Under the Guidance Note, which NAMA published in December 2011, it has to date approved rent abatements proposed by its debtors and receivers with an aggregate annual value of in excess of &euro;17m.  NAMA has refused only 10 of the 312 applications received to date.</p><p>  The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs also includes a number of specific actions to support a sustainable commercial property market, including ensuring that the commercial leases database is established and fully operational in 2013.  The Commercial Leases Database was published by the Property Services Regulatory Authority on 31st October, 2013.  The total number of leases entered into since 1 January 2010 to 31st October 2013 is 24,747.  </p><p>  The Commercial Leases Database is available on the Property Services Regulatory Authority website:   .  It will bring much-needed transparency to the commercial property market and will empower both landlords and tenants to reach a commercially informed decision when negotiating new leases, dealing with rent reviews, and lease restructuring and renewals. </p><p>  In relation to the rent review issue in historic leases, the Government has repeatedly urged that maximum flexibility be shown during the course of rent negotiations and has called upon all parties to act responsibly and in a way which takes full account of the broader national interest.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs recognises the importance of the retail sector to the economy and the 2013 Action Plan contains a number of measures aimed at supporting that sector.  These include an initiative to increase the number of small businesses trading on-line and an initiative to streamline business licence application procedures. Employers in the retail sector can also avail of the JobsPlus initiative which provides financial assistance to employers who recruit people who have been out of work for 12 months or more.  The Government has also established an Interdepartmental Group to consider further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which are currently being considered for inclusion in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>  The Government attaches great importance to a thriving retail and commercial sector, and is committed to supporting these sectors wherever support is feasible. Continuing action is being taken across Government to reduce the costs of doing business, which is intended to have a positive impact on areas such as energy, local authority rates, and the administrative burden involved in companies complying with Government regulations and tax systems.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-27a.279.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112700071#WRO00500"><p>I believe that the policies being pursued by my Department are making a positive impact in supporting enterprises and job creation.  Despite international and domestic difficulties, there has been an annual increase of 3.2% in employment of 58,000 people.  Unemployment has fallen from 13.6% to 12.8%, and youth unemployment has decreased from 31.1% to 26.5% over the year to September 2013.</p><p>  The Government is committed to addressing the problem of employment, and in particular, youth unemployment. Our primary strategy is to create the environment for economic recovery through competitiveness, enterprise and job creation through the Action Plan for Jobs. In addition, the Government recognises the need for measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in Pathways to Work, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.</p><p>  Pathways to Work programmes such as JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum, JobsPlus and the ICT Action Plan, are delivered by the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  The Department of Social Protection is also working with relevant Departments, including my own, to produce a concrete plan for implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Ireland, for consideration by the Government before being transmitted to the European Commission by the end of the year.</p><p>  My Department is also keen to support young entrepreneurs and, in this context, current initiatives such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund and New Frontiers Programme, along with the Microenterprise Loan Fund, all contribute to supporting young entrepreneurs. In 2014, the CEBs will also place a focus on supporting entrepreneurship among young people.</p><p>  More than 48,000 jobs will be created in 2014 through supports from my Department as a result of the measures announced in Budget 2014. Some of the specific measures announced include:</p><p> - A package of new initiatives to support start-ups and growing businesses, including Start Your Own Business Scheme &ndash; a 2-year income tax exemption for long-term unemployed people who start their own business,</p><p> - A total of &euro;18.5m for CEBs to support enterprise development, an increase of &euro;3.5m on the Budget 2013 Estimate.</p><p> - Continued provision for a total of over &euro;2billion in non-bank credit schemes for business.</p><p>  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards companies had their best performance in many years, with the agencies&rsquo; clients creating just over 30,000 new jobs between them last year.  The services and supports of these Agencies are available to both indigenous and FDI companies throughout County Kildare. </p><p>  The County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) throughout the country provide supports, both financial and non-financial or &ldquo;soft&rdquo; supports, to all micro-enterprises in the start-up or expansion phase in manufacturing and services, subject to certain conditions. The soft supports include the provision of business advice, mentoring and training to all clients. The aim is to develop indigenous enterprise potential, stimulate economic activity at local level and promote the establishment of micro-enterprises within their administrative area.</p><p>  Anyone interested in starting or expanding their own business should in the first instance contact their local County and City Enterprise Board (CEB). Contact details for Kildare CEB are available on .</p><p>  Tables 1 to 3 below provide information in relation to County Kildare on IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Kildare CEB activities.</p><p>Table 1: IDA Ireland &ndash; Jobs created<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Employment Data</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Jobs Created</td><td>113</td><td>30</td><td>1,228</td><td>398</td><td>176</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 2:  Enterprise Ireland Jobs created<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Job Data</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Jobs Created </td><td>351</td><td>476</td><td>295</td><td>1,082</td><td>534</td></tr></table></p><p>  Table 3: CEB Employment Statistics 2011 and 2012<table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>2012</th><th>-</th><th>2011</th></tr><tr><td>CEB</td><td>Full Time Gains</td><td>Other Time Gains</td><td>Full Time Gains</td><td>Other Time Gains</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>133</td><td>77</td><td>106</td><td>135</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The aim of rent supplement is to provide short term income assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have come into force with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014. The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  The Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector so it is essential that the rent limits are kept under review. The new rent limits have been set using the 35th percentile to ensure that sufficient housing is available for recipients of the scheme. </p><p>  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway while there have been some reductions across a number of counties, reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties. Officials continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that rent supplement tenants&rsquo; accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs.</p></reply>

The Scandinavian child care model, while being a very comprehensive model, is also a very expensive model. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA) estimates that the cost of universal child care provision in Ireland could reach around &euro;1 billion per annum.  In light of the current fiscal environment, this level of funding is not available.</p><p>  The early childhood care and education (ECCE) programme is a universal programme implemented by the D/CYA and provides a free pre-school year for all eligible children before they commence primary school. Approximately &euro;175 million is provided annually to support the programme. In the school year 2012/2013 approximately 68,000 children availed of the free pre-school provision.  The community child care subvention scheme is operated by D/CYA and supports in excess of 25,000 children, across some 1,000 community/not-for-profit child care providers. Under this scheme child care providers charge reduced fees to disadvantaged and low-income parents. Access to affordable child care is one of the key supports required by customers of the Department of Social Protection when entering employment. Customers of the Department can access the ECCE programme, the CCS programme, the child care education and training scheme (CETS) and the after school child care (ASCC) scheme.</p><p>  The purpose of the After-school Child Care scheme (ASCC) is to help offset some of the after-school child care costs that are associated with availing of an employment opportunity. The scheme supports those who are unemployed as well as OFP recipients and is funded from the transfer of savings from my Department to the D/CYA. </p><p>  The ASCC scheme was piloted during 2013 and following a review of the pilot, I have the agreed with Minister Fitzgerald to re-focus the funding for 2014.  This will allow for a new strand of child care support for customers of my Department who are participating in the community employment (CE) scheme. This new child care support will provide an additional 1,800 places on top of the existing 2,800 places, which are currently available under the child care education and training support (CETS) scheme that is administered by the D/CYA. The CETS provides subsidised child care places to clients of my Department participating in education, training and now community employment programmes. </p><p>  In addition the ASCC scheme is now available nationally and will provide 800 subsidised after-school child care places in 2014. The allocation of places, funding for the scheme, and the design of the scheme itself will be monitored and reviewed &ndash; as appropriate &ndash; during 2014.</p></reply>

If they are dissatisfied with the decision of the broadcaster, they can refer the matter to the BAI. Details relating to the complaints process are available on the BAI web-site at .  With regard to podcasts of radio programmes, the position is that the BAI does not have any regulatory power in respect of on-line content, including on-line content provided by broadcasters.

These Regulations, which build on the commercial food waste regulations introduced in 2009, are designed to promote the segregation and recovery of household food waste, in line with the national policy and the Waste Framework Directive objectives of maximising the resource which can be extracted from waste and minimising the disposal of waste.  They will increase the amount of food waste that is recovered through the production of energy, compost and digestate, thereby creating opportunities for added jobs and value. The Regulations will also facilitate the achievement of the targets set out in the Landfill Directive (Directive 99/31/EC) for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill sites, by directing source-segregated household food waste to composting and to other forms of treatment.   </p><p>  The Regulations impose obligations on both householders and waste collectors. Householders are obliged to segregate their food waste, and make it available for separate collection. Alternatively householders may compost the food waste at home; or bring it themselves to authorised treatment facilities (such as civic amenity sites or anaerobic digestion sites).   </p><p>  In respect of the end-product from the treatment of food waste as it relates to the purpose of energy production, policy measures and strategy in relation to the production of biogas for bio-fuel are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. However, I understand that academic and industry research suggest there is a potentially significant role for biogas and biomethane in meeting our renewable energy requirements, particularly in the challenging heat and transport sectors and biogas can be utilised to generate electricity, heat or as a transport fuel.</p><p>  There are already a number of supports in place for the use of biogas. Electricity production using anaerobic digestion of biodegradable feedstock, including food waste, is supported under the REFIT 3 scheme, with 50MW of the 310MW dedicated to this technology. REFIT 3 in its support for combined heat and power also supports the generation of renewable heat from such feedstock. In the transport sector, biogas may also be used to meet the obligations set under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.   </p><p>  Given the relatively early stage of technology development and cost, detailed economic analysis is required before any additional supports for biogas and biomethane appropriate to Ireland can be considered. This analysis will be carried forward in the context of implementing the forthcoming Bioenergy Strategy which is currently being finalised by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p></reply>

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including determination under the Act of relevant property for the purposes of rates. The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   </p><p>  Under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property. The making of such a scheme is subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.   </p><p>  Any application received for a rate waiver scheme is carefully considered. However, in considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on existing businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs. In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses who are not part of the scheme, as it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates. This could impose an additional burden on such ratepayers in what are already difficult economic circumstances.   </p></reply>

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   </p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014. Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed.   </p><p>  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. This decision has been taken in the context of Budget 2014. The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced in due course.   </p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.   </p></reply>

Both agencies are working together to develop a strategy which ensures a more targeted response to women offenders including:</p><p> -  identifying and diverting women at risk of a custodial sentence through greater use of community sanctions, supports and inter-agency co-operation;</p><p> - strengthening early intervention measures in the community through adopting a co-ordinated multi-agency approach;</p><p> - improving outcomes for women currently in custody;</p><p> - exploring the potentials of women centric alternatives to custody;</p><p> - development of a suitable step down facility for women offenders;</p><p> - enhanced co-operation with the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>  In September 2012, I announced the establishment of a Working Group to conduct a Strategic Review of Penal Policy.  In line with a recommendation of the Thornton Hall Review Group which reported in 2012, the Working Group has been asked to carry out an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy incorporating an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including the issue of female prisoners.  This Review is ongoing and the Working Group is expected to report early next year.</p></reply>

Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purposes of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so.</p><p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to distance sales of alcohol in its 2008 Report.  The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made as part of the telephone or on-line transaction in such cases and not later on delivery of the product.  It considered that the sales of alcohol products involving payment by the consumer on delivery do not comply with the existing statutory provisions and are, therefore, illegal.</p><p>  Any complaints relating to the sale or delivery of alcohol received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the subject of investigation and offenders dealt with in accordance with the law.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

Members are paid these allowances on a 28 day roster basis, in arrears, with the payment process commencing at the beginning of each pay roster period in respect of work carried out during the previous period.  There are 13 such periods in each year and there are 13 payments made each year to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na based on individual claims submitted by members.  There are no plans at present to change this arrangement.</p><p>  The majority of members receive this payment on the third Thursday after the end of a particular roster period.  In the case of the period which ends on 8 December, this would be due to be paid on 26 December.  However, the year-end payrolls are brought forward due to such matters as extra bank holidays which occur during the Christmas and New Year periods, the testing of new computer software to cater for any budgetary changes, inputting of payroll reference data changes for 2014<b></b>and the high volume of payroll administration required at the Financial Year End.  This in turn means that the payroll date of 26 December<b></b>has to be brought forward to 19 December.  The payroll data for that pay date must be submitted by 6 December 2013.</p><p>  The practice outlined above has always been the case and is not a new development.  Garda members always have  received and will continue to receive 13 payments each year for 13 four week periods.  It must also be remembered that with regard to normal salary payments, Garda&iacute; are paid on a weekly basis and will receive their pay up to and including the pay day of 26<sup></sup>  December before the end of the year.  In fact, they will receive their salary payment for the paydays of 19 and 26 December in advance of Christmas on 17 and 19 December respectively.</p></reply>

The application is currently being processed and once completed will be returned to the registered organisation concerned.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is now approximately 7 weeks from date of receipt.  However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  Nonetheless, this is a significant improvement on the processing time of 14 weeks which existed in July this year.  This improvement reflects the fact that I have given this matter particular priority as it is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and efficiently.</p><p>  In that context, I have been actively engaged on this issue with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Garda Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 136 whole time equivalent staff assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013.  Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks.  Furthermore, I have also received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU.  This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170, more than double that of the average allocation of 78 staff at the Unit over the past two and a half years.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the development of an e-Vetting solution is underway.  This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.</p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review process.  There are significant costs in operating and maintaining an extensive estate of properties around the country, both in terms of the staff who must attend these locations and the cost of maintaining the buildings themselves and providing appropriate facilities in them. In allocating resources the Courts Service must prioritise venues which are regularly used and which have the highest workload.</p><p>  During the course of 2012 the Courts Service completed a comprehensive review of all venues throughout the country. The purpose of this review was to establish a framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking account of a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc. This review identified a range of venues nationwide which based on the criteria applied could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue. In this regard, the Courts Service has indicated that the identification of venues as part of the review process will not necessarily mean that the identified venues will close.</p><p>  I am informed that the Courts Service in considering any venue for closure undertakes an analysis of the costs associated with the holding of court sittings in a venue. This includes an assessment of both operational costs, such as courthouse maintenance and lighting &amp;amp; heating, and travel and subsistence costs in respect of the judiciary, courts staff and Garda&iacute;. The Courts Service has assured me no decision in relation to the future of any court venue will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users. This consultation process has commenced and the views expressed in that process will be taken into account in the decision making process which will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.</p></reply>

During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place. The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows those who held a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt before the commencement of the Act to continue with an adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country for a maximum period of three years.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must have completed the process by the 31st October 2013. </p><p>   One particular concern that has coincided with the expiry of the transitional provisions provided for in Section 63 of the Adoption Act 2010, is the position of a  small number of applicants who were at a late stage in adopting from Russia when changes to Russian legislation were enacted which meant that they were unable to complete the adoption of identified children before 31 October, 2013.  It is my understanding that in order to adopt from Russia it is necessary to have a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt on the date of the court hearing to finalise the adoption, and for a specified period thereafter before the Court order takes effect. In order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. </p><p>  The advice of the Attorney General was sought and my Department is currently examining legislative options that might assist,  possibly through the retrospective extension of the declarations of eligibility and suitability concerned. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act must be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is examining if it is possible to address this situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention.

The recommendations are as follows:</p><p>1. The need to identify clinical pathways relating to management of women with an intrauterine death in third trimester to complement existing medical management policy.</p><p>2. The Guidelines for Medical Management of Intrauterine Death should be revised in line with a review of the medical literature. </p><p>3. Details of all patients for Induction of Labour, regardless of place of induction should be centrally documented. </p><p>4. This recommendation cannot be disclosed as it contains personal, private, sensitive and confidential  information relating to the individual patient.</p><p>5. Develop a brief operational outline of the Gynaecology Department to assist staff who are sent there on an occasional/intermittent basis.</p><p>6. Due to the complexity of work, there is a need for an updated training needs analysis of all midwifery and nursing staff on the gynaecology ward.</p><p>7. There should be a designated individual with responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and auditing the Basic Life Support attendance and Advanced Life Support Skills attendance, ideally a designated Resuscitation Training Officer. </p><p>8. An Obstetric Early Warning System should be introduced and evaluated.</p><p>9. Install additional phone lines in the ward.</p><p>10. A review of the possibility of emergency call bells or designated phones for emergencies in each room should be carried out and measures taken to address this.</p><p>11. Hospital wide analysis of all doorways in clinical areas to establish the feasibility of moving a bed in a critical event.</p><p>I have been informed by the HSE that the Rotunda Hospital has implemented all 11 recommendations.</p><p>  It is my expectation that patients should be informed of all the risks to themselves arising from any medical procedure to which they give informed consent.</p></reply>

I would like to note at the outset that the figure of 29% of the population smoking, quoted by the OECD in their report, was sourced from the 2007 SLAN study. However, the latest figures from the National Tobacco Control Office in the HSE (collected in June 2012), show that 22% of the Irish population now  smoke.</p><p><i>  Tobacco Free Ireland</i>, which I launched on 3 October 2013, sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.  Tobacco Free Ireland sets out over 60 recommendations with the overall aims of denormalising smoking in our society, protecting children from the harms of tobacco, enforcing, regulating and legislating for tobacco activities and products, educating about the dangers of tobacco and assisting those who smoke in stopping.  </p><p>  An extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on the 24th October 2013.  The aim is to reduce our per capita consumption of alcohol to the OECD average (9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita) by 2020.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the National Substance Misuse Strategy report 2012. The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for:</p><p>- minimum unit pricing for alcohol products;</p><p>- the regulation of advertising and marketing of alcohol;</p><p>- structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets;</p><p>- health labelling of alcohol products; and</p><p>- regulation of sports sponsorship.</p><p>  Work is continuing in my Department on the implementation of the recommendations in <i>Tobacco Free Ireland </i> and the drafting of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures have been developed under the Healthy Ireland framework.  <i>Healthy Ireland </i> is a government framework, which sets out a vision that will improve the health and wellbeing of all the population of Ireland over the next 12 years.  It puts forward a &ldquo;whole of society&rdquo; approach and new arrangements to ensure more effective co-operation to achieve better outcomes for all.</p></reply>

At my request, the HSE has established a senior-level team which, in the course of 2013, has been working intensively with every acute hospital to ensure implementation of the measures necessary to achieve EWTD compliance.</p><p>  Under a set of proposals agreed under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission in October 2013, the Irish Medical Organisation  is now jointly involved with health service national management in an ongoing process to assess the position in each hospital site and agree focused and timebound requirements to resolve outstanding issues.  Data for the third quarter of 2013 indicates that 97% of NCHDs now work fewer than 68 hours per week and that 53% are working shifts not exceeding 24 hours.  These figures represent a significant improvement on the position at the beginning of the year.  I am determined to continue the steady progress being made in addressing this long standing problem.  The establishment of Hospital Groups over the coming months will also assist in this regard.</p></reply>

As of 1 October, there are 258 health insurance products on the market, of which 34 provided non advanced cover. The proliferation of plans available on the market and the increasing segmentation of the market, due to strategies adopted by the commercial providers, is of growing concern to me. </p><p>  In this context, there are a number of options under consideration to help address the increasing number of plans on the market and the decreasing membership of the private health insurance market. One such measure is the possible introduction of a standard plan, supported by an effective Risk Equalisation Scheme and optional risk-rated additions. It is envisaged that a standard plan would provide an appropriate, defined level of health insurance cover, beyond which Risk Equalisation would not apply, and would be intended to provide greater clarity to consumers seeking to easily identify and purchase a health insurance product which provides a suitable level of cover. There is considerable work required to assess the impact of such a measure, including a thorough examination of the specific appropriate benefits and content that should appropriately be covered by a standard plan.

The Judge will work with key parties; including representatives of the women, the State Claims Agency and insurance companies in proposing a just outcome. Judge Murphy's work will take around eight weeks, at which time she will submit her independent report to me. I will then revert to Government with detailed proposals so that a decision can be taken as early as possible in the New Year. At that stage Prof Oonagh Walsh's Report will be published. </p><p>  The Terms of Reference for  the work of Judge Yvonne Murphy are:  </p><p>  1. To examine all relevant reports and information relating to symphysiotomy.</p><p>  2. To meet women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy procedures to assess what, in their opinion, would bring closure for them.</p><p>  3. To assess, in conjunction with the State Claims Agency (SCA) and other relevant bodies, the relative liabilities of insurers, indemnifiers and/or other parties in relation to cases pending, or which may arise linked to surgical symphysiotomy procedures.</p><p>  4. To meet insurers, indemnifiers and/or other parties  in relation to such liabilities and to explore and negotiate a quantum representing a fair contribution towards a fund which would form part of an ex-gratia scheme to which Government would also contribute in order to establish an ex-gratia scheme and put closure on the issue for the women involved.</p><p>  5. To assess the merits and cost to the State of proceeding with an ex-gratia scheme relative to allowing the court process to proceed.</p><p>  6. To report to the Minister within a period of 8 working weeks on the outcome of these deliberations, with recommendations on the next steps. </p><p>  I met representatives of the women yesterday with Judge Murphy to assure everyone that she will consult with all relevant parties in an environment where there are no preconceived ideas of what her conclusions might be.  In this way her work will be truly independent.</p><p>  My priority continues to be to ensure that the women who have had this procedure have their health needs comprehensively and professionally met. In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who may be experiencing any adverse effects as a result of undergoing this procedure. These services include the provision of medical cards for the women, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up. All these services are available on request by the women from the HSE nominated Symphysiotomy Liaison Officers.</p></reply>

However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so. </p><p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the necessary statutory provisions to fully implement the Directive.  Nevertheless, there are arrangements in place in respect of the key provision of the Directive in relation to a national contact point (NCP), which has been set up within the HSE &ndash; the email address is crossborderdirective@hse.ie.  </p><p>  The principle function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost, the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the rights, if any, that they may have through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP will be able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.  </p><p>  While it has been possible to have these aspects of the NCP up and running by the 25<sup>th</sup> October on an administrative basis, it has not been possible to have prior authorisation or reimbursement operating on a statutory basis.  The Department is working on the legal arrangements to put in place the statutory provisions for these systems and will be implementing them as soon as possible.</p><p>  Further information on the Ireland's implementation of the Directive is available on the NCP's webpage: </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.</p><p>  The Irish Government supported the original decision by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to approve the allocation of EU funding to the Narrow Water bridge project and committed an upfront funding contribution of &euro;3.9 million in January this year.  The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances.  This funding contribution was due to be matched with a contribution from the Northern Ireland authorities in line with the agreed funding ratios for the Programme.    </p><p>  The Government was disappointed that the tender process resulted in a doubling of the initial estimated cost budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge.  The Government has indicated on many occasions that it would be willing to help to address the shortfall in funding for the Narrow Water Bridge, but this depended entirely on matching contributions from the other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive.  Also, we could not agree to be solely responsible for any further overruns.   </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the recovery programme that this Government has had to pursue to put the country back on its feet, unfortunately, there will be a further reduction in regional and local roads spending in 2014 of over &euro;60 million.  Ultimately it is from this budget that any additional funding from this State would have had to come and we would not have been in a position to provide a further &euro;10 million towards this project as well as to underwrite any potential further overspend.  The estimated figure of a requirement from my Department of &euro;10 million was based on correspondence received from SEUPB and Louth County Council.  Given the significant difference between the initial estimates and the returned tender prices, the Deputy will appreciate the need to take a conservative approach to the funding requests.  </p><p>  The progression and importance of this project has been discussed with my government colleagues and on a number of occasions at the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) most recently on the 8th of November.  The priority is to avoid the loss of the EU funding involved. As the Deputy will be aware, members of the party that he leads are members of the  Northern Ireland Executive and of the NSMC. </p><p>  It is important to note that there are time constraints with regard to the INTERREG funding.  It has to be spent by 2015. SEUPB has now decided to withdraw the letter of offer and has indicated that it proposes to re-allocate the funding to eligible projects capable of being delivered before the end of 2015.  I know that officials in my Department and the Department for Regional Development have identified possible replacement projects, that will benefit cross-border communication in the transport sector and will be working up proposals for consideration by SEUPB.</p></reply>
