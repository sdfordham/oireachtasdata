A monthly breakdown of rent supplement recipients from January 2015 to April 2016 is provided in the attached tabular statement. </p><p>The number of rent supplement recipients has reduced during this period which can be attributed to a number of factors including the improving economy and the change in rent supplement policy following the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities. Where HAP is in operation this Department will continue to provide rental support, under the rent supplement scheme, to those with a short term need, generally because of a temporary loss of employment. HAP is now operational in 19 local authority areas and officials continue to work with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities to support its further roll out.</p><p><b>Rent Supplement Recipients &ndash; January 2015 to date</b><table><tr><th>Month</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>January </td><td>70,761</td><td>60,073</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>70,183</td><td>59,006</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>69,793</td><td>57,605</td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>68,673</td><td>56,811</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>67,887</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>67,016</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>65,997</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>65,042</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>63,826</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>62,876</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>62,009</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>61,247</td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-05a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016050500039#WRA01900"><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle both youth and long-term unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. </p><p>Reflecting the impact of Government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 19% in March 2016 (as estimated by CSO, compared to 21.5% in March 2015 and with a peak of over 31% in 2012).  The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.7% in Q4 2015.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 57.8% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012. </p><p>Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate the young unemployed and long-term unemployed back into work.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014). </p><p>As under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main approach in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU Council recommendation. </p><p>The key objective is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement with young people by case officers to assist young people to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  As part of this process additional supports may be provided, both through existing schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015. </p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and additionally commits to: increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p><p>A range of measures were introduced under previous <i>Pathways to Work </i>strategies for the long-term unemployed.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for the long-term unemployed on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes.<i></i>A core focus of <i>Pathways to Work </i>2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-05a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016050500039#WRA02100"><p>The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.  It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  The official measure of unemployment is sourced from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS).  Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  </p><p>My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level.  This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories.  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments. </p><p>The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan and the <i>Pathways to Work </i>strategies, key policy documents to facilitate the young unemployed and the long-term unemployed, respectively, back into work, are underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above. </p><p>By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the Government&rsquo;s policy tends to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The scheme was designed with a view to ensuring that some people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited.  The rate of payment depends upon which band a yearly average falls into.  Those with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions may receive a 100% pension, whereas, for example, those with a yearly average of 20 contributions are in a lower band, and receive a pension at 85% of the maximum rate (plus allowances where applicable).</p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced, with six bands replacing the four which were in place up to then.  These new bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that, generally, those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. </p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  There are no proposals to backdate the scheme to cover periods of homemaking prior to 1994, due to the very significant costs which would be involved. </p>  <p>  Work has commenced to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; where the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legislative, administrative, and technical aspects to be addressed in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  The changes will be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those workers affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund (2012) confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 38% of the maximum may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p></reply>

This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.  MABS has offices throughout the State.I would strongly suggest that anyone with debt or budgeting difficulties should approach their local MABS Office with a view to securing a confidential consultation with a money adviser to consider their particular circumstances and to seek advice if they wish to procure credit from a reputable lender or credit provider.  </p><p>A Personal Micro Credit Scheme has been developed under the auspices of the Citizens Information Board and the Social Finance Foundation, supported by the Department of Social Protection, and is currently being piloted in a number of Credit Unions.  The scheme involves offering people receiving social welfare payments small affordable loans from credit unions as an alternative to moneylenders.  A Personal Microcredit Implementation Group under the Department of Social Protection is progressing this initiative and 30 credit unions from around the country are participating.  The Department of Finance is represented on this group.  Loans range from &euro;100 - &euro;2,000 in value and are repayable over 6-24 months with loan repayments deducted automatically from the household budget scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with An Post.  The interest rate is a maximum of 12% a year.  The pilot is expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.  I understand that a draft evaluation report on this scheme is currently being prepared by the Department of Social Protection and is nearing completion.  </p><p>In addition, the Central Bank has informed me that consumers of licensed moneylenders are protected by a range of provisions that moneylenders must adhere to including, but not limited to, the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders, the European Communities Consumer Credit Agreements Regulations 2010 and the Consumer Credit Act, 1995. </p><p>Currently, there are 40 moneylenders licensed to operate in the Republic of Ireland.  Since the Central Bank assumed responsibility for the licensed moneylending sector in 2003, the number of licensed moneylenders has decreased and the Central Bank has not permitted an increase to the maximum APR.  Details of the APRs and costs of credit permitted for each moneylender are disclosed on the Central Bank's public , which is available on its website.  Furthermore, in November 2013, the Central Bank published a .</p><p>The Central Bank has confirmed that it has not licensed any moneylender to provide a 'pay-day loan' service such as exists in the UK (and were the subject of a recent price cap by the Financial Conduct Authority - FCA). The maximum costs of credit of Irish licensed moneylenders are significantly below the FCA cap, both in terms of total cost and on a daily interest rate basis (for those loans that would be comparable to the FCA's &quot;included&quot; loans). </p><p>Nonetheless, any consumer who has concerns in relation to how they have been treated by a licensed moneylender is encouraged to make a complaint to the licensed moneylender and, if not satisfied with the firm's response, to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Financial Services Ombudsman investigates, in an impartial and independent manner, complaints from individual customers and small businesses who have unresolved disputes with financial service providers which are regulated by the Central Bank.  Investigations by the Financial Services Ombudsman are free of charge to the customer.  In addition, licensed moneylenders must treat complaints received from consumers in compliance with the provisions of the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders.</p></reply>

The most recent Central Bank Quarterly Bulletin reports on this </p><p><i>(</i><i>)</i>.  It notes that Household debt at end September 2015 stood at its lowest level in almost ten years and that overall household debt has fallen by 26 per cent since its peak in the third quarter of 2008.  The  Bulletin also notes that debt sustainability also continued to improve in 2015.  Debt as a proportion of total assets has been declining since the second quarter of 2012 and stood at 19.4 per cent at end-September 2015.  Furthermore, over the past year, Irish households have reduced debt as a proportion of disposable income by 24 percentage points, to 160 per cent.  The decline in these indicators reflects falling debt levels, as well as the increase in household total assets and disposable income.  Meanwhile, the cost of servicing outstanding household debt remained broadly stable throughout 2015, as the interest rate on total outstanding loans to households averaged 3.33 per cent over the year.  The equivalent rate for the euro area as a whole was 3.54 per cent over the same period.  Household net worth, calculated as the sum of housing and financial assets minus liabilities, rose to &euro;618 billion, or &euro;133,225 <i>per capita</i>at end-September 2015. </p><p>In the case of Non-Financial Corporations (NFCs) the bulletin notes that NFC debt as a percentage of GDP continued to decline in the third quarter of 2015 (184 per cent).  It also notes that  when analysing Irish NFC debt trends, it is important to note that Ireland has substantial multinational corporation (MNC) activities, which have little interaction with the domestic financial system.  Though NFC debt as a percentage of GDP is currently at its  lowest level since Q2 2009, it remains high in an international context.  Ireland ranks third highest among European countries in terms of NFC debt to GDP, behind Luxembourg (328 per cent) and Cyprus (231 per cent), both countries that also have relatively large MNC sectors.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, the overall level is high and this is explicitly recognised in the risk table of the recently published Stability Programme Update </p><p><i>(</i><i>)</i>.  </p><p>As regards SME legacy debt, Chapter 7 (Finance for Growth) of this year's Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) sets out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.  In line with Action 144 of the APJ, officials from my Department continue to collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to SME legacy debt.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.  In addition, I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that, as part of their on-going supervision, the Central Bank, working in conjunction with the European Cental Bank (ECB) as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), continues to challenge the banks on their strategies, management, measurement and reporting of the resolution and restructuring of all non-performing loans (NPLs) including SME NPLs.  Relevant actions taken by the Central Bank in recent years have been extensive and include, <i>inter alia</i>, capital assessment reviews, stress tests, distressed credit operation reviews, balance sheet assessment exercises, SME loan resolution bank specific targets, on-site inspections and ongoing, intensive supervisory engagement with the banks regarding distressed debt.  In 2013 non-public institution specific SME distressed loan resolution targets were set for a number of banks.  The targets required the banks to develop strategies, at borrower level, to resolve their non-performing loans.  The targets ended in Q1 2015 with lenders reporting that they satisfied the requirements set out.  Progress has been made by the relevant institutions in resolving SME NPLs in recent years and NPL trends continue to move in a positive trajectory.  Bank of Ireland has indicated that it has reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases and more than 9 out of 10 restructured business banking borrowers continue to meet their agreed arrangements.  AIB has also made significant progress in reducing distressed loan balances with the process of restructuring the group's SME book reaching its latter stages with the majority of offered SME restructures either complete or at the final stages of completion.  Recognising these developments, alongside changes in the supervision of the banks following the introduction of the SSM, the Central Bank's approach to commercial NPL resolution utilises a bank specific approach taking into consideration a number of factors including, <i>inter alia</i>, the institution's NPL resolution strategy and operational capability.  The sustainable resolution of distressed SME loans remains a significant priority for the Central Bank and will therefore continue to be central to their supervisory focus throughout 2016 and beyond.  Supervision will continue to be intrusive, supplemented by targeted inspections and enhanced monitoring of performance of the banks in delivery of supervisory objectives.</p></reply>

A Steering Group which comprises representatives of KCC, the OPW and the consultants was set up to advance the project.</p>  <p>  KCC and its consultants submitted a Draft Options Report/Feasibility Study to the OPW in 2014.  Following consideration of the draft report by the OPW, it was agreed by the Steering Group that the consultants would carry out a review of the proposed scheme.  The review would investigate if additional or alternative and more cost effective measures could be put in place to alleviate flooding in the area.  Any changes identified by the review process would need to be incorporated into the CBA and EIS before the scheme can be advanced.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the consultants have completed the review process and KCC has submitted its findings to the OPW.  It is expected that the Steering Group will be meeting shortly with the aim of finalising the Feasibility Report.  Once the Feasibility Report has been finalised, and provided the scheme is still economically and environmentally viable, KCC and the OPW will decide on how best to advance the proposed works.  I can confirm that the Lower Morrell scheme remains a priority and the OPW has included provision for the cost of the proposed works in its financial profiles in the period up to 2018.</p></reply>

There are a total of 70 properties/sites in the Howth Fishery Harbour Centre property portfolio, the majority of which are occupied by a variety of public and commercial bodies which support the Fishery Harbour Centre&rsquo;s role as a working fishery harbour in addition to a broad range of other activities.  In 2015 my Department collected a total of &euro;561,794 in respect of income from these properties including rent and licence fees.  When I last responded to the Deputy on this matter on October 1st 2015 the rental arrears stood at &euro;603,395; at 31st December 2015 these arrears stood at &euro;538,451.  The majority of these arrears relate to legacy issues which my Department is actively addressing in conjunction with its legal advisers and the individual tenants concerned.   </p>  <p>  Since taking over responsibility for the management and operation of the Fishery Harbour Centres my Department has established a dedicated Property Unit to manage the property portfolio.  In addition, my Department worked closely with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office to increase the legal capacity resource for progressing the often complex and protracted legal aspects relating to outstanding property cases.  An additional solicitor was employed by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office at my Department&rsquo;s request to deal exclusively with Fishery Harbour Centre property portfolio, the cost of which is being met from the Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour Centre Fund. </p>  <p>  In addition, a dedicated Debt Recovery Unit was established in October 2009 to address the debt that had developed in the harbours predating my Department.  In 2013, my Department's Management Advisory Committee set up a Debtor Review Group comprising representatives from Accounts, Finance and Legal Services Divisions to assist and give direction to debtor divisions in the area of debt management.  A Central Debt Management Group has also been formed to monitor compliance and debt levels.   </p></reply>

From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland&rsquo;s overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.  This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment.</p>  <p>  A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield).  This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  The introduction of a landing obligation/discarding ban on a phased basis, as set out in the CFP, also represents a fundamental shift in fisheries policy and fishing practices.  It is expected that over time the landing obligation will lead to an improvement in the state of the stocks of importance to Ireland and will result in increased fishing opportunities for the Irish fishing industry.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to launch on 14 January 2016 Ireland&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme.  This new investment programme will be the source of very significant investment supports for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020.  The Programme represents a doubling of previous support levels.</p>  <p>  The Programme aims to support the seafood industry in meeting the challenges of the CFP and in sustainably growing production, value and employment in the seafood industry, in particular the aquaculture and processing sectors.  Some &euro;67 million is being made available for the fishing sector, &euro;30 million for aquaculture and &euro;30 million for seafood processing and marketing.  A further &euro;12 million is being made available to significantly grow the Fisheries Local Action Group initiative to foster economic activity in fishing communities and &euro;10 million for blue growth and marine spatial planning.</p>  <p>  The Programme will support the FoodWise 2025 strategy for the seafood sector, in particular its targets of achieving &euro;1 billion in seafood sales and growth of employment of 3,000 by 2020.</p>  <p>  A range of schemes under the Programme have already been launched by BIM in 2016 and grant offers are being made at present.  I have provided BIM with some &euro;23.7 million in 2016 for this purpose.</p></reply>

The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services, the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force and available resources. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels as set out above in accordance with available training capacity. This approach is underlined by the recently announced General Service recruitment campaign, which was launched on 13 April 2016 with a closing date of 22 May 2016. This provides a window of five weeks for an individual to register their interest and apply. I am satisfied that the time period allocated is sufficient and I have no plans to extend it. The processing of applications through the system takes a significant amount of time involving psychometric tests, fitness tests, interview, medical examinations, security clearance etc. We need to move ahead with that process expeditiously in order to have a panel in place from which we can draw recruits later this year. </p>  <p>  The upper age limit for enlistment in the Army and Air Corps is under 25 years of age on the closing date for receipt of applications for enlistment, and for the Naval Service it is under 27 years of age on the closing date for receipt of applications for enlistment. These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force requires that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation as a whole. The Defence Forces have an ongoing objective of ensuring an appropriate age profile through continuous recruitment and congruent manpower planning, training and development and career management strategies. Given the health and fitness requirements for Privates and new recruits to the Defence Forces, I do not believe that it would serve the Defence Forces or the individual recruits well to increase the current age limits.</p></reply>

To date some 90 of the recommendations have been fully implemented and a further 26 are in the process of being implemented.  Work on implementing a further number of recommendations is continuing.  The International Protection Act 2015 responds to 26 of the Report's recommendations.  The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing. </p>  <p>  At the end of April there were some 4,400 persons living in the direct provision system.  This is a reduction from the figure of approximately 5,100 at the end of 2014 notwithstanding that there was a doubling of the numbers of persons seeking asylum last year compared with 2014.  This reflects the significant progress made in processing cases on hand over this period.</p>  <p>  My officials met with a representative group of NGOs yesterday to update them on progress.</p></reply>

This scheme is being co-ordinated by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection, and with the involvement of agencies including the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Citizens Information Board. </p><p>I can advise the Deputy that under the scheme as envisaged, there are three main legal aid components:  </p><p>1. A Solicitor Consultation Service;</p><p>2. A Duty Solicitor Service; and</p><p>3. A Personal Insolvency Arrangement Review (PIA Review) - Legal Aid Service.</p><p>The solicitor consultation service is to provide a single legal advice consultation to an eligible person.  In certain circumstances and upon prior approval by the Board, the service may extend to conducting negotiations for the settlement of repossession proceedings and a second consultation in those circumstances.  The Consultation Service shall include but not be limited to:</p><p>- arranging a consultation with the client and taking instructions</p><p>- checking the borrower's legal position,</p><p>- explaining clearly the position to the borrower and answering their questions,</p><p>- advising the borrower on any related legal complications (for example where a co-borrower is not co-operating in efforts to resolve the mortgage arrears) or where needed, on legal aspects of alternative solutions,</p><p>- informing the person who does not have a legal defence to repossession, but who might benefit from accompaniment to Court, of the existence of the duty solicitor service,</p><p>- advising and facilitating the person to make an application for civil legal aid to defend the proceedings (outside the scope of this scheme) if they have a good defence capable of meeting the merits criteria under section 24 and 28 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.</p><p>The principle of the duty solicitor service is that a solicitor is in attendance at the court to provide assistance generally, to persons who have been served with proceedings for re-possession of their home and who do not have legal representation.  The duty solicitor is paid for their time rather than by case. Persons who have been served with a Civil Bill for Repossession of their home which is listed for hearing before the County Registrar and who have been given a legal advice voucher, may avail of the Duty Solicitor Service.</p><p>The PIA Review Legal Aid Service relates to applications to the Circuit Court or High Court where a debtor has sought to come to an arrangement with his or her creditors with the assistance of a Personal Insolvency Practitioner but the creditors or one of them has not approved the arrangement, the debtor wishes to seek the court's overruling of the creditors objections, and the Personal Insolvency Practitioner believes there are good grounds for doing so.</p><p>The development of this scheme is at an advanced stage and I expect that it will be introduced in the near future.</p></reply>

Tusla's policy is that all children coming into care and those in high risk placements have an allocated social worker.  Subsequent gaps may be attributed to a number of factors including maternity leave, vacancies and competing priorities. </p><p>Where a child is awaiting the allocation of a social worker, this is responded to by a social work duty team on a risk management basis.  During this time, work with the child and their family may be undertaken by the social work team leader or social workers in the duty system.  Some of these children may have had an allocated social worker, but due to a social worker leaving, they are reclassified as awaiting a social worker.  The increased budget for Tusla for 2016 should result in higher levels of children in care having an allocated social worker.</p><p>The data provided is not disaggregated at county level, but is provided grouped in 17 administrative areas.

In other areas, Tusla Adoption services provide information on the availability of local services, access to the social work duty system and facilitate peer support groups for parents of adopted children.</p>  <p>  However it should be noted that under the Adoption Act 2010, when a child is the subject of a domestic or intercountry adoption, that child is considered the child of the adopter/s.  The Adoption Act 2010 also provides that children adopted from abroad should be registered with the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly, it is open to any adopted child to access the full range of services which are currently available to all Irish children.  These include specialist psychiatric and psychological services, health services and speech and language services. </p>  <p>  While I appreciate that some children adopted from abroad may require specialised services for complex needs, such need would be consistent for all children with complex needs, not just those adopted.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll-out of the new inclusive preschools model. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional pre-school supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

The drug was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by the European Medicines Agency in November 2015. To date, it has not been approved for reimbursement by any public health service in Europe.</p>  <p>  Each country has its own process for approval. The Irish process is laid down in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The Act gives the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the community drugs schemes.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence-based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.</p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available to the HSE.  The process for approval of new high tech drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a rapid review, which has been completed for Orkambi.  The second involves a full health technology assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and evaluates whether the claims made for the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, including its impact, for example, on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions or reduced need for transplants.  The NCPE also considers which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price sought by the manufacturer.  I have requested that the NCPE expedite this part of the process.  The Centre hopes to be in a position to issue its recommendation to the HSE in early June, and the HSE may, if it decides to proceed, then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer.</p>  <p>  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE for investment in new treatments for Irish patients, and any savings that accrue from the process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.</p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who may benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.</p></reply>

The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations. Each of these are contributors to the cost of care, the cost of claims and therefore the cost of premia payable. </p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister, keeping the health insurance market stable and increasing the numbers taking out health insurance has been one of my key priorities. An increase in the numbers taking out health insurance helps to control premium inflation, thereby keeping health insurance more affordable for everyone. Lifetime Community Rating Regulations came into effect from 1 May 2015 and late entry loadings now apply for people aged 35 and over when taking out health insurance for the first time. This encourages people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby avoiding loadings and helping to spread the health costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons. In addition, 'Young Adult&rsquo; rates of premium, which are based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to age 26, also apply from May 2015. These discounts encourage younger members to remain in the insured market. Without these measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and result in higher insurance premiums.</p>  <p>  The impact of these initiatives on the market can now be seen, as the number of people now holding private health insurance is 2.126 million, or 45.9% of the Irish population (end-March 2016). This represents an increase of over 95,000 members on the previous 12 months, which contributes positively to keeping health insurance affordable for those who wish to avail of it.</p></reply>

Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE.</p><p>Waiting list figures at the end of the last three years are as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. of Patients awaiting orthodontic treatment </th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>15,830</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>17,601</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>15,540</td></tr></table>Comparable figures for 2012 and 2011 are not available as not all HSE areas reported in these years. </p><p>Following a national procurement process, a panel of independent practitioners is currently being contracted by the HSE to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment. The practitioners will be under contract over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years. This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer who are generally 16 years and over.  It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times. </p><p>In addition, a pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area (DNE), which involves up-skilling staff to work as orthodontic therapists is currently underway.  A dental hygienist and a dental nurse qualified as orthodontic therapists in September 2015 and are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists. The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists. Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive. It is planned to extend the scheme after the evaluation has been completed.</p></reply>

Funding was allocated in 2015 for additional consultant posts including two consultant orthopaedic surgeons, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further.  The 2016 Service Plan specifically provides for support for the new theatre capacity and the continued development of paediatric scoliosis services to address ongoing capacity deficits. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting times in the interim, patients from Crumlin have been transferred to other hospitals where capacity is available and where that is clinically appropriate.  These include Temple Street, Cappagh, Tallaght and the Blackrock Clinic.  External capacity has also been identified at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore in the UK.  The Department of Health is continuing to work with the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the hospitals themselves to ensure that we continue to make strong progress in addressing this issue and to identify all options to further improve access times. </p>  <p>  As the specific issues raised are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Additional Temporary Clerical Officers will be recruited shortly for a total of 780 weeks to manage the significant increase in phone calls and customer queries over the remaining peak period.  In view of the sustained increase in applications over last year processing work has been redistributed across passport offices in recent months and staff re-deployed from other areas of the Department as needed to respond to the increased workload.</p>  <p>  I strongly recommend that citizens apply for passports at least six weeks in advance of any planned travel and take special care to ensure that application forms are correctly completed.  Submission of applications in good time is particularly important during the peak season which runs from now until August.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service will continue to closely monitor the situation, including to ensure the effective deployment of staff resources. </p></reply>

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.</p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.  It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants.  An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p></reply>

This group - the Finance Work Stream - comprises a range of key stakeholders including my Department, the Housing Finance Agency, the National Development Finance Agency and the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The objective of this work is to try to deliver an investment  mechanism for social housing that does not negatively impact on the General Government Balance. </p><p>Arising from the opportunity offered by the Strategy, a range of developers, investors, financiers and others expressed interest in being involved in the provision of or investment in social housing. A protocol was put in place in March 2015 under the auspices of the Finance Work Stream to facilitate individuals and entities seeking to engage with the State to provide investment for the delivery of social housing.</p><p>During the course of its work, the Clearing House Group received 25 proposals for funding social and affordable housing, using both existing mechanisms and new approaches. The Group reported in November 2015, and arising from its work a number of measures are being developed with a view to better facilitating private investment into social housing.These include: </p><p>- amendments to existing arrangements under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programmeto facilitate investment by institutional investors; and</p><p>- an affordable rental scheme.</p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme currently provides a means whereby properties can be built or bought by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) with the use of private funding and leased through AHB&rsquo;s and Local Authorities, for the provision of social housing. This scheme is underpinned by a lease and other legal agreements which provide that rental payments are made by the State over an agreed long-term time period, typically 20 years, in return for which the housing unit is made available for social housing. Changes are now being proposed to this scheme to provide revised arrangements which serve to expand these mechanisms to facilitate larger institutional private investors to come into the social housing market.</p><p>On 2 February 2016, Government approved the over-arching principles which will underpin these revised arrangements and the arrangements being developed to give effect to an affordable rental scheme.</p><p>The Affordable Rental pilot scheme was announced as part of Budget 2016 which will utilise some of the &euro;400m being made available from the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann . The scheme is currently being developed in my Department.  &euro;10m has been made available for the scheme in 2016. This is to be an on-going annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of housing for affordable rental.</p></reply>

In total the programme is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units. PPP units take a minimum of 3 years to be delivered. To enable delivery to commence as quickly as possible, the PPP programme is being rolled-out in three bundles. </p>  <p>  The first bundle of PPP sites which is to provide over 500 units in the greater Dublin area was announced in October 2015.  The social housing is being developed at these six sites in co-operation with the local authorities in each area. Two of the sites are located in Dublin City with one each in South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth.      </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council has been appointed to act as the lead local authority for the delivery of the social housing PPP Programme in respect of this first bundle.  The delivery and governance arrangements for this bundle have now been put in place and the Project Board held its first meeting on 29 April 2016.  The Project Board is chaired by the Chief Executive of the City Council and includes representatives of my Department, the National Development Finance Agency and each of the Local Authorities concerned (in this case, Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council, Louth County Council, Wicklow County Council and Kildare County Council).     </p>  <p>  Site selection for the second bundle is close to finalisation with a third bundle to be finalised by end of 2016.   The identification of sites is being overseen by a sub-group of the Finance Work Stream - a structure which operates as part of the implementation arrangement for the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  This sub-group includes representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the National Development Finance Agency and the Housing Agency.   </p>  <p>  The units to be delivered under the programme will use what is termed an &lsquo;availability-based&rsquo; PPP model, in which a private sector company designs, builds, finances and maintains the social housing units in return for a &lsquo;unitary payment&rsquo;.   The &lsquo;availability based&rsquo; model being applied has been used successfully in Ireland for over 15 years to deliver roads, schools and courthouses.  It involves the procurement of a consortium to design, build, finance and maintain, for 25 years, social housing units on sites provided by the State. The housing units are then handed over to the State after 25 years in a predefined, good quality condition. No expenditure has been incurred to date in respect of the PPP project.   </p>  <p>  The relevant local authorities will retain responsibility for tenant management during the contract period. Tenants allocated to PPP units are drawn, in the normal manner, from the local authority social housing waiting list in accordance with that local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  The tenants are subject to standard arrangements as apply to other social housing allocations, including in respect of the charging of differential rent.   </p></reply>

There have been nine meetings of the Oversight Group since the publication of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>in November 2014.</p><p>Membership of the Oversight Group is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Minister Alan Kelly T.D. </th><th>Co-Chair </th><th>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government <br /><br /></th></tr><tr><td>Minister of State Paudie Coffey</td><td>Co-Chair </td><td>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with Special Responsibility for Housing, Planning and Coordination of the Construction 2020 Strategy </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. John McCarthy </td><td>Secretary General </td><td>Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa </td><td>Assistant Secretary/Chair of the Social Housing Strategy Project Board </td><td>Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government </td></tr><tr><td>Ms Helen Faughnan </td><td>Assistant Secretary <br /><br /></td><td>Department of Social Protection </td></tr><tr><td>Ms Patricia Coleman </td><td>Assistant Secretary <br /><br /></td><td>Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. John McCarthy </td><td>Chief Economist </td><td>Department of Finance <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Padraig &Oacute; Conaill </td><td>Principal Officer </td><td>Department of Social Protection </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Danie l McLoughlin </td><td>Chief Executive/Chair of the Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce <br /><br /></td><td>South Dublin County Council </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Pat Gallagher </td><td>Chief Executive/Chair of County &amp;amp; City Management Association <br /><br /></td><td>Westmeath County Council </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Eugene Cummins </td><td>Chief Executive/Chair of County &amp;amp; City Management Association, Housing Committee <br /><br /></td><td>Roscommon County Council </td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Donal McManus </td><td>Chief Executive Officer <br /><br /></td><td>Irish Council for Social Housing </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Kieron Brennan </td><td>Chief Executive Officer <br /><br /></td><td>Co-operative Housing Ireland </td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Rory O'Donnell </td><td>Director <br /><br /></td><td>National Economic &amp;amp; Social Council </td></tr></table>Given the scale of the challenge in the Dublin area, a key early action of the Strategy was the establishment of a Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce (DSHDT), to oversee and drive the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation across the four Dublin local authorities.</p><p>Full details regarding the Taskforce&rsquo;s role and its terms of reference are set out at paragraph 4.3 of the Strategy.

This work forms one of the key blocks of Pillar 2 of the Strategy, exploring ways of enhancing the capacity of the rental sector to contribute to the provision of affordable housing support in a sustainable manner, supporting the continued growth in the rental sector, avoiding an over reliance on any one particular tenure and reflecting wider labour market patterns and the need for an increasingly mobile work-force. The particular focus of this work is on the potential of cost/affordable rental models to provide secure, affordable accommodation in the rented sector.</p><p>In that context, an Affordable Rental pilot scheme was announced in October 2015, as part of Budget 2016.  The scheme is currently being developed in my Department.  &euro;10m has been made available for the scheme in 2016, the first step in what is to be an on-going annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of housing for affordable rental.  On 2 February 2016, Government approved the over-arching principles which will underpin the arrangements being developed to give effect to an affordable rental scheme.  Work on the developing the detailed terms of the scheme is ongoing.</p><p>The scheme is expected to work on the basis of qualifying tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall.  A State intervention - such as a subsidy - would be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford, and what the housing market charges. Such a scheme would also facilitate and incentivise private investment into this sector.</p></reply>

As a means of expediting the provision of social housing NAMA established a special purpose vehicle &ndash; National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd (NARPS). The purpose of this SPV is to acquire properties from developers or receivers in NAMA&rsquo;s portfolio of loans and to make these available to local authorities and AHBs by way of a long term lease. In this way, a number of legal complexities around the securing of properties can be addressed and the process can move more quickly.  A Steering Group was established comprising representatives of NAMA, the Housing Agency and my Department in order to work systematically through the units identified by NAMA, and to determine if there is a social housing demand for the properties. The Steering Group generally meets fortnightly and there have been approximately 100 meetings since 2012. Within this context, significant progress has been made in respect of delivery.</p><p>At the end of March 2016, a total of 2,042 residential properties have been delivered for social housing providers comprising of 1,469 completed properties with a further 573 that have been contracted where completion work is on-going. Of these 1,066 were contracted/delivered through the mechanism of NARPS. Full information including a breakdown by Local Authority is available on the website of the Housing Agency at /NAMA and also on the NAMA website .</p><p>Local Authorities, particularly those in high demand areas, are continually reviewing the list of available NAMA properties to see if they are suitable to be brought into use as social housing for people on local authority housing lists.  The allocation and tenanting of social housing units is a matter for the relevant local authority, and my Department does not hold any records in this regard.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The provision of electronic communications infrastructure, including the significant investment required to make high speed telecommunication services publicly available, occurs within a fully liberalised market. It is a matter for the competing network providers to decide those areas which can be served on a commercial basis, in the first instance. Intervention by the State is limited to investment or co-investment in those areas of the country the commercial market will not serve. </p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services in the last four years, and is continuing to invest. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available. </p><p>On 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment. The formal procurement process commenced with the publication of the Pre-qualification Questionnaire and Project Information Memorandum. Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March. The responses are now being assessed in line with criteria set down by the Department with a view to selecting qualified provider(s) to proceed to the next stage of the procurement. This second stage in the process will be formal Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders. </p><p>This is scheduled to commence in June and will take place over the Summer. The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders shortlisted and the complexities that may be encountered during the dialogue process.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area. </p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that all of the 1.6m premises, where commercial operators have committed to providing services will have access to High Speed Broadband of at least 30 Mbps.</p><p>The areas marked AMBER, including the area from Mullingar to Ballynacargy in County Westmeath, represent the target areas for the State Intervention. Members of the public can view whether their premises are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode. </p><p>The Intervention Strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps download and 6 Mbps upload. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand. </p><p>The intention is to build out the network in the AMBER area as quickly as possible. The Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) on the optimum rollout strategy, and on the sequencing of the network deployment to maximise efficiencies during network build, having regard to business and consumer needs, and to areas of particularly poor service and areas of strong demand. All these factors will need to be balanced against the most efficient network roll out and will be agreed during the procurement process.</p><p>Engagement with industry stakeholders as part of the pre-procurement consultations has indicated that the network in the Amber area could be achieved within 3-5 years, after contract(s) is awarded.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of Ireland's electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body. I have no statutory function in the setting or review of electricity or gas prices. It is Government policy to encourage competition in the electricity and gas markets.</p>  <p>  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market. There is no price control in the oil sector. I have no statutory function in the setting or review of oil, petrol or diesel prices.</p>  <p>  In Statutory Instrument 630 of 2011 the CER was assigned, inter alia, market monitoring functions in relation to the supply of electricity and gas. These functions included monitoring the development of competition in the supply of electricity and gas to final customers and taking action to ensure that final customers are benefitting from competition.  In this regard, CER publishes quarterly market monitoring reports. </p>  <p>  The Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 provides for CER&rsquo;s regulatory independence and its accountability to a Committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. I note that at its most recent appearance in front of the Oireachtas Committee when prices formed part of the agenda, CER representatives described for members the relationship between wholesale and retail prices at that time and their view that retail competition is working in Ireland as evidenced by switching rates.</p>  <p>  The CER also briefs me periodically on broad electricity and gas market developments including on its market monitoring reports.

However, it is important to note that the electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive and that they operate within national and European regulatory regimes.  I have no statutory function in the setting or review of electricity or gas prices.    </p>  <p>  Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  The CER ceased regulating retail electricity prices in 2011 and retail gas prices in 2014. </p>  <p>  The competitive energy market results in choice for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices, exerting downward pressure on prices.  Under various relevant Statutory Instruments, CER carries out statutory market monitoring functions and has the responsibility to ensure the market operates competitively for the benefit of the consumer.  The statutory functions include monitoring whether the development and operation of competition in electricity supply is benefitting final customers.  CER market monitoring reports are available on its website.  In this regard I am confident that the regulator is carrying out its functions effectively and that it will continue to ensure that competitive markets are delivering for all consumers as I set out in the Energy White Paper published in December last.</p>  <p>  The latest Eurostat average electricity and gas price statistics as published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) relate to the first half of 2015.  The report shows that the vast majority of residential consumption bands in both electricity and gas experienced reductions in average prices in the first half of 2015.  Focusing on the consumption bands with the largest share of the market, Eurostat figures show that average prices for Irish residential gas consumers were 5% lower than the Euro Area average, while average prices for business gas consumers were 3% lower than the Euro Area average.  Average prices for residential electricity consumers were 4% below the Euro Area average, while average prices for business electricity consumers were 6% above the Euro Area average. </p>  <p>   In recent public communications the CER indicated that if the current international trend in wholesale electricity and gas prices continued, there would be scope for price reductions for consumers in 2016.  The announcement last week of further price reductions by Electric Ireland, following announcements by a number of suppliers in 2015, indicates that competition is working for the benefit of customers.  While I have no statutory role in the setting or review of energy prices I welcome these reductions by energy suppliers in domestic gas and electricity prices.</p></reply>

Given the wider benefits of Eurocontrol membership, the long-standing and well-established nature of these arrangements, together with the reciprocity provided to Ireland by other participating States, the suspension or ending of the current exemption arrangements was not considered justified in the period referred to by the Deputy.  There are no plans at present to alter the current policy.</p></reply>

Having assessed existing commitments and the funding available (including funding that will become available from withdrawn projects) it is considered prudent to progress one additional new pool project.  Following consideration of the expressions of interest, and the two valid proposals for new pools, I have included a proposal from South Dublin County Council (SDCC) for a new swimming pool in Lucan in the LASPP.</p></reply>

CSO figures show, that trips to Ireland in 2015 were up by 13.7% compared to 2014 with a total of 8.643 million overseas visits to Ireland.  There was also very strong growth in revenue from overseas visitors in 2015.  Earnings from overseas visits, excluding fares, were &euro;4.2 billion.  This represented an increase of 18.6% on the previous year.  The strong performance has been continued into 2016.  The most recent statistics published by the CSO for the first quarter of 2016 show that the number of trips to Ireland for the first quarter of 2016 was up 16.6 % compared to the same period in 2015, with 1.785 million overseas visits to Ireland.  Therefore, tourism is playing a significant role in Ireland's economic recovery and has directly contributed to the maintenance and creation of new jobs.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to contribute to the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and we will ensure that we deliver on our commitments within it.  In developing the Action Plan, the Government is taking not just a short term view of job creation but is also laying the foundation for structures that facilitate and support longer term sustainable job creation opportunities.  My Department is doing likewise.</p></reply>
