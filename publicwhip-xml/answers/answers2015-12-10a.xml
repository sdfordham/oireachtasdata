    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-10a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121000056#WRA00500"><p>I do not propose to revise the targets for social housing delivery announced last April and issued at that time to all local authorities to cover the period out to end-2017.  Those targets are in line with the Social Housing Strategy and have been carefully calibrated to make a substantial impact on the housing waiting lists of all local authority areas across the country.  The delivery of social housing through different approaches requires different lead-in times.  In particular, construction projects need time for planning, approval by elected members, tendering and construction.  This is why I have targeted a range of approaches to delivery which include local authorities and approved housing bodies acquiring properties where good value for money is achievable, the remediation of vacant social houses, securing long term leased units using the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), additional provision under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), as well as the roll-out of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).     </p>  <p>A strong pipeline of new social housing construction projects is now in place following from the announcement in May of the first major direct build social housing programme under the Social Housing Strategy  , involving some 100 separate housing projects, and a further substantial announcement in July of approvals for local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The outcome has been half a billion euro allocated for 2,900 social housing new builds and acquisitions up to the end 2017. Further announcements in this regard are planned for the New Year. </p>  <p>While the availability of suitable properties in the private market is currently challenging, the RAS and SHCEP combined have met the social housing needs of an additional 2,547 households to date in 2015. Over the lifetime of the Strategy, the two schemes are expected to provide accommodation for 29,400 households, and I remain confident that this can be achieved. In addition the roll out of the HAP scheme will continue, with a further 10,000 households to be accommodated under the scheme in 2016 alone.   </p>  <p>I am committed to facilitating local authorities to return the maximum possible number of vacant social housing units to productive use in 2015. In addition to the original funding provided for this purpose in 2015, and conscious of the impact of the pressures in the private rental market on delivery under the RAS and SHCEP schemes, I have increased the budget allocation in order deliver an estimated 2,500 vacant units back into productive use this year.   </p>  <p>Overall, I am satisfied that between new builds, acquisitions and the return of vacant units, we are on track to deliver the capital target of almost 7,500 units by 2017.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the first recommendation of the CEDRA report relates to the preparation of a clear and committed Rural Economic Development Policy Statement, which outlines how Government intends to support integrated rural economic development to 2025.  The publication of the proposed <i>Charter for Rural Ireland</i>, to which the Deputy refers, is the first step in that process. Through the proposed <i>Charter for Rural Ireland</i>, it is intended to make a specific and public commitment to support rural Ireland&rsquo;s regeneration and to underpin the future sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s rural communities. I expect that this Charter will be brought to Government for approval shortly. </p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding the consultation process that was carried out when preparing the Charter, I can advise the Deputy that the work of CEDRA, including its final report , which included submissions from various interested parties, was used as a starting point for the development of the Charter.My Department also consulted with the CEDRA Expert Advisory Group and the CEDRA Inter - departmental Group , which comprises senior officials from various Departments whose work and remit impact on rural Ireland. </p><p>The focus of the Charter is on establishing frameworks and practices to support the rejuvenation of the rural economy and rural society. The objective of the Charter is to ensure that systems are in place to support enterprise creation and development, maintain and restore the rural cultural heritage, support and protect existing towns and other settlements, facilitate safe and secure rural communities and foster an increased quality of life for all rural dwellers. I am confident that the Charter for Rural Ireland, when delivered, will have a very positive impact on all rural areas , including in County Donegal.</p></reply>

The Strategy targets the delivery of 35,000 new units, to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies, and 75,000 units in the private rental market to be delivered mainly under the Housing Assistance Payment scheme.  The Strategy has been supported by two successive budgets with &euro;1.7 billion allocated to housing to support the provision of over 33,000 units across both Capital and Current programmes. Given the pressing need to recommence a house building programme around &euro;3 billion in capital funding will be provided in support of the Social Housing Strategy through the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan - Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021 .       </p>  <p>  The commitment of on-going financial support has allowed me to allocate half a billion euro to local authorities and approved housing bodies for 2,900 new social housing units to be delivered between now and 2017. </p>  <p>In terms of output in 2015 the target set is 15,900 across the current and capital programmes. All efforts are being made, working with delivery partners in local authorities, approved housing bodies and NAMA , to deliver maximum output under each delivery mechanism and this will continue right up to the year-end. The latest data , some of which relate to the position at end Quarter 3, indicate that over 1 0,0 00 units have been delivered across all the programmes so far in 2015. With the most significant share of delivery traditionally coming through in the last quarter of the year , I expect further significant progress to be reflected in the end-year position.</p>  <p>  Under the Ministerial Direction issued by Minister Kelly, which applies until 31 January 2016, key local authorities are required to prioritise homeless and other vulnerable households in the allocation of tenancies under their control. The four Dublin local authorities have been directed to allocate 50% of all available dwellings to such households, while the local authorities in counties Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford have been directed to allocate 30%. </p>  <p>In terms of households exiting homelessness, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive figures show that 739 households exited homelessness and entered into tenancy arrangements in the first 9 months of 2015 in the Dublin region.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-10a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121000056#WRA01050"><p>The figures referred to by the Deputy relate to the position at the end of June. The latest figures represent progress to the end of September 2015 , at which point a total of 1,600 NAMA related residential properties have been delivered for social housing use . This comprises of 1,241 completed properties and a further 359 that have been contracted and where completion work is on-going. A further 486 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal is being carried out. An additional 440 properties are to be further appraised. Overall, I expect that in excess of 2,000 units for social housing purposes will be secured from this engagement with NAMA. </p>  <p>  NAMA sourced units are brought into social housing use through existing delivery mechanisms including the Social Housing Investment Programme, the Capital Acquisition Scheme and the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). At the end of September 2015, 858 or 48% of the social housing units delivered by NAMA were by way of long term leasing funded by the SHCEP. I expect by year end, this will be well in excess of 50%. The current average monthly cost of operational NAMA units leased by Approved Housing Bodies or local authorities, and funded by SHCEP, is &euro;770 per unit per month. Monthly leasing arrangements under the SHCEP achieve significant discounts on market rents and are subject to regular rent reviews. In the case of NAMA related properties, average discounts achieved are in the region of 17% for houses and 12% for apartments. In addition, under these arrangements, rents are fixed for the first six years. </p>  <p>In the case of properties purchased, my Department does not distinguish the financing of NAMA sourced units from other sources of social housing supply. In every case, prices paid are determined by the independently determined market value.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-10a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121000056#WRA01200"><p>The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) continues to play an important role in the delivery of social housing. To the end of September 2015, a total of 1,600 NAMA residential properties had been delivered for social housing use, comprising 1,241 completed properties and a further 359 that have been contracted and where completion work is on-going. A further 486 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal is being carried out. An additional 440 properties are to be further appraised. Overall, I expect that in excess of 2,000 units will be secured for social housing purposes from this engagement with NAMA .    In addition, NAMA is funding the construction of new residential properties to help meet demand in the major urban centres . The overall programme will be funded from NAMA&rsquo;s own resources and will lead to the development of an estimated 20,000 units by 2020, mainly in the Greater Dublin area where the current residential supply shortage is most acute. Residential developments funded by NAMA are subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments and this includes policy relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.   As such, I expect 10% of the output of this investment by NAMA, or roughly 2,000 units ,     to become available for social housing. </p>  <p>NAMA&rsquo;s Special Purpose Vehicle - the &lsquo;National Asset Residential Property Services&rsquo; (NARPS) &ndash; was established in 2013 to facilitate the sale or lease of NAMA debtor or receiver residential properties for social housing purposes. In line with a commitment in the Social Housing Strategy   , its remit has been expanded to allow it to fund the purchase of Part V units which become available through NAMA&rsquo;s residential delivery programme. In this way, NAMA will continue to facilitate the provision of high quality units for social housing purposes in mixed tenure, sustainable communities and thus complement the extensive social housing construction programmes of local authorities also currently underway.</p></reply>

My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process. It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible. In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the WindGuidelines. My Department is advancing work on the Guidelines in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </p><p>The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

This process was conducted in a robust manner consistent with EU and national Procurement Guidelines. </p>  <p>  A meeting between Minister Kelly and Deputy Brendan Ryan was scheduled for 10 December 2014, to discuss the Senior Alerts Scheme. While it was not indicated that any other people would be attending the meeting, Deputy Ryan was, in fact, accompanied by two people who were part of a company that had bid in the tender process to establish a panel of preferred suppliers for the equipment needed for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, at what I am advised was ultimately a meeting of brief duration in respect of which minutes were not considered necessary. It is important to note that the assessment of the tenders including the award of contracts under the procurement process concerned was managed separately by Pobal, an independent company. </p>  <p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding procedures that exist for meetings that may take place , inadvertently, between Ministers or senior officials and bidders for contracts , a note of the meeting is generally taken where issues of a substantive nature are discussed and it would be usual to ensure, subsequently ,   that any such meeting did not affect the particular procurement process concerned. In the instance referred to by the Deputy   , I understand the meeting was of a brief duration and minutes were not considered necessary.

While the costs that local authorities might need to incur are not capped, support from my Department is subject to a limit of &euro;30,000 per unit.     This funding is not a substitute for the normal responsibilities of local authorities for maintaining their social housing properties and the standard end-of-lease maintenance they undertake is often sufficient to prepare a unit for early re-letting. Support is provided in respect of the additional costs that arise where remediation costs are higher than normal. The average exchequer contribution to local authorities under this programme is &euro;14,800 per unit. 2,333 units were returned under the programme in 2014, on top of units repaired using local authorities&rsquo; own resources. In 2015, funding has been made available to support the return of up to 2,500 further units, which covers all of the suitable units that the local authorities have identified. </p>  <p>  I recognise that there are other social housing units where there is a greater level of dereliction than can be addressed with the support currently available under the standard programme to remediate vacant units. Accordingly, my Department has also commenced a new programme to support local authorities to tackle those more extensively damaged units. The number of such units is relatively small but, nonetheless, this new funding programme will allow even more units that have been out of commission for many years to be brought back into use. The new programme will be rolled out in early 2016.</p></reply>

The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides for global valuations of utility undertakings, to be carried out by the Valuation Office every five years and entered on the central valuation list. The most recent global valuations carried out by the Valuation Office are in respect of Gas Networks Ireland, Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann and telecommunications companies BT Ireland, Eircom, Vodafone, Three Ireland and Meteor. On 4 November 2015 the Valuation Office issued a copy of the Valuation Certificate and a schedule setting out the apportioned value for each rating authority to my Department. The previous valuation for these utilities had taken place in 2010. The Global Valuation Certificates show a reduction in the combined valuations for these utilities of &euro;112m. Moreover, the reduction in the global valuation of the ESB, following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, will reduce the rates payable by the ESB from 2016.   </p>  <p>  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. This process has recently been concluded in each local authority as part of the budgeting process for 2016. The implications of the Commissioner of Valuation&rsquo;s global revaluation of utility infrastructure for individual local authorities will ultimately be dependent on each authority&rsquo;s ARV, and its overall income and expenditure decided on in its budget. </p>  <p>My Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and there will be a once off adjustment of &euro;16.65 million in support from the Local Government Fund in 2016 to local authorities affected by the global valuations.</p></reply>

The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides for global valuations of utility undertakings, to be carried out by the Valuation Office every five years and entered on the central valuation list. The most recent global valuations carried out by the Valuation Office are in respect of Gas Networks Ireland, Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann and telecommunications companies BT Ireland, Eircom, Vodafone, Three Ireland and Meteor. On 4 November 2015 the Valuation Office issued a copy of the Valuation Certificate and a schedule setting out the apportioned value for each rating authority to my Department. The previous valuation for these utilities had taken place in 2010. The Global Valuation Certificates show a reduction in the combined valuations for these utilities of &euro;112m. Moreover, the reduction in the global valuation of the ESB, following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, will reduce the rates payable by the ESB from 2016.   </p>  <p>  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. This process has recently been concluded in each local authority as part of the budgeting process for 2016. The implications of the Commissioner of Valuation&rsquo;s global revaluation of utility infrastructure for individual local authorities will ultimately be dependent on each authority&rsquo;s ARV, and its overall income and expenditure decided on in its budget. </p>  <p>  My Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and there will be a once off adjustment of &euro;16.65 million in support from the Local Government Fund in 2016 to local authorities affected by the global valuations.</p></reply>

The acquisition of properties is an important component of this delivery, as is the remediation of vacant units. This is particularly so given the time-lag in delivery for construction projects.  Local authorities already have devolved responsibility to undertake suitable acquisitions of properties for social housing purposes, while being sensitive to local market conditions and achieving good value for money. The acquisition of units, therefore, is already underway and will continue to be used by local authorities where appropriate, alongside other social housing delivery mechanisms such as construction - including modular housing - and the delivery of NAMA residential properties, making units available through the local authority leasing scheme, the rental accommodation scheme and the Housing Assistance Payment scheme.   </p>  <p>In line with the Social Housing Strategy, all of these approaches are required for the delivery of social housing in the short, medium and long-terms and I am satisfied that they are being advanced strongly by local authorities and approved housing bodies.   </p>  <p>The programme for the delivery of 500 units of modular housing for homeless families across Dublin is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless families accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements.

The output target for 2015 is set at 15,900 across the current and capital-funded programmes. Within that, a target of 2,400 units is to delivered through the capital-funded programmes of building/acquiring new social housing units by local authorities, new sheltered housing by approved housing bodies, and the returning of vacant properties to productive use. Current data shows that over 2,500 units have already been delivered through the capital programmes as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>No.</th></tr><tr><td>Local Authority Housing &ndash; construction and acquisition </td><td>569 </td></tr><tr><td>Capital Assistance Scheme </td><td>199 </td></tr><tr><td>Regeneration </td><td>109 </td></tr><tr><td>Vacant Units returned </td><td>1,630 </td></tr></table></p><p>Local authorities have advised me that they are advancing the purchase of some 750 new units this year, many of which will be finalised between now and the end of the year, which is traditionally the time of greatest funding drawdown by local authorities. Combined with the further numbers of vacant housing units that I expect will be returned by the end of this year, this should mean that the capital target for 2015 will be further exceeded. All 31 local authorities are actively engaged in the delivery of these units in 2015, so the impact will be felt across all areas in terms of new social housing provision.</p><p>We now have a strong pipeline of new social housing construction projects in place following from the announcement in May of the first major social housing build programme under the Social Housing Strategy, with a further substantial announcement in July of approvals for local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The outcome has been half a billion euro allocated for 2,900 social housing new builds and acquisitions to end 2017. I also propose to make further announcements in this regard early in the New Year. Coupled with new housing acquisitions and tackling vacant units, this means that progress towards achievement of the overall capital targets for the period out to 2017 is well advanced.</p></reply>

The Council is aiming to secure the delivery of an initial 22 of these units before Christmas, with commencement of delivery of the remaining units to follow by late Q1 2016.

The Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 Strategy, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed. A number of important measures have been taken already aimed at improving housing viability and increasing supply. The measures include the introduction of a vacant site levy, reductions in development contributions, revised Part V provisions and initiatives to improve financing.</p><p>Given that these measures will take time to fully impact on supply, some shorter term measures have recently been agreed by Government, including:</p><p>- a targeted development contribution rebate scheme in Dublin and Cork, focussed on large scale developments at affordable prices;</p><p>- fast-tracking of implementation of new apartment guidelines which while supporting good quality build, will improve the viability of this type of development; and</p><p>- legislative amendments to introduce greater flexibility and streamlining to the Strategic Development Zone provisions of the Planning and Development Acts.</p><p>In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area. </p><p>In terms of social housing, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list with flexibility to meet future demand. In total, 110,000 new social housing units are targeted for delivery with 35,000 new units to be delivered and 75,000 households to be supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.</p><p>The Strategy has been supported by two successive budgets with &euro;1.7 billion allocated to housing.

The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) and Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) are key delivery programmes under the Social Housing Strategy.   </p>  <p>  In the case of RAS, the Scheme was established with the dual purpose of eliminating long-term dependence on the Supplementary Welfare Allowance rent supplementation scheme and enhancing the capacity of local authorities to respond to long-term housing need. Under the Scheme, value for money can be viewed in a number of ways and can reflect both direct and indirect financial costs and benefits. The cost of the Scheme is determined by the on-going cost of meeting contractual commitments with property owners. Local authorities, in negotiating contracts with property owners, seek to maximise a discount on market rent. The funding to support the cost of RAS is made available through the redirection of resources from the Department of Social Protection. Monies are provided on an Exchequer neutral basis to meet the cost of persons transferring from rent supplement to RAS. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), units provided in long-term leased arrangements are subject to formal, professional valuation procedures to agree rents payable, and for the most part require Departmental approval. In respect of proposals examined by the Department, an average discount of 20% below market rent is being achieved. In addition, regular rent reviews are specified in each agreement. </p>  <p>The Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP) scheme, which is currently being rolled out on a pilot basis, has been designed with the intention of providing efficiencies to both tenants and landlords, and value for money for the Exchequer. As well as removing a barrier to employment, by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment, the HAP scheme improves regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and it provides certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, payments are made electronically directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant, and the tenancy agreement is between the HAP recipient and the private landlord. In order to test HAP processes and provide efficiencies, Limerick City and County Council are currently providing a transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities on an interim basis. This shared service structure   ensures greater consistency of processes, and resource efficiencies, by managing all HAP tenants and landlords through   one Financial Management System.     The operation of the pilot has facilitated a better understanding of the business and operational requirements, including identifying areas where efficiencies can be gained. </p>  <p>While my Department keeps its housing delivery mechanisms under regular review, I am satisfied that the RAS, SHCEP and HAP schemes represent good value for money for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015.  In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low carbon plan, the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. In this context, key sectors in the low carbon transition process (electricity, transport, built environment and agriculture) are currently developing sectorial mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.   </p>  <p>Development of the National Mitigation Plan is being   guided by a long-term vision of low carbon transition, as set out in the National Policy Position based on:</p>  <p>  - an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and</p>  <p>- in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.   </p>  <p>The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this vision by 2050. In that context, the National Mitigation Plan now being developed will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.   </p>  <p>I have no plans at this time to introduce sectorial targets. As noted above, the National Policy Position sets out the ambition level for the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors in aggregate rather than as individual sectorial objectives. This is to ensure that it can be achieved at minimum cost. The proposed iterative process to pursue and achieve this aggregate ambition level will allow Departments and Government collectively to establish the most cost-efficient options at a point in time. Inevitably, the cost of some technologies will reduce over time and the least-cost transition advice and trajectory will evolve accordingly.</p></reply>

The provision for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  </p><p>A breakdown of rent supplement recipients in Louth and Meath is provided in the attached tabular statements. Rent supplement expenditure from 2011 to 2015 is also provided. A breakdown of expenditure by county is not available.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic direction is to transfer responsibility of persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under HAP.  There are currently over 1,500 recipients of rent supplement in Louth of which 1,240 are in receipt of the scheme for periods over 18 months. To date, approximately 240 long term rent supplement recipients in Louth have transferred to HAP. The complete transfer of all long term recipients to HAP will take place over a period of time. </p><p>In local authority areas where HAP is in place, including Louth and Meath, new applicants assessed as requiring social housing support will be considered for HAP rather than rent supplement. Rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require a short term income support to pay their rent. HAP recipients whose landlords refuse to renew their tenancy should engage with their local authority. Policy responsibility and reporting on HAP is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>In view of the current difficulties in the private rented market, rent supplement policy continues to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the scheme. Under this approach each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate. Community Welfare Service staff have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness.  In addition the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where the supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this protocol to Galway City. I am keeping this matter under review including any further extension of the Protocol in place with Threshold.</p><p>Where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss, the preventative measures are implemented as appropriate. This flexible approach has supported over 5,400 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments, of which 71 cases refer to householders in Louth. A county breakdown of this information is provided in the attached tabular statement.  </p><p>The Department has undertaken a communications campaign to encourage people at risk to avail of these measures and the Tenancy Protection Service (if in Dublin or Cork city) including the issue of text messages to circa 50,000 rent supplement recipients; updating messages on the Department&rsquo;s website and monthly tweeting of information; updating the Citizens Information homepage and their micro site &ldquo;keepingyourhome.ie&rdquo;. A national poster campaign was also launched with posters distributed locally to Department offices, Post Offices, libraries, credit unions, etc.  </p><p>I believe that these measures - and the reforms to the private rental sector announced last month - will continue to provide adequate support to rent supplement customers and will provide increased certainty for both tenants and landlords in the current market. </p><p>Table 1:Number of Rent Supplement Recipients by County, 2011 to date<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015<br /><br />End Nov</th></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>2,734</td><td>2,549</td><td>2,422</td><td>2,211</td><td>1,508</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>2,723</td><td>2,143</td><td>1,941</td><td>1,726</td><td>1,538</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 2: Rent Supplement Expenditure: 2011 to date<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cost &euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>502,747</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>422,536</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>372,909</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>338,347</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>298,415 1</td></tr></table></p><p>1Revised 2015 Expenditure</p><p>Table 2: Total Increased Rental Payments by County under Rent Supplement at 07/12//2015<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>21</td><td></td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>13</td><td></td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>204</td><td>68</td><td>272</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>2,058</td><td>1,588</td><td>3,646</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>101</td><td></td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>18</td><td></td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>189</td><td></td><td>189</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>110</td><td></td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>97</td><td></td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>44</td><td></td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>90</td><td></td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>71</td><td></td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>235</td><td></td><td>235</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>49</td><td></td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>12</td><td></td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>165</td><td></td><td>165</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>26</td><td></td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>89</td><td></td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>82</td><td></td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,752</td><td>1,656</td><td>5,408</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;27.9m for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2015. </p>  <p>  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Assistance through ENPs may be provided towards rent deposits. The Department has agreed to provide assistance for rent deposits in respect of Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) tenancies pending the introduction of a deposit protection scheme. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs.  </p>  <p>  The Department made over 2,300 payments of rent deposits/rent in advance to the end of November 2015, costing approximately &euro;1.3 million. This includes the payment of 40 rent deposits in County Louth. </p>  <p>  Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP under the SWA scheme should contact the Department.</p></reply>

By the end of November 2015 there have been just over 10,500 applicants for BTWFD with over 10,000 of those currently in receipt of a payment. Through these payments the dividend is providing support in respect of over 17,000 children.  </p>  <p>  The back to work family dividend aims to help families to move from a weekly social welfare payment into employment.  It gives financial support to people with children who were in receipt of a jobseeker or one-parent family payment and who take up employment, increase their hours of employment or become self-employed.  </p>  <p>  If a person qualifies for the dividend for their first year in employment they will get a weekly payment equivalent to the increases for qualified children they were being paid on their jobseeker or one-parent family payment.  This is up to a maximum of 4 children. Half that weekly amount will be paid for the second year in employment.  This means that over the two years, a family with one child will receive additional support of &euro;2,324 to supplement wages. A family with two children will receive &euro;4,649; those with three children will get &euro;6,973, while those with four or more will get &euro;9,298.</p>  <p>  My officials are constantly monitoring take up of the scheme and seeking ways to improve awareness of the dividend among jobseekers.  My Department has given an undertaking to formally review the operation and effectiveness of the dividend by the end of 2017.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-10a.159.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121000059#WRD01200"><p>I must first point out to the Deputy that NAMA does not directly deliver housing. In cases where residential development is commercially viable, NAMA funds such development in order that its debtors and receivers can maximise their repayment of debt and deliver a surplus to taxpayers. I am advised that, as part of any NAMA-funded residential development, NAMA debtors and receivers will abide by their Part V obligation to deliver 10% of the stock as social housing.</p>  <p>  It is neither equitable nor feasible to impose different social housing obligations on developers, based purely on their sources of development finance. To impose on a NAMA debtor a higher obligation to deliver social housing than is imposed, for instance, on a developer who is funded by a bank or who has access to other sources of finance, would be arbitrary and discriminatory.  From the perspective of a NAMA debtor, their capacity to redeem their debt is a primary consideration and imposing additional obligations over and above the obligations that are imposed on a debtor outside NAMA would reduce their capacity to repay their debt.</p>  <p>  As I recently pointed out in Parliamentary Question 171 of 8 December 2015, NAMA cannot subvent the supply of social housing.  Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for taxpayers.  In line with NAMA's obligations under Section 10, all residential projects will be required to pass a stringent commercial viability threshold before NAMA approves funding and funding will only be made available if it is expected to increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded. NAMA must act akin to a private sector commercial entity.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, NAMA has already played a very important role in facilitating, on a commercial basis, the supply of houses and apartments for social housing from within its existing portfolio. By the end of this year, NAMA will have facilitated the supply of 2,000 houses and apartments for social housing through its debtors and receivers.  This equates to more than one-third of total social housing provision under Part V (Social Housing) legislation in the years between 2002 and 2011.  It should also be noted that NAMA originally made over 6,500 houses and apartments available for social housing under this commercial initiative but local authorities confirmed demand for just over 2,500 of these.</p>  <p>  The core housing issue we face is that of insufficient supply of housing generally, which impacts the supply of social housing, starter homes and all other categories of housing, particularly in the greater Dublin area.  Any contribution to the overall supply of housing will therefore have a positive impact for housing across all categories.  Therefore, NAMA's contribution to the housing market and by association social housing is timely and welcome.</p>  <p>  NAMA's commercial funding programme, being an independent and commercial initiative, does not contradict or lessen the Government's commitment to deliver on our Social Housing 2020 strategy.  We are also combining these long term measures with interim solutions to deal with the immediate issues that families currently face.  This is why Budget 2016 increased the current allocation for social housing by &euro;69 million to &euro;414 million. This will enable local authorities to secure accommodation for an additional 14,000 households. </p>  <p>  Under the Government's 6 year capital investment framework, "Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021", which was recently announced by Minister Howlin, the current allocation for emergency accommodation for the homeless, has been increased by &euro;17 million. This increase will bring Exchequer support to &euro;70 million, which amounts to a 56% increase since last year. This injection of funding will help the homeless transition to long term sustainable housing.</p>  <p>  The Government also recently agreed on a package of measures designed to give certainty to tenants in relation to their rent, to better protect tenants in their homes and to provide clarity to both tenants and landlords as regards their rights and obligations. The primary measure in this package is the amendment of the Residential Tenancies Act so that rent reviews for all tenancies will take place every 24 months, rather than every 12 months as currently is the case. This will provide tenants with a longer period of predictable rent. </p>  <p>  Therefore, addressing the issues facing the housing market generally, social housing, and homelessness, particularly among families, are clearly key priorities for this Government and I can assure the Deputy that NAMA's residential funding programme are complementary to, rather than in lieu of, the Government's commitments.</p></reply>

The Earned Income Credit is available to taxpayers with active self-employed trading or professional income, and to business owner/managers who do not have access to the PAYE credit on salary income from their business.

It should be noted some of these figures are provisional. While the majority of these schemes have been terminated (capital allowances have been retained for expenditure on hotels, holiday camps, holiday hostels, guest house and registered caravan and camping sites at a rate of 4% per annum over 25 years), tax relief may continue to be claimed on expenditure incurred prior to the termination date in question.<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Number of Claimants</th><th>Tax Cost - &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Urban Renewal</td><td>2,664</td><td>46.0</td></tr><tr><td>Town Renewal</td><td>749</td><td>10.9</td></tr><tr><td>Seaside Resort</td><td>286</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>Rural Renewal</td><td>2,198</td><td>18.5</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-storey car parks</td><td>57</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Living Over the Shop</td><td>41</td><td>0.6</td></tr><tr><td>Student Accommodation</td><td>537</td><td>11.9</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise  Areas</td><td>105</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>Park and Ride</td><td>17</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>Hotels</td><td>1,017</td><td>35.5</td></tr><tr><td>Holiday Cottages</td><td>574</td><td>11.0</td></tr><tr><td>Holiday Hostels</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>Guest Houses</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>Nursing Homes</td><td>418</td><td>10.9</td></tr><tr><td>Housing for the Elderly/Infirm</td><td>100</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Convalescent Homes</td><td>12</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying Hospitals</td><td>357</td><td>9.2</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying Mental Health Centres</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying Sports Injury Clinics</td><td>82</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Buildings used for certain Childcare Purposes</td><td>304</td><td>4.4</td></tr><tr><td>Buildings or structures in registered Caravan camp; Camping sites</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment Scheme</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr></table></p><p>* indicates that the number of claimants is low (usually less than 10) and cannot be provided to protect taxpayer confidentiality.</p><p>As statistics were not captured separately for Third Level Educational Buildings and the Countrywide Refurbishment Scheme (both now terminated) these have not been included.  Also not included are the ordinary industrial buildings (e.g., mill/factory and airport runways/buildings) as statistics are not captured separately for these either. </p><p>The Living City Initiative and incentives for certain Aviation Services Facilities were commenced in 2015. The earliest point at which statistics for the number of persons availing of these reliefs and the total cost to the Exchequer may become available is when tax returns for 2015 have been filed.</p><p><b>Home Renovation Incentive (HRI)</b></p><p>This scheme provides a tax relief by way of an income tax credit on repair, renovation or improvement works on principal private residences or rental property carried out by tax compliant contractors. In addition to providing an income tax relief, the HRI also aims to support tax compliance in the building industry by moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy. </p><p>The year 2014 was the first full year in which the incentive operated. The incentive came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2016. Rental properties were brought within the scheme from 15 October 2014. </p><p>Since the introduction of the incentive, works on 31,719 properties have been notified to Revenue's HRI online system (as of 30 November 2015).  This represents more than &euro;695 million worth of works involving some 6,705 contractors. The potential total cost to the Exchequer in respect of these properties is approximately &euro;47m. As a claim for the HRI credit can only be made in the year after works have been paid for, there was no cost to the Exchequer in 2014 (works paid for in the period from 25 October 2013 to 31 December 2013 were deemed to have been paid for in 2014). </p><p><b>Additional Income Tax Reliefs</b></p><p>Other property based reliefs include interest relief on loans to acquire a principal private residence (PPR) (terminated for any new cases after 31 December 2012 interest relief for PPRs purchased between 2004 and 2012 will continue until end 2017), relief for rental payments on private tenancies (terminated for any new cases after 7 December 2010 - Individuals who were in receipt of the relief at 7 December 2010 may continue to claim it until 2017) the rent-a-room relief and relief for expenditure on significant buildings or gardens. The cost of the reliefs and the number claiming the relief are set out on the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. </th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>Year 2014</td><td>Number of claimants</td><td>Cost - &euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>Mortgage interest relief for PPRs</td><td>495,000</td><td>266.0</td></tr><tr><td>Year 2013</td><td>Number of claimants</td><td>Cost - &euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>Rent-a-room relief</td><td>4,370</td><td>5.9</td></tr><tr><td>Expenditure on significant buildings or gardens</td><td>120</td><td>2.1</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax Reliefs</b></p><p>For the purpose of capital gains tax there are three significant property based reliefs, the property purchase incentive, the Principal Private Residence relief and the farm restructuring relief.</p><p>The property purchase incentive relief was introduced in the Finance Act 2012. The relief applies to properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014. For the relief to apply, the property must be owned for a period of at least 7 years. The rationale for the relief was to encourage investment in Irish property at a time when the property market was at low ebb. </p><p>The Principal Private Residence Relief is available for individuals disposing of a house which was occupied by them as their only or main residence. The rationale for the relief is to ensure that the sale of a house, which will generally be replaced with another house, can be done on a tax-neutral basis.  </p><p>Farm restructuring relief was introduced in the Finance Act 2013. The rationale for the relief is to facilitate the consolidation of land holdings, thereby increasing the productivity of those land holdings. </p><p>There is no statistical information available to the numbers availing of the Principal Private Residence relief and the farm restructuring relief or their cost to the Exchequer. The property purchase incentive had no cost to the Exchequer in the past full year since the entitlement to avail of the relief will not arise until a future point in time.</p><p><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax</b></p><p>The property based reliefs available for the purposes of capital acquisitions tax are set out on the following table. Costs and numbers availing relate to 2014.<table><tr><th>Relief</th><th>Rationale for relief</th></tr><tr><td>Reduction of 90% in market value of agricultural property</td><td>To encourage entrepreneurial activity and the inter-generational transfer of business.</td></tr><tr><td>Reduction of 90% in market value of business property</td><td>To encourage entrepreneurial activity and the inter-generational transfer of business.</td></tr><tr><td>Exemption from CAT on the inheritance or gift of a residential property where the beneficiary has lived in the property as a sole or main residence for a specified period both before and after the inheritance/gift. </td><td>To prevent hardship for home-sharers.</td></tr><tr><td>Spouses and civil partners</td><td>Gifts and inheritances of property between spouses and civil partners are exempt from CAT.</td></tr><tr><td>Public or charitable purposes</td><td>To exempt from CAT gifts/inheritances of property where the property is applied for purposes that are public or charitable.</td></tr><tr><td>Heritage properties</td><td>To exempt from CAT gifts/inheritances of houses/gardens that are of national, historic or artistic interest and where there are reasonable viewing facilities offered to the public.</td></tr></table></p><p><b>&quot;</b>N/A&quot; indicates that the figures are not available.</p><p><b>Valued Added Tax</b></p><p>The VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides for the making of Orders whereby VAT that has been paid may be refunded in certain circumstances. Three Refund Orders provide for the possibility of recovering VAT associated with property.  </p><p>-  VAT Refund Order (No. 15) of 1981 allows for certain construction costs incurred in the adaptation of a house for certain qualifying disabled persons.

In the event of a sale before the next liability date of 1 November 2016, the exemption continues to be available for the purchasers of such properties.  </td></tr><tr><td>Special needs accommodation</td><td>To provide relief for charitable and social housing bodies who own properties that are made available to persons who require special accommodation and support to enable them to live in the community because of old age, physical or mental infirmity or other reason. </td></tr><tr><td>Recreational activities</td><td>To provide relief for charitable bodies who own properties that are used solely as residential accommodation to facilitate recreational activities in the course of carrying out the body's main purpose.</td></tr><tr><td>Purchases in 2013</td><td>To provide relief, following the termination of mortgage interest relief, for persons who purchased properties during 2013 and who occupy the properties as their sole or main residence. </td></tr><tr><td>Unfinished housing estates</td><td>To provide relief, as had been done in relation to the Household Charge, to owners of properties that were located in housing estates that were certified as 'unfinished' by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</td></tr><tr><td>Pyrite damage</td><td>To provide relief to owners of properties that have been appropriately certified as having been damaged to a significant extent by pyrite.</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacitated persons</td><td>To provide relief for owners of properties that have been acquired or adapted because of their suitability, or to make them suitable, for occupation by persons who are totally and permanently incapacitated from maintaining themselves by earning a living from working and whose condition dictates the type of property they can live in.</td></tr><tr><td>Reduced chargeable value of property </td><td>Rationale for reduction in chargeable value</td></tr><tr><td>Property adapted for occupation by certain disabled persons </td><td>To provide relief for owners of properties who have had to incur expenditure on construction or adaptation work to make the properties suitable for occupation by certain disabled persons where the work has the effect of increasing the value of the properties so that they move into a higher LPT valuation band with a higher tax liability. </td></tr><tr><td>Deferral of payment of LPT</td><td>Rationale for deferral</td></tr><tr><td>Income threshold</td><td>To provide relief for persons whose annual income does not exceed a specified threshold by allowing them to defer payment of either the full or partial LPT liability until their circumstances improve or their property ceases to be owned by them. </td></tr><tr><td>Estate of deceased person</td><td>To provide relief for executors and administrators of a deceased person's estate to give them an opportunity to transfer ownership of any residential property to a beneficiary or to sell the property and distribute the proceeds of sale.</td></tr><tr><td>Insolvency</td><td>To provide relief for persons who have entered into certain formalised insolvency arrangements for the management of their debts until such time as the arrangements cease to have effect.</td></tr><tr><td>Hardship</td><td>To provide relief for persons who suffer a significant financial loss or incur a significant expense that is unexpected and unavoidable and as a result of which are unable to pay their LPT liability. </td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to the LPT exemptions, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer for 2014, the most recent year available, is estimated to be &euro;12 million in total. Exemptions have been claimed for around 41,000 properties.  LPT deferrals have resulted in delayed LPT receipts estimated at &euro;7 million in 2014. Claims for deferral have been made in respect of around 27,000 properties for 2014.  I am further advised that costs for individual exemptions or deferrals are not available at this time.</p><p><b>Stamp Duty</b></p><p>Finally, the following table sets out the relief or exemption from stamp duty for transactions associated with property.

NAMA must act akin to a private sector commercial entity in this respect.  </p>  <p>  NAMA is not a property developer.  NAMA's role in relation to new housing output is, like a bank, that of a secured lender which makes a commercial decision to advance funding to maximise its return.  As a secured lender, NAMA provides funding to its debtors and receivers where it is shown that this will increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded.  Residential projects funded by NAMA are delivered by NAMA's debtors and receivers who are subject to the same planning requirements as all other applicants in the planning process, including Part V legislation which requires the provision of 10% of their housing units for social housing.  </p>  <p>  Government recently amended Part V to remove the ability of developers to account for their social housing commitments through cash payments to local authorities and furthermore to ensure that the social housing will be located predominantly on the site of the original developments, not off-site as had been a feature of Part V since its introduction.  NAMA debtors and receivers will fulfil their Part V obligation to deliver 10% of residential units in the form of on-site social housing units. </p>  <p>  NAMA has stated publicly its intention to facilitate, where feasible, the provision by its debtors and receivers of future Part V housing on NAMA-funded developments through its social housing SPV, NARPS. This is a very important initiative, which means that NAMA, as opposed to the relevant local authority, will, in many cases, bear the up-front capital cost of delivering Part V housing on estates it funds and that such housing will, in line with Government policy be aimed at ensuring greater integration in housing, be delivered on-site. </p>  <p>  Any delivery via NARPS, through Part V or otherwise, must be on a commercial basis in line with Section 10 of the NAMA Act.  In this regard, NARPS leases properties to either local authorities or approved housing bodies on the basis of commercial long-term lease arrangements which include an option for the local authority or approved housing body to buy the leased unit. </p>  <p>  Part V agreements are facilitated through the Planning Process and the design and planning specification of new houses and apartments are determined in the planning consent by reference to national and local policy and standards.  NAMA does not own properties, is not a developer and NAMA is not a planning applicant in any instance so NAMA is not a direct party in the planning process, so while it may facilitate development, NAMA does not negotiate housing specification with local authorities as this is a reserved function of the planning process.  </p>  <p>  NAMA has already played a very important role in facilitating on a commercial basis the supply of houses and apartments from within its existing portfolio for social housing.  By the end of this year, NAMA will have facilitated the supply of 2,000 houses and apartments for social housing through its debtors and receivers under this initiative and NARPS, alongside the direct leasing or sale by NAMA debtors and receivers, is an important mechanism in ensuring this supply.  Properties are leased by NARPS to approved housing bodies on the basis of long-term leasing arrangements.  The NARPS lease provides, typically, for up to an average 20% discount to market rents, with the rent fixed for the first six years, and reviewed every three years thereafter, and includes an option for the approved housing body to purchase the property outright after a number of years at market value.  The discount reflects the fact that the local authority and\or approved housing body take full responsibility for property maintenance and repairs over the lifetime of the lease.  NAMA expects to have delivered close to 800 units out of end-2015 figure of 2,000 through the NARPS mechanism.</p>  <p>  The 2,000 units that will be delivered by NAMA from within its existing portfolio by the end of this year for social housing equates to more than one-third of total social housing provision under Part V in the years between 2002 and 2011.  This underlines the important contribution that NAMA has already made in this area.  It should also be noted that NAMA originally made over 6,500 houses and apartments from within its existing portfolio available for social housing under this commercial initiative but local authorities confirmed demand for just over 2,500 of these.    </p>  <p>  Decisions relating to the disposal of the social housing portfolio leased by NARPS or to the possible dissolution of NARPS will be a matter for the NAMA Board to make at the appropriate time in the future. However, possible options could include selling the SPV at market value as part of NAMA's ongoing deleveraging, in which case a market participant would keep the long term lease arrangements with local authorities in place, or allowing local authorities to buy the properties from NAMA.</p>  <p>  While there may be commercially attractive opportunities in the social housing sector, any such opportunities are based upon the current social housing delivery model of direct Exchequer subvention.  As previously  stated, NAMA cannot provide that subvention.  </p>  <p>  It is clear however that the social housing supply problem is a subset of the wider supply problem in the property market and NAMA's funding commitment in terms of commercially viable residential output will be part of the overall housing solution, although it can only part of the solution.   </p>  <p>  Looking at the private market, NAMA debtors and receivers control only about 30% of zoned residential sites in the Dublin area and accordingly, market participants who control the other 70% of the sites also have a major role to play if the supply/demand imbalance is to be addressed in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  The Government is examining what role it can play in supporting increased output by the wider development sector and in particular is examining how to address infrastructure deficits that are holding up the supply of commercially viable new housing in the main urban growth centres.</p></reply>

This means that performance-related payments and retention payments made in 2014 and in 2015 amounted to &euro;136,500 and &euro;199,200 respectively.

There are three such contract completion arrangements outstanding and a total of &euro;196,250 potentially remains to be paid to the employees in question upon completion of their fixed-term contracts. No contract completion payments will be made to any of the three employees in question if they become a permanent employee. </p>  <p>  The practice of entering into employment contracts providing for retention payments or contract completion payments has been discontinued. No retention arrangement has been entered into since mid 2014. None of the arrangements described above extend beyond 2017.</p></reply>

All the observations received from concerned parties have been answered.  Detailed design of the scheme will commence shortly, which will be followed by a procurement process for a civil works contractor and the formal Confirmation of the Scheme by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts. Subject to successful completion of the tender and Confirmation processes, it is hoped that construction will start in late 2016 or early 2017.</p>  <p>  The position with regard to the Bandon Flood Relief Scheme is that the second stage of a tender competition for a civil works contractor is underway. Tender documentation has been issued to the short-listed candidates and tenders are due back in early January.  The Scheme will shortly be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (PER) for formal Confirmation of the Scheme as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts. The Minister will be required to undertake an independent review of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to ensure that all legislative requirements have been complied with before the Scheme can be approved.  It is planned that works will commence in the summer of 2016.</p>  <p>  The Skibbereen Flood Relief Scheme has been submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for Confirmation and is also subject to an independent review of the EIS. Cork County Council is the Contracting Authority for the Skibbereen Scheme and the Council is progressing the process to procure a civil works contractor. Approval for the contractor appointment by the OPW as the sponsoring and funding agent must await the formal Confirmation of the Scheme by the Minister. It is hoped that this process will be completed in early 2016, which will allow construction of the Scheme to be commenced in mid-2016. </p>  <p>  It is expected that the Clonakilty, Bandon and Skibbereen Schemes will take approximately 24-30 months to complete.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to the provision of flood relief schemes for the people of Bandon, Skibbereen and Clonakilty and the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing these schemes in its financial profiles over the years 2016-2018.</p></reply>

This is a remarkable outcome and testifies to the strength of the consultation process which has lead to the design of a scheme which seems to answer a great many of the needs of the sector. The second tranche of the Organic Farming Scheme is now open for farmers who wish to convert to organic farming in 2016 and to organic farmers whose current contract ends on 31 December 2015. The closing date for the Scheme is 31 December 2015.  The requirement for a further tranche will be reviewed in 2016 mindful of expressions of interest and availability of funding.</p></reply>

The corresponding off farm income limit under the previous National Reserve was &euro;30,000. Applicants under the 2015 National Reserve also have the flexibility of choosing either the 2013 or 2014 tax year, whichever is more advantageous.  Applicants must comply with all eligibility criteria including off farm income criteria in order to be deemed eligible to qualify for an allocation of entitlements under the National Reserve. By increasing the off-farm income limit and granting a choice of reference years, I have granted the maximum possible flexibility regarding income limits for the National Reserve.

Many applicants cannot be paid until early next year when they have complied with stocking density and retention terms of the scheme.  In relation to the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening Payment, I am pleased to confirm that advance payments began issuing in Ireland on 16 October   2015.   This is the earliest that payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.  In addition, I can confirm that the level of the advance payment was set at 70% for 2015 rather than the normal 50%.  The increase in the advance payment for 2015 is, in particular, due to the difficulties encountered in the dairying and pigmeat sectors. </p>  <p>Ireland is among the earliest to pay the BPS in the European Union and to date, of the approximately 122,265 eligible applicants, 11 7,380 farmers have received payments totalling &euro;1.0 25 billion.</p>  <p>  It is not permissible under the governing EU legislation to make partial payments in respect of unclear cases. Work is continuing in my Department to prioritise the processing of outstanding cases for payment under both schemes. Regular pay runs are in place to pay applicants as cases are cleared for payment.

The lump sum received at retirement was subject to repayment and arrangements were made to cease payment of pension from the day before the date of re-instatement.   </p>  <p>  Circular 22/07 which is the current circular covering ill-health retirement does not provide civil servants with an automatic right to return to work.

The balancing payments commenced on 1 December.A total of 97% of eligible applicants in Cavan and 98% of eligible applicants in Monaghan have been paid under the BPS.</p><p>I can also confirm that payments under the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme commenced, on schedule, on 23 Sept ember 2015. A total of 85% of eligible applicants in Cavan and 83% of eligible applicants in Monaghan have been paid under the ANC Scheme. It shouldbe noted that many farmers cannot be paid until early 2016 when they comply with the stocking requirements of the scheme. </p><p>As outstanding cases under the BPS, Greening and ANC are processed and are cleared of any outstanding error, they will be sent for payment.  My Department is prioritising the processing of all such outstanding cases with regular payment runs continuing over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Indeed, the letter advising the person concerned of the Minister's decision also informed her that she may reapply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation at any time.  The letter advised that, when considering making such a re-application, she should give due regard to the reasons for the refusal which were contained in the submission attached to the refusal letter and that any further application will be considered taking into account all statutory and administrative conditions applicable at the time of application.</p>  <p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Upon receipt of the requested information, or in the event that the person concerned does not respond, the case will be further processed and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.   The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The rates of payment are set out in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2013.</p>  <p>  Where a GP currently holds the Rural Practice Allowance but the circumstances underpinning this have changed, the GP retains the allowance while they continue to practise in this location.  However, an application for the allowance is considered afresh by the HSE when a new GP commences in the area.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently produced revised Rural Practice Allowance guidelines for remote rural areas.  The purpose of the new guidance is to ensure consistency, transparency and fairness in decision-making regarding relevant discretionary provisions of the GMS contract as they apply to rural GP practices.</p>  <p>  The guidance also provides for greater flexibility in considering applications from GPs than was provided for in the original governing circular, as well as providing additional options to support GPs.  The new guidance does not affect existing holders of the allowance.</p>  <p>  With regard to GP dispensing arrangements under the GMS Scheme, such arrangements may cease in certain circumstances, e.g. where a pharmacy opens within three miles of the relevant GP&rsquo;s main centre of practice.</p>  <p>  The HSE, Department of Health and Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs.  It is envisaged that the issue of supports for General Practice in remote rural areas and dispensing arrangements will be considered under this review process.</p>  <p>  Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI), the &ldquo;distance from the GP&rsquo;s surgery&rdquo; was removed as a factor in calculating certain fees payable to GPs under the GMS Scheme.  Any reversal of this measure would have to be considered in the context of the review of fee adjustments introduced under FEMPI for contracted professionals in the health sector, which will be undertaken shortly.</p></reply>

Current estimates are that the core hospital, including both satellite centres, will be delivered within this envelope.  This includes provision for inflation, VAT and contingencies; it does not include equipment or ICT which can be purchased, licensed or leased separately. Philanthropic and commercial funding streams will be targeted as appropriate for supporting elements of the project to include car parking, academic and research facilities, and estimates will continue to be reviewed and refined at each stage of the project. I do not intend to provide further detail on the cost breakdown at this stage, on the basis of commercial sensitivity.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-10a.435.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015121000063#WRH03900"><p>Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, known as the Keane Report, recommended that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility. Nonetheless, it is clear that there are people &ndash; including children - with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. </p>  <p>  Consequently, the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility was established by the HSE to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme. However, the Clinical Advisory Group has not recommended that children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance should automatically qualify for a medical card. In advance of the Group completing its work, there are no proposals to issue automatic medical cards to one particular group.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to making the medical card system as responsive as possible to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs. As a result of a range of improvements, the HSE is exercising greater discretion. Consequently, the number of discretionary medical cards has increased by about 84% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, the proper way to address this issue is to develop a system of universal health care, which is at the centre of Government health policy. Otherwise, whenever there are qualifying rules, there will always be a person who is above the means test, does not have the selected disease, or is not in receipt of the specific social welfare payment.</p></reply>

My Department will continue to liaise with Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board and An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta in this regard.  </p><p>Among my Department's responsibilities is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places in an area.  In relation to enrolment policies, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  It is only where a school is over-subscribed that it can deploy a selection process.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p><p>The specific school in County Dublin to which the Deputy refers was established a number of years ago to cater for all-Irish post-primary demand in the area and was built to cater for 600 pupils.

From 1845 onwards model schools were established and managed by local inspectors. Model schools were found to be an unduly expensive method of training teachers, and their use for this purpose ceased from about 1883 onwards, the schools continuing to function as ordinary schools.  The functions of the National Education Board were taken over by the Department of Education and the model schools continued to be managed by inspectors and funded by the Department.  The Education Act 1998 placed the patronage of schools on a statutory basis. The Minister as owner of the model schools became the Patron of the model schools in accordance with the terms of the Act.  The schools operate as Catholic or Protestant schools in accordance with the historic traditions that go back to their foundation and the community to be served at the time they were established. The Deputy will be aware that under the Equal Status Act, schools are not permitted to discriminate in admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act. However the Act contains an exemption which permits schools in which the objective is to provide education that promotes certain religious values, to admit a student of a particular religion in preference to others. </p><p>I published the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in early April of this year.  While no amendment to the Equal Status Act has been included in the published Admission to Schools Bill I have since made clear my view that the Equal Status Act must be amended so that all schools are required to prioritise local children, regardless of their religion while building in protection for the small number of minority faith schools which serve dispersed communities.This is a matter that needs to be addressed as a priority for the next Government so that it can be dealt with in advance of the next school year.</p></reply>

The Paris agreement should provide an enabling platform for all Parties to pursue low-carbon, climate-resilient sustainable development taking account of national circumstances and changes in those circumstances over time. The Agreement and supporting decisions should put the world on a collective pathway to limit the average global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. An ambitious agreement is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests &ndash; firstly, it will protect us from the impacts of climate change; secondly, it will allow us to pursue transition to a low-carbon future on a level playing field with other countries; and finally,   some of Ireland&rsquo;s key partner countries from a development perspective are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. </p>  <p>The current negotiations are challenging for all countries and compromises will be required. It will be more important than ever to demonstrate the ability of Governments to work together to solve global problems and to meet challenges in a spirit of co-operation. The agreement therefore should be fit for purpose in terms of setting out a clear direction of travel for the long term , inclusive of core rules regarding participation and transparency.   </p>  <p>Ireland&rsquo;s target under the new agreement will be part of the already tabled EU target of an at least 40% reduction in domestic greenhouse gas emissions compared to 199 0 by 2030, as agreed by the European Council in October 2014. No new targets will be agreed for Ireland in Paris &ndash; this will be discussed by EU Member States in 2016 in terms of the effort sharing process to be agreed at EU level.   </p>  <p>The outcome of the Conference will need to send a strong signal to all actors that Governments are committed to supporting the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. The Taoiseach underlined Ireland&rsquo;s specific commitment in this respect, when delivering our National Statement at COP 21   last week.</p></reply>

To the end of September 2015, a total of 1,600 NAMA residential properties had been delivered for social housing use, comprising 1,241 completed properties and a further 359 that have been contracted and where completion work is on-going. A further 486 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal is being carried out. An additional 440 properties are to be further appraised. Overall, I expect that in excess of 2,000 units will be secured for social housing purposes from this engagement with NAMA.</p><p>In addition, NAMA is funding the construction of new residential properties to help meet demand in the major urban centres. The overall programme will be funded from NAMA&rsquo;s own resources and will lead to the development of an estimated 20,000 units by 2020, mainly in the Greater Dublin area where the current residential supply shortage is most acute. Residential developments funded by NAMA are subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments and this includes policy relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.As such, I expect 10% of the output of this investment by NAMA, or about 2,000 units,to become available for social housing. </p><p>NAMA sourced units are brought into social housing use through existing delivery mechanisms including the Social Housing Investment Programme, the Capital Acquisition Scheme and the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). The mechanism utilised is, and will continue to be considered, taking issues such as value for money, the availability of Capital Funding and project specific details into account.</p><p>NAMA&rsquo;s Special Purpose Vehicle - the &lsquo;National Asset Residential Property Services&rsquo; (NARPS) &ndash; was established in 2013 to facilitate the sale or lease of NAMA debtor or receiver residential properties for social housing purposes. In line with a commitment in the Social Housing Strategy  , its remit has been expanded to allow it to fund the purchase of Part V units which become available through NAMA&rsquo;s residential delivery programme. In this way, NAMA will continue to facilitate the provision of high quality units for social housing purposes in mixed tenure, sustainable communities and thus complement the extensive social housing construction programmes of local authorities also currently underway. </p><p>At the end of September 2015, 858 or 48% of the social housing units delivered by NAMA were by way of long term leasing funded by the SHCEP. I expect by year end, this will be well in excess of 50%. The current average monthly cost of operational NAMA units leased by Approved Housing Bodies or local authorities, and funded by SHCEP, is &euro;770 per unit per month. Monthly leasing arrangements under the SHCEP achieve significant discounts on market rents and are subject to regular rent reviews. In the case of NAMA related properties, average discounts achieved are in the region of 17% for houses and 12% for apartments. In addition, under these arrangements, rents are fixed for the first six years. </p><p>In the case of properties purchased, my Department does not distinguish the financing of NAMA sourced units from other sources of social housing supply. In every case, prices paid are determined by the independently determined market value.</p><p>Information on NAMA social housing programme is available on the website of the Housing Agency at <i>/NAMA.</i></p></reply>

The Station is owned and operated by the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG). It provides unique data on atmospheric change including data on the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is associated with climate change.  The Station provides a range of scientific reports which are among the most cited in this area of science. It also supplies on-going data on levels of air pollutants to the National Ambient Air Quality Network operated by the Environmental Protection Agency and other national and European agencies.      </p>  <p>Due to its strategic location and importance the Mace Head Research facility has received considerable amounts of research funding from national, EU, US and other sources.  Support for the work of the Station has been provided by the State to NUIG through the funding of research projects and the provision of scientific support for activities at the site, in particular by the EPA, but also by other national research funding bodies.  My Department does not provide direct funding to NUIG for the operation of the Station.</p></reply>

To the end of September 2015, a total of 1,600 NAMA residential properties had been delivered for social housing use, comprising 1,241 completed properties and a further 359 that have been contracted and where completion work is on-going. A further 486 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going. An additional 440 properties are to be further appraised. Overall, I expect that initiative will result in over 2,000 units being made available for social housing purposes.  In addition, NAMA expects to fund the construction of up to 20,000 new residential units, predominantly in Dublin and the neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath, over the next five years.  This will In line with residential planning and regulatory requirements, developments funded by NAMA are subject to policy relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. As such, I expect 10% of the output of this investment by NAMA, or about 2,000 units, to become available for social housing.</p><p>Given the vital importance of ensuring that, for social and economic reasons, new residential supply is delivered as quickly as possible, NAMA will work closely with local authorities and with utilities to ensure that all relevant bodies co-operate effectively to deliver the programme.</p><p>Information on NAMA social housing programme is available on the website of the Housing Agency at <i>/NAMA</i>.</p></reply>

The Regulations prescribed a common application form to be used by all housing authorities. The information sought in the form reflects the eligibility and need criteria set down in the housing legislation which must be met by an applicant.  To ensure that a housing authority is in a position to consider a household&rsquo;s application properly and fairly, this form must be completed fully and all relevant supporting documentation supplied. Failure to provide full information could result in an inaccurate assessment of the household&rsquo;s application, including an unwarranted negative decision regarding qualification.   </p>  <p>  Regulation 12 of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribes the timescales for the processing of applications by housing authorities for social housing support. In order for an application to be processed by a housing authority, the application form must be fully completed and any necessary additional information submitted by the applicant within the prescribed timescale. </p>  <p>  In general, a housing authority should not take more than 12 weeks from the time of a valid application to complete its assessment. However, different timescales may apply where the housing authority requires additional information from the applicant within the relevant period, as defined in the Regulations. This process can lead to possible extensions to the 12 week timeline. </p>  <p>The assessment of applications for social housing support is solely a matter for housing authorities and I would expect that any additional information sought by a local authority would be appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of the household concerned.   </p>  <p>I am satisfied that the current assessment process provides for an open and transparent system for identifying those households in need of social housing support. However, I am mindful of the need to ensure that any such system is not unnecessarily onerous on either applicants or housing authorities, and in the context of the review of social housing assessment procedures currently being undertaken as part of the broader social housing reform agenda outlined in the Social Housing Strategy 2020, the application form is being examined to identify any potential areas for improvement.</p></reply>

The majority of this number, 46,584 (52%), were found to be dependent on rent supplement and were therefore already supported in terms of housing by the State.The results of the 2013 Assessments are based on a comprehensive review of households on housing lists on a set date, which involved local authorities contacting individual households to confirm their continued requirement and qualification for social housing support. </p><p>All households which qualified for social housing support prior to 1 April 2011 were subjected to a full review to ascertain whether they met the new requirements under the 2011 Regulations, while those which qualified after 1 April 2011 were reviewed so as to ensure their continued compliance with the 2011 Regulations.</p><p>The 2013 figure is of course subject to on-going fluctuation due to households being allocated housing and new households applying. To take a snapshot of housing need in any given county, at a point in time in 2015, and compare it to the 2013 data, which was compiled as a result of rigorous analysis, has methodological weaknesses, which would distort the overall picture of need. </p><p>In terms of the Government&rsquo;s overall response, a shortage of supply is at the heart of the current challenges in the housing sector and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 Strategy  , published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting the estimated residential demand of 25,000 units per annum are resolved. My Department and other relevant Government Departments and agencies are actively implementing the range of commitments set out therein. In addition, NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020. 90% of these units will be in the greater Dublin area, with approximately 75% of the units being starter homes. </p><p>With regard to social housing delivery, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 sets out clear, measurable actions to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the social housing list. The Strategy has been supported by two successive budgets with &euro;1.7 billion allocated to housing, with associated delivery targets of over 33,000 units across both Capital and Current programmes. Given the pressing need to recommence a house building programme almost &euro;3 billion in capital funding will be provided in support of the Social Housing Strategy under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan - Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021.</p><p>The unprecedented support and funding being allocated to bring vacant and boarded-up social housing units back into use is a notable example of the Social Housing Strategy&rsquo;s focused and realistic approach. Over 2,300 units were delivered in 2014, and I expect 2,500 units to be completed in 2015. </p><p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy. There are currently more than 5,400 households in receipt of HAP and the scheme has been rolled out to all categories of household in 18 local authority areas. Dublin City Council is also implementing a HAP pilot scheme for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities.</p><p>In recognition of the need for greater flexibility in the challenging Dublin region rental market, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) (No.4) Regulations 2015, which provide for the introduction of HAP in Kildare and Meath County Councils with maximum rent limits equivalent to current Rent Supplement rates applicable in the neighbouring Dublin areas. These regulations also provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum rent limits that apply for the purposes of HAP in the administrative areas of Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Galway County Council, Kildare County Council and Meath County Council, where this is necessary to source suitable accommodation for a household that is qualified for social housing support.</p><p>On 10 November 2015, Government approval was given to a package of measures to address rent stability and housing supply. The measures will act to stabilise rents in the short to medium term while the additional supply of housing comes on stream. In relation to rent stability, the measures were given effect by the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015. This Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period. In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced. </p><p>Details of the full package of new rent stability and housing supply measures are available at the following link:<i>. </i></p><p>Cognisant of the difficulty faced by households in accessing the housing market, Budget 2016 provided for an affordable rental pilot scheme, with &euro;10 million being made available. The Scheme will be an on-going annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions. Details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department and will be completed by end-year, for rollout in early 2016.</p><p>Through these and other actions delivered to date under the Social Housing StrategyMinister Coffey and I have been actively supporting all local authorities to increase the supply of social housing to meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list, with flexibility to meet future demand. Moreover, in order to get the most accurate data relating to the numbers applying for social housing support, the Strategy includes a commitment to undertake social housing assessments on an annual basis from 2016 onwards.</p></reply>

In that period, the number of unfinished housing developments has decreased by approximately two-thirds, from nearly 3,000 in 2010 to 992 in 2014.  The detailed findings of the annual surveys, annual progress reports and other useful publications and information in relation to Unfinished Housing Developments are available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>As Minister for Housing and Planning and Coordination of Construction 2020, I chair the National Coordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments. The Committee has adopted a collaborative approach amongst its constituent members to promote the work of resolving the housing situation faced by residents of unfinished housing developments. </p><p>The Government has taken a number of significant steps to address the issue of Unfinished Housing Developments. My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative (PSI) in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. Under the PSI, there were a total of 144 claims in respect of 23 local authorities which resulted in &euro;3.628 million being drawdown. </p><p>To assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments, Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF). The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. The SRF was particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax exemption, as in a seriously problematic condition. </p><p>On 2 May 2014, SRF allocations to 86 housing developments across the country were announced. Further information is available at the following weblink:<i></i></p><p>This public investment aimed to leverage an additional &euro;12m from third parties (developers/lenders/bonds) which will be invested in these estates. The SRF has enabled very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.</p><p>The 2015 National Housing Development Survey and the Annual Progress Report are due for completion shortly and I will be publishing the results.  I am confident that good progress is continuing to be made in resolving unfinished developments and the reactivation of sites is now evident throughout the country. </p></reply>

To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on sites which are included in the local authority&rsquo;s derelict sites register, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict   site. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas. </p>  <p>Derelict sites throughout the State, particularly in urban areas, continue to remain a focus for my Department, and whereas the administration of the legislation at local level is a matter for the relevant local authority, my Department updates, on an annual basis, a Schedule of Urban Areas designated by local authorities as areas in which the derelict site levy can be applied in line with the provisions of the Act. The latest update of this Schedule (for 2015) is nearing completion. </p>  <p>The recently enacted Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 introduced a new measure, the vacant site levy, which is aimed at incentivising the development and use of vacant, underutilised sites in urban areas . When it becomes operational from 2019 onwards, it is envisaged that the levy will be instrumental in bringing vacant, underutilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes. To avoid a double levy situation in the case of any individual site, the Act provides that the derelict site levy shall not be payable in respect of any land on which the vacant site levy will be payable.   </p>  <p>Town and village renewal is being supported on an on-going basis by the suite of measures introduced by the Government as set out in   the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s recent Parliamentary Question No. 235 of 5 November 2015 on the matter, and in my more recent reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s Topical Interest Debate motion on 11 November 2015.</p></reply>

This subvention is paid directly to the air carrier, Stobart Air. <table><tr><th>CAPEX(Capital Grants) </th><th>2014<br /><br />&euro;,000 </th><th>2013<br /><br />&euro;,000 </th><th>2012  <br /><br />&euro;,000 </th><th>2011<br /><br />&euro;,000 </th></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>432</td><td>339</td><td>0</td><td>2,111</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>222</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>133</td><td>741</td><td>1,634</td><td>399</td></tr><tr><td>Knock</td><td>1,925</td><td>2,013</td><td>699</td><td>233</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>238</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>533</td><td>362</td><td>1,334</td><td>796</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>3,023 </td><td>3,455 </td><td>3,667 </td><td>3,999 </td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>OPEX (Operational Expenditure Support) </th><th>2014<br /><br />&euro;,000 </th><th>2013<br /><br />&euro;,000 </th><th>2012<br /><br />&euro;,000 </th><th>2011<br /><br />&euro;,000 </th></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>111 </td><td>42 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>2,309 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>507 </td><td>437 </td><td>550 </td><td>950 </td></tr><tr><td>Knock</td><td>549 </td><td>654 </td><td>590 </td><td>432 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>387 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>1,038 </td><td>1,121 </td><td>1,233 </td><td>1272 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>2,094 </td><td>2,212 </td><td>2,484 </td><td>5,392 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.   Ireland has just under 100,000 kilometres of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  Because of the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads over the past number of years. Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;760 million for the national, regional and local road network.  The reality is that funding will continue to be tight for the next number of years.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are aware that it is a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and to allocate funding accordingly.  Given funding constraints, my objective has to be to allocate funding to local authorities on as equitable basis as possible.  The main grant categories are, therefore, based on road lengths in each local authority's area of responsibility.  </p>  <p>  The RLR allocations for next year have yet to be decided but I expect to announce the details early next year. It is important to reiterate that State grants are intended to supplement local authorities' own resources.  In this context, I am emphasising to Councils that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources, towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential.</p></reply>
