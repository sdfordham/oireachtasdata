    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-22a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112200047#WRA00600"><p>The Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working, which was promulgated in 2006, already contains provisions relating to the provision of additional hours of work to employees.  The Code was prepared by the Labour Relations Commission in line with Section 13(5) of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.  The provisions in the 2001 Act had implemented an EU Directive, which itself was based on a Framework Agreement of the European Social Partners.  The Framework Agreement on part-time work aimed to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of both employers and employees.  </p><p>  The Code of Practice contains provisions both in relation to transferring from full-time work to part-time work and from part-time work to full-time work.  One of the basic principles referred to in paragraph 4 of the Code is that, as far as possible, employers should give consideration to requests by employees to transfer from part-time to full-time work, or to increase their working time should the opportunity arise.  In addition, paragraph 8 of the Code includes a reference to the transfer from part-time to full-time work.  I am satisfied that the Code of Practice encourages flexibility and responds to requests from employees to move from part-time towards full-time employment, or vice versa.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-22a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112200047#WRA00800"><p>The most recent official figures from the CSO are for the year ended April 2012. Emigration from Ireland in the twelve months to April 2012 is estimated to have increased to 87,100 from 80,600 in the year to April 2011, while the number of immigrants is estimated to have fallen marginally to 52,700 from 53,300 over the same period. The combined effect of natural increase and negative net migration resulted in an overall small increase in the population of 10,500 bringing the population estimate to 4.59 million in April 2012.</p><p>  These figures indicate that net emigration (emigration less immigration) of 34,400 took place in this period.  This compares with a figure of 27,400 in the previous year, before the present government took office.</p><p>   The impact of migration on the size of the labour force depends on a range of factors including, for example, the age at which people migrate and whether they are of working age.</p><p>  Allowing for these factors, it is estimated that the impact of migration in the year ended April 2012 was to reduce the size of the labour force by between 20,000 and 25,000 below the level it would have reached in the absence of migration. </p><p>  The Government is tackling unemployment and the stabilisation of the employment rate through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, which are together complemented by measures to ensure individuals are appropriately educated and trained to be able to avail of those job opportunities.  The aim of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of <i>Pathways to Work</i> is to provide those who are unemployed with the appropriate training and skills to avail of the job opportunities which will arise as the economy recovers. </p><p>  The Government is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placements, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries in 2012, including through the JobBridge internship programme. These and other measures have been devised to enable young people to get access to a first job - although they are not restricted to young people but can also assist those who have become unemployed and are at risk of becoming long term unemployed. </p><p>  Measures to combat unemployment also include general supports for self-employment/small business start-up &#8211; such as the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, entrepreneurship training, and advisory and financial support through local County Enterprise Boards. Many young people will benefit from these opportunities. In addition, over 450,000 education and training places will be provided in the higher education, further education and training sectors. These places will include provision for school leavers, although the long-term unemployed are a priority target.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-22a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112200047#WRA01000"><p>The State has a significant body of employment rights legislation designed to protect workers. There is no distinction made under this legislation between workers on grounds as to whether or not they are classified as European Economic Area workers or migrant workers. </p><p>  The State provides a number of mechanisms through which these statutory employment rights can be vindicated and enforced.  </p><p>  NERA seeks to secure compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary.  NERA inspectors are authorised officers under the Employment Permits Acts and compliance checks under this legislation are an integral element of all NERA inspections. Where people have concerns that workers may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation. </p><p>  In other cases complaints may be made to the Rights Commissioner Service, the EAT, the Equality Tribunal or the Labour Court depending on the nature of the complaint and the relevant legislation.</p><p>  It has to be acknowledged that the system that has developed over the years has become complex and in some cases involves long delays. However, I have commenced a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I am happy to report that significant progress has been made to date in that regard.  In addition to reforming the structures and processes, I also intend to provide for enhanced compliance measures and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the Adjudicators and of Labour Court Determinations.</p><p>  The mechanisms I have outlined above relate to people who are legally entitled to work in the state.  A situation where an individual, whose immigration status prohibits him or her from working legally in the State, takes up employment and is thus working illegally is different.  In such cases both the employer and the employee may be committing an offence.</p><p>  In this regard, I am mindful of the issue raised recently by the High Court in its judgement concerning the Employment Permits Acts 2003, and 2006 which found that an employee may not rely on the contract of employment in the absence of an employment permit where one was required. The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such workers should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. This question requires very careful consideration.</p><p>  It is my intention to amend the Employment Permits legislation in a precise manner so as to ensure that an employer may not benefit from the illegality of the contract of employment where they are found culpable in not ensuring a valid employment permit was in place for the employee concerned.  To this end, it is my intention that this amendment will be proposed in a new Employment Permits Bill which is currently being drafted and which I anticipate introducing in the first quarter of next year. I believe that this would be the most appropriate method of dealing with such a technically specific matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-22a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112200047#WRA01200"><p>In October 2011, I launched a &euro;10 million International Start-Up Fund aimed at encouraging overseas entrepreneurs to locate start-up businesses in Ireland. The Fund, which is administered by Enterprise Ireland, targets investor-ready projects seeking financial support of between &euro;200,000 and &euro;500,000. Funding is in the form of an equity stake taken by the State in the company.</p><p>  Stimulating the flow of new High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) and supporting their growth are fundamental building blocks in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for economic growth and job creation.  Our domestic entrepreneurs have been and continue to be an excellent source of innovative new businesses in various sectors across the country. However, the attraction of overseas-originated start-ups to Ireland is an additional opportunity to expand our HPSU activity. Overseas entrepreneurs will significantly add to the diversity and skill-base of the Irish start up community.</p><p>  Since the launch of the fund, over 450 enquiries (at varying stages of development) have been received by Enterprise Ireland in relation to support for inward entrepreneurial start-ups. The rate of enquiries has grown steadily as the promotional campaign has progressed and is now running at approximately 40 per month. As investor-ready projects are identified and developed, extensive engagement with the promoters including all appropriate due diligence is undertaken. Projects are then considered by an Enterprise Ireland approval committee. To date, 13 projects have been considered and approved funding by Enterprise Ireland, of which 12 projects are currently being advanced and will likely draw down funds. These 12 projects have been approved funds totalling approximately &euro;2.9m. </p><p>  Many of these projects are at the initial stage of ramping up activity and building out their employment. Typically, High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) are supported on the basis that they have the potential to grow to ten or more jobs within a three-year timeframe.</p><p>  It is anticipated that the overseas entrepreneurs supported to date will demonstrate job creation potential in excess of this benchmark over the next number of years. Additionally, the promotional campaign which has been underway has served to build a strong pipeline of prospective projects, and conversion of these opportunities will be a priority for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-22a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112200048#WRB00500"><p>There is a series of actions included in the Action Plan for Jobs aimed at implementing the commitment in the Programme for Government to improve access to public procurement for SMEs.  These include ensuring that the qualifying criteria for public contracts are proportionate, and providing advice to firms on how to improve their engagement in the procurement process.  Some of these actions are for delivery by the National Procurement Service (NPS) and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which has overall responsibility for public procurement policy in Ireland.</p><p>  With regard to my own Department and its agencies, Enterprise Ireland is actively supporting its client companies in preparing and competing for public contracts.  The agency has assigned 18 Advisors to work with companies in the procurement process.  This support is in addition to the one-to-one engagement undertaken with client companies by Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Procurement Team. In the last 12 months, 697 clients have participated in events organised by the Public Procurement Team.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, along with the NPS, has been encouraging client SMEs to register on the eTenders.ie and Procurement.ie websites so that they are alerted to upcoming public procurement opportunities.  The agency has also been involved in &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo; events which bring together public sector buyers and potential suppliers.  The Minister for Small Business, Deputy John Perry, addressed the most recent event in Kilkenny earlier this month.  Over 500 suppliers met with a range of public sector buyers on the day, including the Health Service Executive, Dublin Airport Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Central Procurement Directorate, National Procurement Service, and Vocational Education Committees (VECs).</p><p>  A &lsquo;Procuring Innovation Initiative&rsquo; has also been introduced under the Action Plan for Jobs, with the aim of encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering that focuses on procuring innovative solutions to an organisation&rsquo;s needs, rather than prescribed products or services which may be less effective.  This approach will afford an opportunity for innovate SMEs to demonstrate their capacity to win public contracts. Following a Roundtable which I hosted earlier this year, a number of State bodies have agreed to participate in the Procuring Innovation Initiative.  The objective is that the projects pursued by these bodies will act as exemplars for the expansion of the initiative in 2013.</p><p>  In conjunction with the NPS, Enterprise Ireland is also exploring the potential for developing a panel of sub-contractors on the Government&rsquo;s eTenders website which could be available to principal contractors who are looking for subcontractors or specialist partners to complete a project.</p><p>  Progress in relation to the various initiatives under the Action Plan for Jobs to improve SME access to public procurement are published in the Quarterly Progress Reports which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.enterprise.gov.ie.</p></reply>

The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to create a supportive environment for enterprise to create and sustain new jobs, while the aim of Pathways to Work is ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to people who are currently on the Live Register, particularly those who are Long Term Unemployed.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 individual actions to be delivered in 2012, spanning all Government Departments and 36 State agencies. The third Progress Report on the Action Plan was published on 17th October 2012.  It shows that 218 (96%) of the 227 milestones to be achieved in the first three Quarters of 2012 had been delivered.</p><p>  The full impact of the measures being taken under the Action Plan for Jobs will become apparent over time, but we are already seeing encouraging progress.  For example, so far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 8,500 further jobs as these projects come on stream.  In the first eight months of this year, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, were secured.</p><p>  Employment in the Tourism sector increased by 6,300 over the period June 2011 to June 2012.  There were also modest increases in Agri-food and ICT, while the number of people employed in Digital Games has also doubled since 2009.  These are sectors specifically targeted for support under the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways to Work include over 85,000 job placement and work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  Pathways to Work has an objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months, to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection recently launched a new a new employment and support service &ndash; Intreo. This will provide individualised supports to jobseekers to assist them in getting back to work and increasing their employability.</p><p>  In addition, there is a range of other measures available to those who are on the Live Register and seeking to start their own business, such as supports from the County and City Enterprise Boards, the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance and the new Micro Finance Fund.  There are also financial supports available to employers who recruit a person who is long term unemployed, including Revenue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Job Assist&rdquo; scheme and the Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Exemption scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  The Government has been actively promoting these schemes to employers in recent months, with the support of business representative bodies.</p><p>  We will continue to do all we can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs.  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and in that context, will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-22a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112200048#WRB00900"><p>The Government decision to abolish the separate Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) is part of the wider reform and efficiency process currently being driven right across the public sector. The abolition of the Office of the CSA is one element of a number of reforms being driven by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  The principal function of the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government when it was established in 2004 was to provide high-level advice on scientific issues of concern to Government and to provide scientific inputs to the development of Science Technology and Innovation (STI) strategy including through the Inter-Departmental Committee on STI or through the Advisory Science Council.</p><p>  Since its establishment the role of CSA evolved into one which was more ambassadorial and representational in nature and this proved highly beneficial to our international reputation and standing &ndash; e.g. in securing European Science Open Forum for Dublin this year.</p><p>  In reality over the past 8 years there has been little requirement for the CSA to respond to formal requests from Government for advice on specific scientific issues of concern.</p><p>  With regard to the CSA advisory role, no individual could be expected to be a leading expert on the full range of scientific issues that might arise across the spectrum of Government activities such as in relation to public health, veterinary science, energy etc.</p><p>  This is borne out by the experience to date where the Government continues to utilise for the most part the specialist expertise in these fields that is available within Departments. In the event that the advice of the CSA is required, the role of the CSA in such circumstances would be to identify and source the best possible scientific advice for Government.</p><p>  It is considered that the Director General of SFI, Prof. Mark Ferguson, given his eminent scientific background, extensive industry expertise and a range of global contacts, and as the head of the Government&rsquo;s leading science agency, is optimally placed to secure that independent advice.</p><p>  Prof Ferguson has agreed to take on the additional duties of CSA without any additional remuneration or any additional resources.</p><p>  Prof Ferguson will, where the need arises, utilise a panel of independent experts, in an arrangement similar to some other international systems.</p></reply>

The system that developed over the last sixty years had become unwieldy and complex; it lacked consistency, involved long delays and in some cases proved expensive for users.</p><p>  In short, the system was no longer fit for purpose and it was for this reason that I have commenced a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.</p><p>  Significant progress has been made to date and I am happy to report that in the last year a number of priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale.</p><p>  While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation in order to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes.</p><p>  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill which will give statutory effect to the Reform proposals.  In July 2012, I published a policy document &#8211; <i>Legislating for a World Class Workplace Relations Service</i>   - which was submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to give the Committee an early opportunity to shape the legislation.  I had a constructive dialogue with the Committee on the basis of this document.</p><p>  Enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary acts, 12 specified parts or sections of acts and 71 statutory instruments.  The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting.  Engagement is on-going with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and   I expect publication at an early stage next year.  This would enable the proposed new structures to be put in place by early 2013.</p><p>  I intend to progress the reform programme to the next stage with the same determination that has delivered the achievements to date.  I am working towards delivery of the new two-tier Workplace Relations structure so that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.</p><p>  In the meantime I intend to continue to progress the reform and bring about further enhancements for users of the services on an administrative basis in the coming months. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-22a.35.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012112200048#WRB01300"><p>I welcome the Report of Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, &lsquo;A review of the Information Communication Technology (ICT) skills demand in Ireland&rsquo; and look forward to meeting with the Committee shortly to discuss its findings.</p><p>  Ireland has to compete with other countries for migrant labour, particularly in respect of high-level skills. Skills required in the high-tech sectors are in demand and in short supply globally. While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, there continues to be a need to supplement Ireland&rsquo;s skills stock through employment permits and to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s employment permits system is geared towards attracting such skills.</p><p>  Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills and labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as health care, information technology and financial services.</p><p>  The employment permits regime is supporting the enterprise sector and significant levels of applications are successful particularly those based on high skills levels. My Department&rsquo;s figures indicate:</p><p>- A reduction in total applications in line with economic circumstances, but an increase in Green Card applications, in line with a greater emphasis on high value skills; - An increase in the proportion of applications in respect of ICT job roles with applications in respect of ICT job roles being more successful than the norm. Over 90% of ICT related applications are successful and over 1,200 ICT related applications have been approved so far this year.</p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the implementation of policy in relation to the admission of non-EEA nationals to the State and their residence in the State.  There can be some confusion with regard to the term &lsquo;IT Visa&rsquo; as it is suggestive of a visa-based immigration system. However, the employment permit regime provides for a managed system regarding entry to Ireland&rsquo;s labour market as well as powers for enforcement of employment rights.  Economic migrants are a vulnerable class of people. Any actions affecting inward economic migration should be cognisant of the need to ensure that such migrants are protected and made aware of their employment rights.</p><p>  Therefore, we should examine how the employment permits regime can be adjusted in order to facilitate attracting highly sought skills. Even further, we should facilitate all highly sought skills, not just those relating to the ICT sector.</p><p>  My Department has reviewed its processes with a view to attracting more ICT related applications and other applications regarding highly sought skills and is confident that significant improvements can be made shortly which will greatly enhance the employment permits regime, for example:</p><p>- In conjunction with Forf&aacute;s, a review is underway of the Green Card Employment Permit Scheme which is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.</p><p>- An interim review of the four core employment permit types - Green Cards, Intra-Company Transfers, Work Permits and Spousal/Dependents - has identified a variety of means to improving the throughput and quality of employment permit applications. Such an initiative would favour the ICT sector in particular as it would include a streamlining of the documentary process, a reduction in the time it takes for applicants to prepare a successful application, and a significant reduction in processing times. </p><p>- Closer interactions are being cultivated with the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to providing a more coherent service across the employment permit regime and visa regime including policy convergence, greater information sharing and unified communications from both Departments in respect of labour market access.</p><p>  I intend to announce a range of improvements in this regard shortly.</p><p>  It is also the Government&rsquo;s ambition that Ireland should take advantage of the opportunities for employment in the ICT sector and that every opportunity is afforded to our graduates and unemployed to prepare them with the skills required to work in that sector. Employment permits are but one way of increasing the level of ICT skills available in the labour market and I am mindful that improvements in the regime must be done in a manner that does not undermine the work of my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills to increase domestic supply through our education system and targeting of the unemployed.  In that regard, the Minister for Education and Skills has already put in place plans to establish an overarching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018.  These plans involve actions to:</p><p>- increase the domestic supply of honours degree graduates in the short term through expansion of conversion; and </p><p>- boost the longer term supply and quality of graduates from the higher education system.</p><p>  Finally, work is also proceeding in my Department with regard to the preparation of new employment permits legislation which will provide for more flexibility and targeted instruments in support of the economy&rsquo;s evolving skills needs. Heads of Bill were approved by Government last April and since then, my Department has been engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in order to progress the drafting of the Bill.</p></reply>

To this effect, there is on-going dialogue between relevant Ministers and officials, North and South, to promote economic development, job creation and innovation, in the border region.</p><p>  From my own perspective, I attend meetings in the Trade and Business development sectoral format of the North South Ministerial Council, which are held twice a year.  I also attend two meetings each year of the North South Plenary which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers. At these meetings there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, particularly at the sectoral meetings, where I have direct discussions with my NI counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on a wide range of issues of mutual interest. I look forward to meeting Minister Foster again at the next Trade and Business Development meeting scheduled to be held next week.</p><p>  My officials engage in on-going dialogue with their counterparts in DETI. A key area of such regular engagement is on the operation of InterTrade  Ireland, the North/South Trade and Business Development Implementation Body, which is co-funded by my Department and DETI. All matters relating to the management of that body and the planning and oversight of its schemes and programmes, involve close interaction by the officials of both Departments.</p><p>  Another key area of engagement at official level between my Department and DETI is our joint support for enterprise projects under the Interreg initiative, which is co-funded by the EU, by my Department and by DETI. The most recent of these involves the establishment of a significant North West Science Park, to be co-located in Derry and Letterkenny, in respect of which both our Departments have agreed financial support.  The process of assessing further Interreg projects for joint funding is on-going and both groups of officials are also engaged in a process which will hopefully see a new Interreg Scheme initiated when the current phase expires in 2014.</p><p>  In addition to direct Departmental engagement, there is a long history of co-operative action between North/South enterprise agencies to achieve mutual benefits. Enterprise Ireland, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes to drive job creation in border areas.  IDA Ireland collaborates with Invest Northern Ireland, for example, in the <i>Northwest Now</i>   initiative. More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on science and technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.</p><p>  My Department, along with our enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with our counterpart Department and relevant Northern Ireland Agencies to increase the economic benefits, especially on job creation research and innovation, accruing from practical co-operation.</p></reply>

The scheme falls within the responsibility of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.</p><p>  The objective of JobBridge is to help those seeking employment to gain valuable work experience and enhance their prospects of securing employment.  It is just one element of the Department of Social Protection's wider activation programme, under the Pathways to Work strategy.</p><p>  JobBridge is overseen by a Steering Group chaired by Martin Murphy, CEO of Hewlett Packard, and involving a range of stakeholders.  My Department is represented on the Steering Group and has been an active participant since the Group was established in May of last year.</p><p>  A total of 5,000 places were provided for JobBridge on a rolling basis when it was launched in July 2011.  A recent interim evaluation of the scheme by Indecon shows that more than half of the participants found employment following their participation on JobBridge.  This evaluation confirmed the picture that had been emerging for the Steering Group on the basis of data on uptake and outcomes of the scheme.</p><p>  Given the success of the scheme since its inception, Minister Burton announced an increase of 1,000 additional places on the scheme on 9th May last.  This brings the total number of places available to 6,000.  As of 15th November, there were 5,395 interns participating on the scheme, with a further 1,173 going through the approval process within the Department of Social Protection.  There are currently 1,852 internship posts being advertised by host companies for applications from prospective interns, which are spread throughout the country.</p><p>  Consideration of any further increases in the number of internship places available under the scheme is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

For example, fuel and energy prices are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government&rsquo;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.  These include:</p><p>-	reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms;</p><p>-	reducing the administrative burden on business;</p><p>-	placing downward pressure on insurance costs through the enactment of the Legal Services Bill;</p><p>-	encouraging all professionals to supply quotes in advance to business customers;</p><p>-	providing supports to businesses to improve their energy and resource costs;</p><p>-	introducing a mechanism to allow small companies to apply to the Circuit Court, rather that the High Court, to have an Examiner appointed;</p><p>-	encouraging local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates.</p><p>  Updates on these, and all other commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, are detailed in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Plan which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.enterprise.gov.ie.</p><p>  The most recent report published by the National Competitiveness Council (NCC), in July of this year - &ldquo;Ireland's Competitiveness Scorecard&rdquo; - acknowledged that improvements have taken place in Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs.  However, the NCC also advised that Ireland must maintain focus and continue to reduce costs to business.</p><p>  Further measures to achieve the structural reforms identified by the NCC to improve our competitiveness will be contained in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which I am currently preparing in consultation with my Government colleagues.</p></reply>

Ireland is a successful major centre for ICT operations with nine of the top ten software companies in the world having substantial operations here. There are approximately 82,300 staff employed in the sector. Over the last year, there has been a 5% employment growth for companies engaged within computer programming, computer facilities management, ICT consultancy and ICT services activities. Employment within computer and electronic equipment manufacturing has also stabilised following an 18% decline over 2006-2009.  Finally, the ICT sector accounts for 35% of total annual exports sales. This amounts to &#8364;60bn &#8211; of which &#8364;50bn is ICT software and ICT services and &#8364;10bn is ICT electronics, hardware and communications.</p><p>  We all recognise that ICT, as a sector, will only grow in importance across the world. Ireland is not faced with making a choice between attracting ICT skills from abroad or developing ICT skills through its training and education systems. It can do both. It is certain that the ICT sector provides ample opportunity for Ireland and that there is likely to be excellent opportunities for ICT and other Science related graduates into the future. New ICT inward investments in Ireland are testimony to company confidence in Ireland as a strategic business location for a broad range of international activities. Ireland's inward investment proposition includes an availability of top quality talent and its technology base, as well as 12.5% corporation tax rate, 25% R&amp;D tax credit and EU / Euro membership. The supply of high-level ICT skills is important in terms of meeting current demand and driving future demand, supporting new business growth and inward investment.</p><p>  An increasing share of employment within the sector is being accounted for by people with high-level ICT skills. However, recruitment challenges have emerged and it is estimated that there are in excess of 1,500 job vacancies in the ICT sector.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) in its report <i>&#8220;Addressing High&#8211;Level ICT Skills Recruitment Needs&#8221;</i>   (January 2012) has identified immediate skills needs at 8+ years&#8217; experience and that while the recruitment of such experienced ICT professionals is smaller in number, it is linked to the additional hiring of a team of graduate and professional staff.</p><p>  If the skills supply were available there is the potential for foreign companies to win more mobile investment within their group and for Irish companies to keep more of the work here rather than contract it out to their overseas offices, or outsource to third parties overseas.</p><p>  Companies have indicated the need to plan five years out for the building up of the high&#8211;level ICT skills supply, both in terms of quantity and quality. While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, there continues to be a need to supplement Ireland&#8217;s skills stock through employment permits. Skills required in the high-tech sectors are in demand and in short supply globally and so Ireland has to compete with other countries for migrant labour, particularly in respect of high-level skills. One way is to ensure that Ireland&#8217;s employment permits system is geared towards attracting such skills.</p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the implementation of policy in relation to the admission of non-EEA nationals to the State and their residence in the State.  There can be some confusion with regard to the term &#8216;IT Visa&#8217; as it is suggestive of a visa-based immigration system. However, the employment permit regime provides for a managed system regarding entry to Ireland&#8217;s labour market as well as powers for enforcement of employment rights.  Deputies will be only too aware that economic migrants are a vulnerable class of people. Any actions affecting inward economic migration should be cognisant of the need to ensure that such migrants are protected and made aware of their employment rights.</p><p>  The employment permits regime is supporting the enterprise sector and significant levels of applications are successful particularly those based on high skills levels. My Department&#8217;s figures indicate:</p><p>- A reduction in total applications in line with economic circumstances, but an increase in Green Card applications, in line with a greater emphasis on high value skills;</p><p>- An increase in the proportion of applications in respect of ICT job roles with applications in respect of ICT job roles being more successful than the norm. Over 90% of ICT related applications are successful and over 1,200 ICT related applications have been approved so far this year.</p><p>  Therefore, we should examine how the employment permits regime can be adjusted in order to facilitate attracting highly sought skills. My Department has reviewed its processes with a view to attracting more ICT related applications and is confident that significant improvements can be made shortly which will greatly enhance the employment permits regime to ensure growth is not hampered by skills shortages. Furthermore, the improvements will be of benefit to all companies, ranging from indigenous start-ups to large multinationals, in need of ICT skilled labour. The improvements will result in a more streamlined process and reduced waiting times.</p><p>  It is also the Government&#8217;s ambition that Ireland should take advantage of the opportunities for employment in the ICT sector and that every opportunity is afforded to our graduates and unemployed to prepare them with the skills required to work in that sector. Employment permits are but one way of increasing the level of ICT skills available in the labour market and I am mindful that improvements in the regime must be done in a manner that does not undermine the work of my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills to increase domestic supply through our education system and targeting of the unemployed.  In that regard, the Minister has already put in place plans to establish an overarching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018.  These plans involve actions to:</p><p>- increase the domestic supply of honours degree graduates in the short term through expansion of conversion; and</p><p>- boost the longer term supply and quality of graduates from the higher education system.</p><p>  Finally, work is also proceeding in my Department with regard to the preparation of new employment permits legislation which will provide for more flexibility and targeted instruments in support of the economy&#8217;s evolving skills needs. Heads of Bill were approved by Government last April and since then, my Department has been engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in order to progress the drafting of the Bill.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.</p><p>  The Enterprise Development agencies are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and continue to ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic recovery and jobs growth. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy document, entitled &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo;, sets out the Agency&rsquo;s targets for the period 2010 to 2014. These targets include the creation of 63,000 new jobs in Ireland during that period and a target of securing 50% of these investments to locations outside of Dublin and Cork. The agency has invested heavily in the provision of property solutions tailored to meet the requirements of investors and has developed a network of high-quality Business Parks in locations throughout the Midlands and Western Regions. There are a total of 120 IDA supported companies employing over 17,500 people between both regions reflecting the considerable success that has been achieved in attracting high quality investment to both regions.</p><p>  A total of nearly &euro;15m was paid to Enterprise Ireland client companies in the Midland and Western Regions in 2011, supporting more than 18,000 jobs. Of the 92 High Potential Start-ups assisted by Enterprise Ireland throughout the country in 2011, four are based in the Midlands region and eight in the West.  As part of our support for early stage entrepreneurs, I announced an investment of &euro;50,000 by Enterprise Ireland in each of four start-up companies in the West Region on 25 September 2012.</p><p>  An Taoiseach announced a &euro;200,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund for the West Region in September and a &euro;200,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund for the Midlands Region in October 2012.  Support of up to 50% of eligible expenditure up to &euro;25,000 per project is available for entrepreneurs and early-stage companies in each Region.  22 applicants for CFF West have been invited to pitch to a panel of Industry Experts and Enterprise Ireland staff in November 2012.</p><p>  Following Exporting Awareness Events last March and May in Athlone and Galway respectively, a further 'Get Export Ready' Workshop was held in Athlone in April, in Galway in June and July and an Export Awareness Event in Tullamore in October 2012.  A representative from Enterprise Ireland made a presentation on Exporting at the &lsquo;MeetWest 2012&rsquo; event on 20 and 21 November in Co. Roscommon and was available for one-to-one meetings afterwards.</p><p>  Ireland's National Entrepreneur Programme - The New Frontiers EPP Programme - was launched in March 2012.  This Programme provides a package of supports to help accelerate the development of start-up businesses and is being delivered by GMIT at the Galway and Castlebar Innovation Business Centres in the West and in Athlone Institute of Technology in the Midlands.</p><p>  Community Enterprise Centres located in both regions were approved funding under the Community Enterprise Centre Business Development Funding Programme. This Programme supports funding for the creation of, or maintenance of, a business development function within the enterprise centres concerned.  In April, I officially opened the Boyle Enterprise Centre which has received substantial funding from Enterprise Ireland and Roscommon County Enterprise Board.</p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s plans for jobs and growth.  That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business.  This will include the:</p><p>-	Development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors;</p><p>-	Dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs),  and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI);</p><p>-	Establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies and,</p><p>-	Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.</p><p>  Pending the introduction of these proposed new arrangements, County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) in the Midlands and Western Regions will continue to ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development and engage and work with micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, on an on-going basis with strong referral to sister agencies to progress the needs of the businesses in their respective areas.  So far this year, the CEBs in the Midlands and Western Regions have supported over 130 projects to the amount of &euro;1,180,667.</p></reply>

Ireland is a small open economy which needs to have the export of goods and services at the heart of its economic strategy. In order for our companies to achieve success on the global market they must be innovative in order to acquire and maintain ongoing competitive advantage.</p><p>  I have, through the Action Plan for Jobs, set out an approach which is focused on making economic recovery a reality: by delivering improvements in competitiveness; ensuring companies have access to the finance they need to grow and by prioritising innovation as a key driver of success which will lead to jobs growth.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs emphasises the importance of innovation and the use of technology as core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2012, and seeks to maximise their impact in the coming years.</p><p>  My Department and its agencies are focused on the development and support of internationally trading manufacturing and services firms in Ireland in this regard. Enterprise Ireland (EI) is focussed on the growth of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets and works directly with businesses, and the research and investment communities in Ireland to build sustainable competitive advantage for our economy. EI has a range of initiatives focusing on innovation which support businesses to compete sustainably in international markets, in the areas of Organisational and Management Development, Research and Development, Operations and Production, Finance and Investment, Business Strategy and Start-Up.</p><p>  Manufacturing is the bed-rock on which the growth in Ireland&rsquo;s FDI was founded. Mirroring the rest of our economy, manufacturing is also in transition. Higher technological investment and higher value products are the hallmark of future manufacturing operations in Ireland. In order to catalyse such changes, IDA Ireland, in conjunction with EI, is supporting an industry consortium approach on a range of applied research initiatives under the new Technology Centres programme.</p><p>Additionally, Ireland is now a successful services economy with two-thirds of the workforce engaged in services and we are the 10th highest exporter of services in the world (Source: Services Strategy Group Report, September 2008). Over recent years, services&rsquo; activities have accounted for an increasing level of overall IDA investment and Ireland provides a low-risk, quick start-up, high-performance, knowledge economy for service companies.</p><p>  There are some 130,000 people directly employed in 1,004 IDA client companies and in 2011, the value of the foreign direct investment approvals achieved by the IDA that were research, development and innovation (RD&amp;I) based amounted to &euro;700m. Indeed, some 70% of business expenditure on R&amp;D is accounted for by IDA client companies.</p><p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard published earlier this year shows Ireland retaining its position among those Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems. The scoreboard shows that Ireland has strengths in a number of areas including human resources, open, excellent and attractive research systems, and economic effects, which include employment in knowledge intensive activities and knowledge intensive service exports.</p><p>  Ireland has substantial achievements in science over the past decade. We are now in the top 20 in the world for the quality of our scientific output, and in the top 10 globally in a number of specific areas such Immunology (3rd) and Materials Science (8th). The challenge now is to build on these achievements and take our performance to the next level, and that is what the reforms across our research system are aimed at achieving.</p><p>  The Research Prioritisation Report has identified the areas of greatest potential commercial impact for Ireland. Implementation of the Report's recommendations will see the majority of competitive public research funding being aligned with 14 identified priority areas, where we are most likely to get economic and societal returns, most importantly in the form of jobs.  A key economic goal in the implementation of Research Prioritisation will be a significantly enhanced focus on collaborative research with enterprise and on commercialisation by growing the number of researchers in enterprise and enhancing the flow of researchers between academia and enterprise.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s financial support directly assists entrepreneurs and leverages matching funding from banks and investors.</p><p>  In addition to financial supports, Enterprise Ireland have a broad system which supports entrepreneurs in their efforts to set up internationally focused, innovative companies with significant job creation potential.  These include a range of workshops, seminars and training courses for entrepreneurs designed to aid the development of their business plans, and assist them in the process of getting their companies off the ground.</p><p>In relation to healthcare start-ups specifically, the Government is committed, as outlined in Action 7.2.1 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, to deliver a Health Innovation Hub to drive collaboration between the health system and commercial enterprises leading to the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies, products, services and start‐ups emerging from within the health system and/or firms.</p><p>  In October, together with Minister for Health Dr James Reilly, I launched a Demonstrator Project for the Health Innovation Hub at University College Cork. The Health Innovation Hub seeks to harness Ireland&rsquo;s vibrant Life Science industrial and clinical base by securing health system participation in driving commercialisation pathways for innovative health related products and services and contributing to the health service transformation agenda.  Healthcare, which is a key global market, requires innovation derived from clinical involvement with healthcare professionals and testing and validation in real world clinical settings to create exportable platforms.</p><p>  The Hub provides a framework for the health and enterprise sectors to work together to develop the innovative new solutions required to support the global healthcare transformation agenda. The Hub&rsquo;s primary function will be to support the generation, development, validation, evaluation and implementation of new healthcare initiatives. This will involve the healthcare, research and enterprise sectors working together in close collaboration to provide an effective route for new innovations from the outside (i.e. enterprise sector, researcher community) to access the healthcare system for development, validation, evaluation and to support the adoption and commercialisation of new innovations developed by healthcare practitioners inside the system.</p><p>  For the life sciences industry, the Hub is an opportunity to get access to the health service in order to develop and test new ideas and ultimately create new products and services that the health service can use and which can then be developed as commercially viable businesses.</p></reply>

The aim is to deliver high quality, accessible micro-enterprise and small business supports that promote the creation and maintenance of employment, nurture entrepreneurship and innovation and a culture of delivery.</p><p>  The programme of reform will draw on the best experience in the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities in an integrated fashion.  A First-Stop-Shop will be created at local level bringing local enterprise support into an integrated national network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOS) situated within Local Authorities, operating under a Service Level Agreement with Enterprise Ireland (EI).</p><p>  Following the publication of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, I conducted a nationwide consultation process with business, the purpose of which was to outline the Government&rsquo;s approach to the creation of employment and to hear the views and ideas of entrepreneurs on what type of supports they required to protect existing jobs and create new ones. In the course of my interaction with business people on the ground, I learned that in many instances there was a dearth of awareness of many of the schemes available to support small and micro businesses and that an appetite existed within enterprise circles for more extensive business orientated information and more user friendly points of access - and that there is a clear need for a network of first-stop-shops for enterprise support at a local level.</p><p>  On foot of the Government decision in April to dissolve the CEBs and transfer the functions, assets and liabilities to EI, an Implementation Working Group (IWG) was formed, chaired by my Department. Whilst business organisations were not included in the IWG, I have continued to consult with them primarily through the Advisory Group for Small Business (AGSB).  The AGSB raised concerns about the delivery of the new model through a Local Authority entity.  The IWG extended an invitation to representatives of the AGSB which I also attended and this was a useful opportunity for a robust and informative exchange of views. I am satisfied that the AGSB have a clear understanding of the objective of this reform process and that their concerns were addressed. The IWG has made significant progress in determining the structures, functions and staffing arrangements for the new model.  In tandem, the establishment of a Micro and Small Business Unit to develop a Centre of Excellence within Enterprise Ireland is at an advanced stage.</p><p>  Yesterday, as part of my ongoing efforts to engage and consult with the business community in particular, I published a consultation paper which sets out the vision of this reform process.  I am keen to receive the opinions from the micro and small business sector across Ireland, particularly on how the changes to be brought about can best provide support to the right people, at the right time and at the right level.</p><p>  Within the next few weeks, I intend to engage with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs to facilitate discussion and input on the draft Heads of the legislation required to implement the earlier Government Decision.</p></reply>

We are now in the top 20 in the world for the quality of our scientific output, and in the top 10 globally in a number of specific areas such Immunology (3<sup>rd</sup>) and Materials Science (8<sup>th</sup>). The challenge now is to build on these achievements and take our performance to the next level, and that is what the reforms across our research system are aimed at achieving.</p><p>  In February this year the Government agreed to the adoption of the recommendations of the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group (referred to as the <b>NRPE</b> &#8211; the National Research Prioritisation Exercise) as a whole of Government policy goal. This essentially means that the <i>majority</i>   of the state's investment in competitive, publicly performed R&amp;D will be focussed on the 14 priority areas and 6 underpinning areas identified in the report - the areas that were judged most likely to deliver economic and societal impact and ultimately jobs.</p><p>  In tandem with focussing investment in these 14 areas the report recommends that research funders ensure that they test for impact on, as well as relevance to, these priority areas in addition, of course, to continuing the drive for excellence in research. However, this does not mark a departure from funding in basic research and in fact the Steering Group's Report states clearly that &quot;a healthy, balanced, sustainable research system supports all aspects of the research continuum and this cannot be achieved by focussing investment on only the applied part of the research continuum&quot;. Within the proportion of funded affected by the NRPE, basic research will also be supported but it must show relevance to and impact on one of the priority areas if it is within the funding that is being prioritised.</p><p>  Given Ireland&#8217;s current fiscal circumstances there is a need to accelerate the delivery of economic and societal benefits from our investment in research by prioritising resources in areas of opportunity, building closer collaboration between the research base and enterprise and making it easier to commercialise and use new knowledge.  However, we recognise that we cannot sustain this without maintaining the world class research base that we have built over the past decade or so. We must succeed in both maintaining our quality research base and accelerating the delivery of the benefits of this investment at the same time and within the resources available.</p><p>  Therefore consistent with Government policy, SFI is now seeking to build upon the groundwork already put in place by continuing to invest in excellent research and by engendering greater impact from its funded research for the benefit of Ireland. It is important to reiterate that SFI was established under an enterprise ministry in 2000 and its mandate has always been to deliver on the future competitiveness needs of Irish enterprise. Therefore the relevance and impact of science being supported by SFI to the enterprise base is not a new development.</p><p>  SFI will continue to fund research within the 14 prioritised areas and the 6 underpinning areas. SFI will be ensuring that the focus on commercial outcomes will not have any negative impact on the high standards of scientific research &#8211; it will continue to focus on research excellence with impact for Ireland.</p><p>  It is also important to appreciate that SFI research grant funding is typically in the region of &#8364;150m per annum. This represents approximately 25% of the overall publicly funded R&amp;D performed in the State. There are also significant research funding agencies spread across a range of Government Departments spanning Education, Health, Energy, Agriculture, Marine and the Environment.</p><p>  For example, in addition to SFI, and with policy responsibility falling to the Department of Education and Skills, the Irish Research Council (IRC), was formally established in March 2012 by the Minister for Research and Innovation, Se&aacute;n Sherlock TD.  The IRC will continue the various activities of the two former Councils, IRCHSS and IRCSET.  The remit of the IRC covers the full range of disciplines and has the broad remit of supporting and enhancing human capacity development; in particular at postgraduate and early stage postdoctoral researcher levels.  Furthermore the IRC will support and encourage independent exploratory research.</p><p>  The international research community is highly mobile so there will always in-flow and out-flow of talented researchers. There is no evidence to date to suggest that talented researchers are being forced to emigrate from Ireland as a consequence of the recent introduction of the Government&#8217;s Research Prioritisation policy. Since 2008 SFI has managed to maintain supports to a cohort of 3,000 or so researchers out of the national cohort of approximately 7,500 or so.</p></reply>

An objective of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 is to continue the development of mechanisms to promote and deliver early stage investment in new indigenous start-ups from international sources, including the Irish diaspora.  The following initiatives are being progressed by Government to enable the achievement of this objective in relation to the Irish diaspora:</p><p>  A &#8364;10 million International Start-Up Fund administered by Enterprise Ireland, aimed at encouraging overseas entrepreneurs to locate start-up businesses in Ireland, was launched in October 2011. The Fund is open to company promoters anywhere in the world, but is being targeted particularly at the Irish diaspora, international expatriates, the &#8220;New Diaspora&#8221; (people from overseas who have previously worked or studied in Ireland), as well as serial and mobile entrepreneurs. To date, 12 projects have been approved and are underway, while a strong pipeline of prospects for conversion in 2013 has also been established.</p><p>  The second call for expressions of interest under the Innovation Fund Ireland was launched on 15<sup>th</sup> March 2012 with a closing date of 14<sup>th</sup>   June 2012. As part of the announcement, the Government through Enterprise Ireland will invest a total of more than &#8364;60million in Venture Capital Funds which establish a presence in Ireland. I expect to be in a position to announce further investments under this Fund in the near-term.</p><p>  On 8th March 2012, the Government launched the &#8220;Succeed in Ireland&#8221; initiative, administered by IDA Ireland, which aims to create 5,000 jobs within five years by targeting international companies and business people, who would otherwise not be reached by the State enterprise agencies, for employment opportunities to Ireland. This initiative can be accessed via the Connect Ireland website </p><p>  The &#8220;Succeed in Ireland&#8221; initiative provides direct financial incentives to people around the world to create employment in Ireland by making payments to people responsible for bringing sustainable jobs to Ireland. Small and medium sized companies around the world considering expansion, but who would not be large enough to be reached by the State enterprise agencies, will be targeted in particular by the new initiative. The Irish community around the world will be a major focus of the programme.  One project has already been announced &#8211; Intergeo Services is to establish its <font color="#2F2F2F">European, Middle East and African (</font>EMEA) Headquarters in Carlow, with the potential for 30 skilled jobs.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland&#8217;s Senior Management team are focusing on the roll-out of a number of joint pilot initiatives, including marketing and events aimed at attracting entrepreneurs and start-ups to Ireland.  The first joint event was held from 8<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup>   September 2012.  Joint preparations are underway for the &#8216;Le Web&#8217; event which is taking place in Paris in December 2012. The joint senior management team will continue to work on identifying further areas of engagement during 2013 as well as refining current approaches.</p><p>  Other initiatives to address investment in Ireland include: the development and launch of the Immigrant Investor Programme in April 2012; the holding of an International Investor Forum in London on 21 November hosted by Enterprise Ireland; and the sharing of information through the Global Irish Network, which is operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland. This Network provides information on relevant events focussed on investment in indigenous start-up companies and the Business Angels Network. Discussions are underway on ways to enhance and facilitate awareness and engagement by members of the Global Irish Network.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs is designed to help achieve that ambition and, as part of the Action Plan, the Government has set out a series of ambitions which represent key investment and employment goals:</p><p>- To become the best small country in which to do business.</p><p>- To build world-class clusters in key sectors of opportunity. - To build an indigenous engine of growth that drives up the export market share of Irish companies.</p><p> - To support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016 with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020.</p><p>  In seeking to deliver on these objectives, the Action Plan for Jobs sets out a major programme of work representing more than 270 individual actions for delivery during 2012.  The targets that have been set for the enterprise development agencies relate to the number of jobs to be created and the number of business investments to be won rather than in percentages of GDP. For example, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s specific targets for job creation and investment  for the period 2010 to 2014 are set out in the Agency&rsquo;s Strategy document &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; as follows:</p><p>- 105,000 new jobs (62,000 in IDA supported companies and a further 43,000 indirect).</p><p>- 640 Investments.</p><p>- 50% of investments located outside Dublin and Cork.</p><p>- 20% of greenfield investments originating from emerging markets by 2014.</p><p>- Annual client spend of &euro;1.7bn in R, D&amp;I by 2014.</p><p>  In the case of Enterprise Ireland, while the Agency is working on a number of areas to increase business investment and extend its direct financial support to grow companies, the targets set relate to numbers rather than a percentage of GDP. By way of illustration, some of their targets for 2012 include:</p><p>- To support 200 significant investment projects by client companies (i.e. projects entailing a total investment of &euro;500,000 or more) has been set in the Action Plan for Jobs and is expected to be achieved.</p><p>- To support 95 High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs) during 2012, which will be the highest number of HPSUs ever supported.</p><p>- In relation to R&amp;D, the goal is to have at least 740 companies spending at least &euro;100,000 on R&amp;D per annum. </p><p>  Additionally, Enterprise Ireland has focused on the development of a Seed and Venture Capital industry in Ireland, with recent activity including the introduction of a new Seed fund, the launch of the Development Capital Scheme and the second call for Innovation Fund Ireland.</p><p>  With regard to investment in research and development (R&amp;D), Ireland&rsquo;s goal under the Europe 2020 Strategy is to improve the conditions for R&amp;D with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 2.5% of GNP (c. 2.0% of GDP) by 2020 and we are currently on track to reach that target.  The latest available data show that the research intensity rate for 2011 is now estimated at 2.17% of GNP (1.77% of GDP) with Business Expenditure on R&amp;D amounting to 1.52% of GNP, which is equivalent to 1.2% of GDP.</p></reply>

The 2011 survey shows that net employment in IDA supported companies in the pharmaceutical and healthcare services sector, which includes the pharmachemical sector, increased by 1,400 during 2011. Employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies in the sector rose by 20% in 2011.  Latest data show that the pharmaceutical sector employed almost 25,000 people in 2011 with exports valued at almost &euro;40 billion. </p><p>  In seeking to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the pharmaceutical sector has been to win leading company investment and to diversify the breadth of operations over multiproduct sites including associated services and development of new compounds. This strategy is being successfully implemented with the result that Ireland is now home to eight of the major global pharmaceutical companies and the world&rsquo;s number one biotechnology company. </p><p>  The history of FDI in Ireland is the progressive addition of new sectors and business models enabled by new technologies and innovative policy interventions.  Recognising that continued success requires a process of constant transformation and a move to higher value added products and outputs, IDA Ireland, in accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, is focusing, in particular, on biopharmaceuticals, which represent the next wave of opportunity in the pharmaceutical industry.  The Agency has successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from companies such as Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck and Pfizer. Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of Pharmaceutical products.</p><p>  The success of pharmaceutical companies in Ireland reflects the targeted approach taken by IDA to this important global industry and the many advantages that Ireland has in terms of skills, track record, infrastructure etc. We will always seek to maintain an appropriate mix in our industrial and enterprise base and the other areas that we are seeking to develop reflects this eg. ICT, Digital Content, Games, Financial Services etc. As this Government's policies begin to reverse the damage inflicted on the economy by over-reliance on construction, I would expect these other sectors to increase their volume of exports and associated jobs.</p></reply>

The 270 actions are further broken down into Quarterly milestones or &ldquo;measures&rdquo;.  Progress Reports on the delivery of these measures are published at the end of each Quarter.  The third Progress Report on the Action Plan for Jobs was published on 17th October last.  It showed that 218 (96%) of the 227 measures to be achieved in the first three Quarters of 2012 were delivered on time.  Nine measures for completion in Quarter 3 were delayed.  Three of these directly involve my Department.  They relate to legislative measures covering:</p><p>- the extension of SFI&rsquo;s remit to allow the agency to fund applied research,</p><p>- the proposed new structure for the employment rights institutions, and </p><p>- the Consolidated Companies Bill.     </p><p>  These pieces of legislation have been delayed for a number of reasons, including the detailed and complex nature of the legislation in question, the demand on resources in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and the availability of time for legislative business in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, I expect to publish the Consolidated Companies Bill by the end of the year and every effort is being made to ensure that the remaining legislation is progressed as quickly as possible.   </p><p>  One of the other measures which was delayed in Quarter 3 involves the introduction of a voluntary Code of Conduct for payments within the private sector.  This measure is for delivery by the business sector.  However, there has been positive engagement between my Department and business representative groups on the matter and I am confident that substantial progress will be made on the publication of a Code of Conduct in 2013.

As I have indicated, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, initiated a consultation process earlier this year on the feasibility and implications of introducing a statutory sick pay scheme. This was very much a first step in considering a range of issues that need to be examined in detail before any proposals can be progressed to possible implementation.  Any formal proposals for changes in the sick pay scheme would have to be examined by Government as part of the Budgetary process.  However, to assist me in my consideration of these matters generally, I asked Forf&aacute;s to examine the potential impact on competitiveness and employment of statutory sick pay, if such a scheme were to be introduced in this country.  The report provided to me by Forfas forms part of a deliberative process of Government business, and it would not be appropriate for me to publish the report at this stage.</p></reply>

Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union in order to redress regional disparities.  Decisions on Regional Aid eligibility are taken by examining,  in the first instance, the relative position regarding the various Member States Gross Domestic Product. After that, unemployment rates are also taken into account. </p><p>  The current Regional Aid Map for 2007-13 was drawn up in accordance with the Commission&rsquo;s Current Regional Aid Guidelines.  The details of the support in terms of aid intensity for each county are available on my Departments website www.djei.ie.  The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines is underway. The Commission is scheduled to forward proposals to Member States in December 2012, documenting the structure and provisions that will form the basis of the revised Guidelines. For the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Map, economic data for all counties will once again be analysed afresh.

The 270 actions are further broken down into Quarterly milestones.  Progress Reports on the delivery of these milestones are published at the end of each Quarter.  Details of all actions delivered to the end of the third Quarter of the year are available in these Progress Reports on my Department&rsquo;s website www.enterprise.gov.ie.  The third Progress Report on the Action Plan for Jobs was published on 17th October 2012.  It indicated that 218 (96%) of the 227 milestones to be achieved in the first three Quarters of 2012 have been delivered to date, with nine actions outstanding.  </p><p>  Some significant objectives have been realised, including the establishment of a Microfinance Fund for small business, the introduction of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme, new supports for first time exporters, the launch of a new Women-In-Business programme, the simplification and extension of the Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Exemption scheme, the launch of a National Broadband Plan, the piloting of a Health Innovation Hub, and work being undertaken to develop sectors such as Cloud Computing, Digital Games, Manufacturing, and the Green Economy.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is a rolling plan and part of a multiannual process that builds on the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative of May 2011.  The aim of the Plan is to transform the operating environment for business and support the creation of 100,000 new jobs by 2016.  The Action Plan therefore has a medium-term objective, but there have been some notable positive developments in the last 18 months. </p><p>  2011 saw an increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies, compared to net losses of 15,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010. So far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 8,500 further jobs as these projects come on stream.  Similarly, jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies started to grow again in 2011, for the first time in three years.  In the first eight months of 2012, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, were secured.  Enterprise Ireland companies also achieved &euro;15.2 billion in exports last year &ndash; the highest level ever.</p><p>  While the economy has experienced job losses in sectors that were not sustainable at previous levels, such as Construction and domestic banking, employment has increased in a number of sectors that are the focus of the Action Plan for Jobs.  For example, employment in the Tourism sector increased by 6,300 over the period June 2011 to June 2012.  There were also modest increases in Agri-food and ICT.  The number of people employed in Digital Games has also doubled since 2009.  The full impact of the measures being taken under the Action Plan for Jobs will become apparent over time, but we are already seeing encouraging progress.

Over time, this allocation and the allocation methodology will be reviewed by my Department and Enterprise Ireland to ensure that opportunities for business development are maximised and that value for money is being secured across the LEO network. Such reviews will in the future be more greatly informed by achievement of targets and performance metrics as well as other relevant factors such as population and local demand. </p><p>  To this end, Enterprise Ireland is tasked with developing, with Local Authorities, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) detailing policy, operational guidelines and metrics. This will take the form of a single national template, suitably modified to take account of local circumstances.  Furthermore, currently each CEB Board is assisted by an Evaluation Committee, which makes recommendations on the most appropriate form, or level, of support for projects. This Committee is usually comprised of local professionals with banking/accounting/business expertise. It is intended that Evaluation Committees along the lines of the existing Committees will continue to operate under the new structure.  It is envisaged that these measures will ensure sufficient flexibility in the funding mechanism to allow the LEOs to respond appropriately to local demand.</p></reply>

The establishment of an Enterprise Ireland/Industrial Development Authority Senior Management Team is one such action which is being implemented to drive effective collaboration on identified areas of opportunity and which can contribute to the achievement of our high level goals.  The joint Senior Management Team has focused on the formulation of pilot initiatives.  Some of the initiatives that have been rolled out so far include:</p><p>- The development of an Enterprise Ireland/IDA company engagement model and shared itineraries, including marketing and events, aimed at attracting entrepreneurs and start-ups to Ireland.</p><p>- Joint initiatives, including marketing and events, aimed at attracting entrepreneurs and start-ups to Ireland.</p><p>- Joint approaches to sectoral development.</p><p>  The first joint event initiative aimed at attracting entrepreneurs and start-ups to Ireland was the Tech Crunch Conference which was held in San Francisco from the 8th-12th  September 2012.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland hosted a pre-conference VIP dinner for the speakers involved in the conference.  </p><p>  Joint preparations are underway for the &lsquo;Le Web&rsquo; event which is taking place in Paris in December 2012.  It is one of the largest technology conferences in Europe which attracts some 2,400 people from 60 countries including some of the biggest names in the US and European tech industries.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will have a joint presence at the conference to attract Start-Up companies and entrepreneurs to strategically grow and internationalise their business in Ireland.</p><p>  Both these events are significant marketing tools for increasing Ireland&rsquo;s image as being one of the best locations in Europe for early stage companies.  The work of this team is not independent or separate to the work of the respective agencies, but instead contributes to the achievement of each agency&rsquo;s employment and investment targets.</p></reply>

This strategy is being successfully implemented with the result that Ireland is now home to eight of the major global pharmaceutical companies and the world&rsquo;s number one biotechnology company. Latest data show that the pharmaceutical sector employed almost 25,000 people in 2011 with exports valued at almost &euro;40 billion. </p><p>  The history of FDI in Ireland is the progressive addition of new sectors and business models enabled by new technologies and innovative policy interventions. Recognising that continued success requires a process of constant transformation and a move to higher value added products and outputs, IDA Ireland, in accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, is focusing, in particular, on biopharmaceuticals, which represent the next wave of opportunity in the pharmaceutical industry. The Agency has successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from companies such as Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck and Pfizer. Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of Pharmaceutical products.</p><p>  The success of pharmaceutical companies in Ireland reflects the targeted approach taken by IDA to this important global industry and the many advantages that Ireland has in terms of skills, track record, infrastructure etc. I am not concerned that this sector is thriving. We will always seek to maintain an appropriate mix in our industrial and enterprise base and the other areas that we are seeking to develop reflects this eg. ICT, Digital Content, Games, Financial Services etc. As this Government's policies begin to reverse the damage inflicted on the economy by over-reliance on construction, I would expect these other sectors to increase their volume of exports and associated jobs.</p></reply>

The EU average was 22.1%, with several countries having a higher youth unemployment rate than Ireland.</p><p>  The latest Quarterly National Household Survey, published by the CSO on 19 September, indicates that 66,500 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years were unemployed in the second quarter of 2012.  Supporting these young people to help them access jobs requires effort on the part of a number of Government Departments.</p><p>  The Government is tackling unemployment generally through the twin strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  The aim of the Action Pan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed.  Many young people will benefit from the opportunities provided through these initiatives. Pathways to Work includes various training, education and work experience initiatives delivered by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placement, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries this year, including through the JobBridge internship programme.  To date, over 12,000 participants have commenced JobBridge placements, which by its nature, is very amenable to participation by young people.  An interim evaluation of JobBridge which was conducted recently by Indecon shows that over 50% of interns secured jobs following their participation on JobBridge.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection also recently launched a new service, Intreo, which provides individualised supports to jobseekers to assist them in getting back to work and increasing their employability.   </p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills will provide over 450,000 education and training places this year under Pathways to Work, across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors. These places will include provision for school leavers. The new &#8364;20 million Labour Market Education and Training Fund operated by the Department of Education &amp; Skills will also include specific provision for those under 25 years of age. </p><p>  Under the National Employment Action Plan process, 35,400 people under 25 years of age were referred to the Employment Services last year.  Of those referred, 62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color="#004080">  </font>For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers.

REAs involve the agreement of minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment which, once registered with the Labour Court, are legally binding on those operating in that sector.</p><p>Contractors working in the construction sector come within the terms of the REA for the Construction Industry where they are building or civil engineering undertakings which undertake any of the activities set out in the agreement.  Contractors come within the terms of the REA for the Electrical Contracting Industry where the main activity of the business is the performance of electrical work on a contract or sub-contract basis for a third party.</p><p>There are a number of possible methods of securing compliance in respect of employers, engaged in public construction works contracts including measures provided for in the Public Works Contracts and inspections by National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).</p><p>The Government Public Works Contracts require all contractors and subcontractors engaged thereunder to comply with specific employment rights provisions. The conditions of these contracts place an obligation on the main contractor to ensure compliance with the REAs for all those employed on a construction site.  This is not limited to the main contractor&rsquo;s own employees but includes all sub-contractors who provide labour to the site.  Contracting authorities are required to ensure that a certificate of compliance (titled &lsquo;Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate&rsquo;) is received from the main contractor with each payment application and, in the event of non-compliance, to withhold payment until the matter is rectified.  The ultimate sanction if a main contractor continues to be non-compliant is for the main contract to be terminated.</p><p>Where there is a suspicion that the provisions of a Public Works Contract are not being complied with a complaint should be raised, in the first instance, with the contracting authority that has the authority under the contract to obtain payment records for all those employed on site to establish whether there are issues to be addressed.   Should there be substance to the complaint then the contracting authority may withhold payments in line with the conditions of the contract and NERA can be called upon to investigate the matter further.</p><p>NERA is responsible for enforcing minimum statutory employment rights entitlements in the State, and in undertaking that role carries out a range of functions including the provision of employment rights information and the inspection of employment related records. NERA operates a system of risk based inspections in sectors where there are identifiable risks. Inspections are also carried out in response to complaints received and routine inspections are undertaken as a control measure.</p><p>The Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014 established a mechanism to monitor compliance with employment law, including REAs, in operations which are the subject of outsourcing.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform notified each Department on 22 December 2011 of these arrangements.</p><p>It is a condition of any contract entered into by a public authority with a private sector entity (other than for operations that may reasonably be considered as small scale) that the entity is required to provide a right to certain information.  This information should allow the authority to assess compliance with employment legislation, including relevant REAs, consistent with the requirements of EU and national law.  Any sub-contractors employed are also required to adhere to these conditions.</p><p>When a contract is awarded, the public authority must notify a nominated trade union official of its award, using a standard form.  The authority must also notify NERA and provide it with a copy of the form.  A dedicated email address (notification@employmentrights.ie) has been setup in this regard.  A total of 35 notifications have been provided to NERA to date.</p><p>The following table provides details of inspections carried out by NERA under the Construction and Electrical REAs for the period 2010 to end August 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>&middot;Legislation</th><th>Cases</th><th>Compliance Level %</th><th><div>Unpaid Wages Recovered &#8364;</div></th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>Construction REA</td><td><div>407</div></td><td><div>56%</div></td><td><div>213,297</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Electrical REA</td><td><div>40</div></td><td><div>60%</div></td><td><div>51,946</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Totals</td><td><div>447</div></td><td><div>56%</div></td><td><div>265,243</div></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>*</td><td><div>*</div></td><td><div>*</div></td><td><div>*</div></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>Construction REA</td><td><div>399</div></td><td><div>58%</div></td><td><div>269,910</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Electrical REA</td><td><div>54</div></td><td><div>52%</div></td><td><div>21,596</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Totals</td><td><div>453</div></td><td><div>57%</div></td><td><div>291,506</div></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>*</td><td><div>*</div></td><td><div>*</div></td><td><div>*</div></td></tr><tr><td>2012 (to end Aug)</td><td>Construction REA</td><td><div>183</div></td><td><div>49%</div></td><td><div>99,344</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Electrical REA</td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>63%</div></td><td><div>35,226</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Totals</td><td><div>213</div></td><td><div>51%</div></td><td><div>134,570</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Compliance by contractors working on public contracts would be enhanced if NERA, and relevant Awarding Authorities of Government Public Works Contracts, could share appropriate information and thus provide for an effective utilisation of the provisions in public sector contracts designed to secure compliance with employment law.  However, NERA are advised that there is a difficulty in sharing certain information with some contracting authorities, particularly from a data protection viewpoint.</p><p>As you may be aware, I have commenced a root and branch reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services.  This will include improved measures to secure compliance with employment law generally. The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill, which will give legislative effect to the new Workplace Relations structures, has been approved by Government for priority drafting and I hope to publish this Bill in early 2013.</p><p>It is my intention that the Workplace Relations Bill should provide for the new Workplace Relations Commission, to pass on to any contracting entity concerned, any firm information that the Commission may have as to non-compliance with employment legislation by any contractor of that contracting entity, so that the contracting entity can take such action under the contract as may be justified in the circumstances.  Permitting such an exchange of information could enable the activation   of the existing provisions within the Government Public Works Contracts whereby retention of monies may take place pending the proper payment to workers of monies due to them at the prevailing legal/REA rates.  My officials are in discussions with the Offices of the Data Commissioner and Attorney General in this regard.</p><p>Subject to advices sought from the Attorney General, I also propose to provide for a legislative basis for the use of Compliance Notices. What I am proposing is that in circumstances where a Compliance Officer has formed an opinion that a scheduled contravention of employment law (including the non-payment of certain monies due to an employee under employment law), and the employer concerned fails or refuses to rectify the non-compliance the Compliance Officer shall issue a Compliance Notice setting out the steps the employer must take to effect compliance.  It is also proposed to provide that an employer may appeal against all or any aspect of the notice to the Labour Court.</p><p>I am also proposing that if the employer does not appeal and fails or refuses to rectify or set out in writing how he or she proposes to rectify the matters set out in the notice, the Compliance Officer may make a complaint to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court may hold a hearing where the employer and the Compliance Officer would be heard.  The Court will be empowered to cancel, alter or confirm the Compliance Notice and make a binding order similar to the current provision of Section 32(1)(b) of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  Such an order could direct the employer to do such things (including the payment of any sum due to a worker for remuneration in accordance with the legislation) as will, in the opinion of the Court, result in the law being complied with by the employer. If the employer fails to implement the Labour Court order he or she shall be guilty of an offence prosecutable in the District Court. As well as possibly imposing a fine on the employer, if found guilty, the District Court may order the employer to pay to the worker(s) concerned such compensation as it considers fair and reasonable in respect of the employer&rsquo;s non-compliance stated in the order of the Labour Court, in addition to the State&rsquo;s costs associated with seeking to enforce the Compliance Notice.  The reforms I am proposing are set out in detail in the policy document entitled, Legislating for a World-Class Workplace Relations Service which I submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in July 2012.  I am confident that the measures which I propose to introduce in the Workplace Relations Bill will provide a legislative basis to facilitate the more effective enforcement of REAs for the construction sector in the context of Public Works Contracts.</p></reply>

My role and that of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place to support enterprise growth and innovation so that employment can be created and maintained.  </p><p>  This Government inherited a situation where over 300,000 jobs had been lost in the three years prior to March 2011, our banking system had all but collapsed, and we were in the middle of a world-wide economic downturn.  The country had become too dependent on a small number of sectors to support our economic performance &ndash; an approach that was neither wise nor sustainable.  </p><p>  Rescuing our economy from this situation requires transformational and structural change.  We need to build an economy that is based on added-value, exports and innovation - one that can support sustainable jobs into the future.  </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response to achieving this objective.  It focusses on transforming the landscape for enterprise by improving access to finance for companies, getting our cost base right, helping businesses to be more innovative and to win new markets.  This is being achieved by systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and by deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland.</p><p>  The Taoiseach has asked me to lead the Action Plan process, but, reflecting the priority the Government affords to job creation, it involves delivery across all Government Departments as well as 36 State agencies.  I have been working closely with my Ministerial colleagues to deliver on the commitments in the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs.  My Department also co-chairs, with the Department of the Taoiseach, a Monitoring Committee which oversees the delivery of the individual actions.   </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is a multiannual process which has the aim of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy by 2016.  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and will be exploring further measures that can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.</p></reply>

The report analyses competitiveness across the European Union as a whole and examines the related challenges and opportunities faced by European enterprises.  </p><p>  The focus of the 2012 report is on the potential for Europe to benefit from the globalisation of trade.  It points out that many of the opportunities for, and challenges to, EU recovery are to be found in markets outside Europe.  Emerging industrialised economies are increasingly competing with Europe, but they also offer opportunities for export growth.  </p><p>  The Competitiveness report is very detailed and technical, running to in excess of 260 pages, but it concludes that European industry is well positioned to benefit from globalisation.  </p><p>  In addition to the main report, the Commission has produced country-specific summaries of the competitiveness situation in each Member State.</p><p>  The summary for Ireland shows that we are better than the EU average in the vast majority of the competitiveness indicators examined, including in relation to labour productivity, our share of high-tech exports, the energy intensity of industry and our overall business environment.  </p><p>  Areas where Ireland is weak compared to the EU average are in relation to access to finance for SMEs, the cost of electricity for medium-sized enterprises and the availability of high speed broadband.</p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s report on Ireland acknowledges the actions that are being taken by the Government under the Action Plan for Jobs to improve the areas of deficit and concludes that the breadth of the Plan and the way implementation has started are promising signs that we are making a determined effort to reduce the differences in the competitiveness of the domestic and multinational sectors.  </p><p>  We will build on this progress in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which will set out further measures to improve our competitiveness. </p></reply>

There was further escalation with the targeted killing of a senior Hamas leader.</p><p>  In statements on 15 and 18 November, I expressed the Government&rsquo;s deep concern over the increase in violence and its effects in particular on innocent civilians.  I called clearly for a cessation of all attacks and the establishment of a durable ceasefire.</p><p>  On 19 November, I discussed the situation in Gaza with my EU colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Council.  We agreed that the efforts of the Egyptian Government and of other players to broker a ceasefire agreement provided the best chance of bringing this exchange of attacks to an end and we expressed our full support for those efforts.  The Council reiterated the need for an immediate ceasefire and noted that this outbreak of violence underlined the urgent need for progress to achieve a wider political settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p><p>  My Department was in contact with Egyptian officials to express our support and encouragement for their efforts.  We were also in contact with the Israeli authorities, both through the Ambassador here and through our own Embassy in Tel Aviv.  We repeated our concerns about civilian casualties and about the need to avoid further escalation, in particular through the possible launching of a ground campaign.  We acknowledged, as is appropriate and as we have always done, Israel&rsquo;s right to protect itself and its citizens from attack.  But we emphasised that this right is not a blank cheque.  Any actions taken must be proportionate and must clearly distinguish military targets from civilian facilities.</p><p>  I very much welcome the announcement of a ceasefire by all parties yesterday evening. The ceasefire appears to have come into effect as intended, and it is essential that all sides fully respect its terms. The peoples of both Gaza and Israel should be able to live their lives without fear. I commend the prompt and intensive efforts of the Egyptian Government to bring about this cessation of violence.</p><p>  I do not consider it appropriate to attempt in EU discussions to link this conflict to the separate question of Israeli settlements.  Indeed, I believe it would be counterproductive to do so.  The Israeli settlements in Gaza were evacuated in 2005.</p><p>  Following my recent discussions with Commissioner General Filippo Grandi of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) here in Dublin, and in light of the serious situation now in Gaza, I am considering the possibility, in light of the evolving situation on the ground, of providing additional funding for UNRWA's Emergency Appeal for Gaza.  In 2012 so far, my Department, through the Irish Aid programme, has already provided &euro;4.2 in support to UNRWA for its activities across its five areas of operation in the Middle East region, including in Gaza.</p></reply>

This means that a loan will have to be drawn down on or before 31 December 2012 in order to qualify for this relief. I have no plans to review this decision and I believe that more than adequate notice of this decision has been provided.</p><p>  As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current significant budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

It is the role of Revenue to ensure that all businesses, regardless of the type of activity they are engaged in, are registered for the appropriate taxes and duties, and that they fulfil their obligations with regard to the filing of returns and the payment of taxes.   Revenue&rsquo;s tax compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow/hidden economy.  I am advised that Revenue tackles the problem of tax and duty evasion through their range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&rsquo;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available.</p><p>  In addition, Revenue uses a wide range of methodologies to identify those who under-declare their income and/or are operating in the shadow/hidden economy, and deploys the full range of compliance interventions to tackle those risks. Activities undertaken can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre arranged aspect queries on specific items. This work is continuing. There is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature, and I am informed that in the first eight months of 2012 audits specifically targeted at these businesses yielded over &euro;12m.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that, specifically regarding the retail and wholesale motor vehicle parts and accessories sector, 25 Audits have been carried out so far in 2012, yielding &euro;407,063. In 2011, 37 audits were carried out in this sector, yielding  &euro;483,070. These statistics are compiled from Revenue&rsquo;s records and I am informed that within their records, the motor vehicle parts and accessories sector includes the tyre distributor industry.	</p></reply>

In the construction sector, Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) applies to payments made by a principal contractor to a subcontractor under a relevant contract (this is a contract to carry out, or supply labour for the performance of relevant operations in the construction industry). RCT applies to both resident and non-resident contractors. </p><p>  Following a review of the operation of the RCT system in 2010, a new, streamlined system was developed in 2011 and introduced from the 1st January 2012. All transactions subject to RCT must be notified to Revenue through the Revenue Online Service. This process provides the Revenue Commissioners with real time information on the activities of principal and subcontractors, which reduces the opportunities for fraud, allows for early intervention in suspected cases, and facilitates a more focused compliance approach allowing Revenue to concentrate its resources on tackling the non-compliant contractor and levelling the playing field for compliant contractors.</p><p>  Revenue has always maintained a significant presence in monitoring activities in the construction sector and is involved in an ongoing programme of construction related audits, compliance interventions and site visits, including one off housing, repairs, maintenance and enhancements.</p><p>  Some of the specific measures being implemented are:</p><p>-  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group, which provides a forum for the exchange of views and insights into combating the hidden economy. Its membership includes representatives from Irish Business and Employers Confederation, Small Firms Association, Construction Industry Federation, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, DSP, NERA, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, and Revenue. There are now 4 Regional Shadow Economy Liaison Groups. These regional groups have the same representation as the main group and are more effective at addressing local issues. Other bodies are asked to participate where appropriate.</p><p>-  Sharing information with the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the National Employment Rights Authority, where appropriate, on shadow activity in the sector is ongoing. Revenue&rsquo;s Joint Investigation Unit (JIU) continues to work closely with the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Agency to investigate the shadow economy and carry out joint investigations where appropriate.</p><p>- The joint Revenue/Department of Social Protection high-level Steering Group that was set up in late 2009 between Revenue and Department of Social Protection meets regularly to oversee joint initiatives in tackling the shadow economy and welfare fraud. Information/data exchanges have been streamlined recently with the introduction of shared (cloud) computing facilities</p><p>- Unannounced visits to one off housing and self -build sites are a regular feature of Revenue activity across all of the regions. In the course of these visits the status of all workers engaged on the site, together with the source of materials used, is checked to ensure compliance with VAT requirements.</p><p>- Revenue officers as part of projects to identify suitable sites to visit examine planning applications, and Commencement Notices filed with Local Authorities.</p><p>- Revenue uses confidential information and local intelligence to target suspect sites. While they mainly source cases through information in their own systems, I am advised that they also use intelligence gathered from a number of third party sources, including the general public</p><p>- Where grants or subsidies are paid out of public funds for construction related works, the contractor must provide evidence that they are tax compliant.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they carried out 375 audits on construction related activities in the period January to August 2012, yielding just over &euro;16m.</p><p>  I am aware that proposals have been made previously to link the granting of tax relief with evidence of tax compliance and, that Revenue would receive notification of the commencement of all construction projects.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are prepared to consider any proposals that would increase the level of tax compliance in the construction sector.  However, they will need to work through the proposals in more detail and consider, in particular, how they would operate in practice.  The Commissioners further advise that this can be done as part of their ongoing discussions with industry and other parties.  If, following this consultation process, it is felt that implementing the proposals would have value, I would be prepared to consider introducing legislation to cater for any such changes.</p></reply>

With regard to reducing the VAT rate on healthier foods, I would point out that the VAT rating of various foods already provides for such a distinction.  Most food products sold by retail shops are liable to VAT at the zero rate, including basic foodstuffs, for example, bread, butter, tea, meat, milk and vegetables.  However, flour or egg-based bakery products such as cakes, crackers and certain wafers and biscuits are liable to VAT at the 13.5% reduced rate.  Furthermore, the standard VAT rate of 23% applies to sweets, chocolates, chocolate wafers and biscuits and other similar products, confectionery, crisps, ice-creams and soft drinks, and also frozen desserts, frozen yogurts and similar frozen products.</p><p>  I would also point out that the zero VAT rate that applies to bread is specifically designed to include healthy breads, such as breads with seeds and grains, gluten-free breads; and to exclude those breads that contain excessively high levels of sugar and fat, such as croissants, brioche and danishes, which are liable to VAT at 13.5%.</p><p>  In general the VAT treatment of food is historic, where the application of the zero rate to healthier food products is a derogation from general EU VAT law, that Ireland is entitled to continue under the EU VAT Directive as we applied the zero rate to such foods on and from 1 January 1991.  It is not possible to apply the zero rate to any new food products.</p></reply>

They are members of the NTMA defined benefit superannuation scheme and as members of the scheme prior to 1 January 2010 their pension benefits are based on final salary.  The pension benefits of members who joined the scheme on or after 1 January 2010 are based on career average earnings.  Unlike most public pension schemes which are funded on a pay as you go basis, the NTMA superannuation scheme is a funded scheme. Pension entitlements are within the standard entitlements in the model public sector defined benefit superannuation scheme.  Pension contributions are not paid to individual employees &ndash; they are paid into the scheme. The level of potential pension payments to members is dependent on length of service, based on final salary or career average earnings, with 1/80th of salary accruing for each year of service.</p><p>7) Taxable benefits of NTMA and NAMA CEOs relate to car and health insurance as disclosed in 2011 annual reports.</p><p>8) The Chief Executives of the NTMA and NAMA waived any consideration for performance related pay in respect of 2010 and 2011.</p><p>Further details of the remuneration for the Chief Executive of the National Asset Management Agency was provided to the Deputy in the response to three other parliamentary questions (Ref: 51153/12, 51154/12 and 51155/12) on the same date.</p><p><table><tr><th>.</th><th>2011 &#8364;</th><th>2010 &#8364;</th></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>430,000</td><td>430,000</td></tr><tr><td>Taxable benefits (car and health insurance)         </td><td>24,483      </td><td>23,036      </td></tr></table></p><p>For the earlier years information in relation to Chief Executive pay can be found in the published annual report and accounts.   <b></b></p><p><table><tr><th>.</th><th>2011/2010 data</th><th>2009 data</th></tr><tr><td>AIB</td><td>Pages 380 and 381 of 2011 Annual Report and Accounts</td><td>Page 262 of 2009 Annual Report and Accounts</td></tr><tr><td>BOI</td><td>Pages 160 and 162 of 2011 Annual Report and Accounts</td><td>Page 120 of 2009 Annual Report and Accounts</td></tr><tr><td>IBRC</td><td>Pages 149 and 150 of 2011 Annual Report and Accounts</td><td>Page 146 of 2009 Annual Report and Accounts</td></tr><tr><td>PTSB</td><td>Page 62 of 2011 Annual Report of Irish Life and Permanent Group Holdings</td><td>Page 59 of 2009 Annual Report of Irish Life and Permanent Group Holdings</td></tr><tr><td>NTMA</td><td>Page 61 of 2011 Annual Report and Accounts, page 65 of 2010 Annual Report and Accounts </td><td>Current CEO took up office at the beginning of 2010.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

There are now more opportunities than ever before for postgraduate study, including an increasing number of flexible learning opportunities.  Funding for postgraduate research has also been protected in as far as possible.  The projected increase in undergraduate provision nationally would also seem to indicate that there will be a continuing strong demand for postgraduate provision in the future. However, I am asking the Higher Education Authority to monitor enrolment patterns in the coming years and to keep me informed.</p></reply>

Currently, the approved course for recognised Senior Cycle students of the established Leaving Certificate must include no fewer than five subjects of which one must be Irish (unless the student has an exemption from Irish). Overall, I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered at the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.  Schools are best placed to know the needs of their individual students.

Unlike most other areas of the public service teaching vacancies are being filled in accordance with published Department criteria.</p><p>  The number of teaching posts that we can afford to fund in schools in the coming years is a matter that I will have to consider with my colleagues in Cabinet in the context of budgetary requirements and meeting our obligations under the EU/IMF Programme. The challenge will be to ensure that the resources that can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.</p><p>  Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for recruitment of teachers, prioritising unemployed registered teachers over retired registered teachers and registered teachers over unregistered persons. Also in October last year my Department issued circular 46/2011 which permits schools to participate in JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme.</p><p>  It is in the public interest that there is an adequate supply of qualified teachers. However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables. Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict.</p><p>  I intend to explore the matter of teacher supply further with the HEA, the Teaching Council, and the initial teacher education providers, as appropriate.</p></reply>

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention and this may, or may not, involve the child undergoing a full educational psychological assessment.</p><p>  As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Parliamentary Question No 111 of 15 November 2012, the NEPS psychologist has as late as 8 October engaged with the teachers and parents of the child in question.  His needs have been reviewed and a number of strategies / interventions have been suggested by the psychologist and changes made accordingly by the school to the child's individual education plan (I.E.P.).  These actions are being implemented and will be reviewed on an on-going basis by the school and psychologist in order to judge their efficacy.  The Deputy will appreciate that the effectiveness of such interventions cannot be measured within the short interval that has elapsed.  The ongoing review referred to above will inform whether a full educational psychological assessment is necessary or indeed appropriate in this instance.  The school authorities will keep the child's parents informed of on-going developments in this regard.</p></reply>

The GAM allocations for all primary schools were updated this year, for the 2012/13 school year.</p><p>  An essential principle of the GAM is that the teaching resources which are made available to schools under the model should be allocated to pupils by the school taking into account the learning needs of those pupils.  Pupils with the highest level of need will, therefore have the highest level of support.  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of resource teaching support, including supports allocated under the GAM, to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.</p><p>  In circumstances where a child may be awaiting a diagnosis, learning support or resource teaching support can still be provided for that child from a school's general allocation of resource teaching/learning support provision, taking into account the needs of the child, pending formal diagnosis.  In the event of a low incidence disability diagnosis being forthcoming, an application may be made to the NCSE by the school for a low incidence resource allocation.</p><p>  My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  A parent who has concerns regarding the level of teaching support that their child is receiving in school should raise this with the school authorities in the first instance.</p></reply>

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.

My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

The Higher Education Authority (HEA), at my request, is undertaking a study on the sustainability of the current funding system for higher education. An initial report was published last year, which makes it clear that immediate work is required to prepare for a longer term approach to a system that can be maintained through a sustainable funding base which will be able to address the continual expansion of the sector while protecting quality of education.  The report also refers to the need for the HEI's to reduce their reliance on State funding and to create alternative sources of income from non governmental sources.  The HEA is doing further analysis in this area which will also address the need to realise greater efficiencies from existing infrastructure and resources and will report to me in 2013.</p></reply>

It is a key driver of innovation and technological advance, is an important source of jobs for people at all skills levels and generates many additional secondary jobs. Manufacturing is a key priority of enterprise policy comprising 64% of Enterprise Ireland (EI) supported jobs and over 50% of IDA supported jobs in 2011.  The following tables set out the job gains in manufacturing and services sectors from 2007 to 2011.<b>  </b>As agency-employed data is collated on an annual basis there is no data available yet in respect of 2012.  However, there has been a noticeable decline in numbers employed in manufacturing and in the contribution from manufacturing activities to Ireland&rsquo;s employment and exports over the past decade. This is not surprising, and it reflects similar trends in many developed economies, particularly small open economies that rely heavily on exports and do not have a tradition of large scale manufacturing.</p><p>To address the challenges facing this sector, this Government&rsquo;s <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2012 </i> (APJ) included a series of actions for the Manufacturing Sector and it noted that Ireland is well positioned to exploit the advances in manufacturing technology, and to build and maintain a strong base of manufacturing activity. The APJ pointed out that the activities taking place within the base of foreign owned companies are continuously changing and, in general terms, moving to more sophisticated and high value added activities involving elements of both manufacturing and services. Similarly, indigenous manufacturing was seen as becoming more sophisticated and knowledge-based.</p><p>A key proposal was that a <i>Manufacturing Development Forum</i>   be established to assist the Government in identifying the needs of manufacturing enterprises and to progress a transformation agenda. I have therefore established such a Forum in June last to help drive this process. Its membership comprises key industry players and there are also representatives from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forf&aacute;s.  I have asked the Forum to consider the biggest impediments to job creation in manufacturing in Ireland and the immediate areas of opportunities for job creation in the sector and it will provide expert insights to two key initiatives on manufacturing which I have set in train as part of the APJ:</p><p>-<b> A Long-term Vision and Strategic Plan.</b>  Forf&aacute;s has commenced a study to revisit the role of manufacturing in Ireland&rsquo;s economy to assess where it stands today and to set out a strategic vision for 2020 aimed at reversing the current employment trend and enabling a return to growth. This research will set out the policy actions needed to support a sustainable and competitive manufacturing sector to 2020 in the context of global trends, the on-going transformation of the sector and the existing issues facing the sector in Ireland. The Forum will provide expert insights into the development of this Plan.</p><p>- <b>An Assessment of Manufacturing Skills Needs:</b>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, working alongside Forf&aacute;s in the development of the Long-term Vision and Strategic Plan, is currently undertaking an in-depth study on the future skills needs of the manufacturing sector in Ireland, building on previous sub-sectoral work and undertaking new firm-level inquiry.</p><p>In relation to the number of jobs created through innovation and technology, it is not possible to disaggregate the contribution made by innovation and technology towards overall job creation in those sectors as these are key, but seamless aspects of the Manufacturing and Services sectors.</p><p>Forf&aacute;s&rsquo;s Annual Employment Study 2011 showed that between 2007 and 2011, services employment held fairly steady (109,134 in 2007 and 109,933 in 2011) with a total of 46,634 full-time jobs being recorded in the Irish-owned Services sector in 2011, a net gain of 428 jobs (0.9 per cent) over 2010. A total of 63,359 full-time jobs were recorded in the foreign-owned Services sector in 2011, with a substantial net gain of 4,236 jobs (7.2 per cent) over 2010.  Employment levels in key areas of the Services sector have therefore been very resilient in the period, which reflects the decisive shift in economic activity towards the sector.</p><p>There are many complex factors which contribute to job losses particularly over the period of the current recession.  The Government are fully committed to addressing these losses as outlined in the overall APJ.  I am confident that these measures, combined with other Government initiatives to improve Competitiveness generally, will provide strong practical support to these important sectors.</p><p><table><tr><th colspan="5">Manufacturing - Job Gains (Department agencies combined) </th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>2008</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>13,011</td><td>10,420</td><td>6,794</td><td>8,167</td><td>9,042</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="5">Services &amp; Other Sectors - Job Gains (Department agencies combined)</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>2008</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>15,877</td><td>13,244</td><td>7,168</td><td>12,221</td><td>11,996</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As figures are compiled on an annualised basis, figures in respect of 2012 will not be available until year end.</p><p>Job losses arise in the internationally trading sector of the economy for a variety of reasons including changing competitiveness, competition from sister sites, product and technology lifecycles, global location rationalisation as a result of mergers and acquisitions, or an amalgam of these factors.  In the majority of the cases involving relocation, the shift is to lower cost emerging economies with a smaller number of cases relocating to other developed country locations, largely in Eastern Europe.  Some of the job losses are due to cyclical factors and will be recovered.</p><p>IDA&rsquo;s strategy &ldquo;<i>Horizon 2020</i>  &rdquo; is focussed on winning as many new jobs as possible each year and giving equal priority to maintaining existing jobs.  IDA has assured me that it continues to focus sharply on both encouraging and assisting its client companies to move up the value chain in terms of carrying out higher skilled operations and expanding their presence in Ireland.  The IDA&rsquo;s aim is to retain existing clients, improve the quality of employment opportunities in Ireland and increase the positive economic impact. It does this by assisting its clients to:</p><p>- improve company &ndash; wide competitiveness</p><p>- enhance the use of new technologies</p><p>- grow the skills of the business</p><p>- engage in Research, Development and Innovation</p><p>- develop new business processes, and make company operations more energy efficient</p><p>2011 was a very good year for FDI in Ireland and in 2011 over 13,000 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies.

While I am aware that upward only rent reviews are putting pressure on some enterprises in the commercial and retail sectors at the present time, there are other factors influencing decisions of individual companies to reduce jobs.  The retail sector has, for example, seen a disproportionate fall in activity due to the fall in consumer confidence and a reduction in discretionary spending by Irish consumers.</p><p>  Recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the sector.  These actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include a renewed focus on prompt payments, the introduction of a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings, the provision of support to retail firms seeking to internationalise, and the provision of funding for the up-skilling of workers in the sector.</p><p>  Other measures in the Action Plan for Jobs which will also help to support employment the retail sector include:</p><p>- improved access to finance for businesses;</p><p>- the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms;</p><p>- supports to business to help them manage their energy costs; and</p><p>- the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates.</p><p>  Other initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May of last year will also continue to help support employment in the retail sector.  These include the halving of Employer&rsquo;s PRSI on earnings up to &euro;356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.  The most recent retail sales index has seen an increase in activity in the sector and there have been a number of seasonal and permanent job announcements by this sector in recent weeks.</p></reply>

Issues that influence a company&rsquo;s ability to compete successfully and win business include price, quality, innovative nature of the offering and customer service.  Competitiveness in the broad business environment is determined by a variety of factors, including the cost of doing business, productivity levels, availability of skilled labour, good infrastructure, the quality and intensity of innovation and research, and regulation that supports enterprise growth. </p><p>  As a country in which to do business and sell both at home and abroad, Ireland has regained some of the competitiveness it had lost and this is reflected in the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s rating improved four places from 24th to 20th in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2012.  Earlier this month, the World Economic Forum also reported that Ireland has improved its competitiveness ranking, from 29th to 27th place in that organisation&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Index.  </p><p>  Many Irish companies are among the best and most innovative in the world, with cutting edge, well priced goods and services.  Indigenous companies are now selling more overseas than any time in the history of the State. Buoyant international sales led to Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies achieving record levels of exports in 2011. The total export figures, at &euro;15.2bn, exceeded the pre-recession record levels of 2008 and new export sales exceeded &euro;2.14bn.</p><p>  Despite these encouraging trends, we must ensure that the improvements we have achieved are structural in nature and sustained in the longer-term.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes a range of initiatives to improve our competitiveness, including measures to promote investment in innovation and research in order to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base continues to produce the goods and services that customers want to buy; further measures to reduce costs for businesses and a suite of measures designed to align skills with enterprise needs and prioritise critical infrastructural investment.</p><p>  A number of steps have already been taken to enable indigenous firms to specialise, develop skills and value and scale up including:</p><p>- The launch of the new Potential Exporters Division in Enterprise Ireland, to support more indigenous companies to trade in foreign markets,</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s LEAN initiative aimed at productivity improvement and the development of new business models, thereby enabling client companies increase productivity and competitiveness,</p><p>- The Launch of a new Development Capital Scheme, aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth, indigenous companies, and</p><p>- Improvements to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme.</p><p>  We will build on this progress in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which will set out further measures to ensure that enterprises trading in and from Ireland continue to win business here and overseas, thereby promoting employment and economic growth.</p></reply>

Combined, the some 35,400 placements and supervisory positions are provided across Community Employment (23,300), the Rural Social Scheme (2,730), T&uacute;s (5,250), the Job Initiative (including the part-time Job Initiative) (1,300) and the Community Services Programme (2,800).  JobBridge, the national internship scheme, has a target of maintaining 6,000 internships and has made significant progress with 12,308 internships having commenced since its launch in July 2011. 67% of these placements are in the private sector, 22% are in the public sector and 11% are in the community/voluntary sector.  An interim evaluation of JobBridge found that 52.3% of those who have finished their internship are currently in paid employment.    T&uacute;s has provided 6,780 work placements and supervisory positions since its introduction in July 2011.  Given that nature of T&uacute;s, the number progressing to employment is not expected to be significant. To date, less than 200 people have left T&uacute;s to take up employment options.

Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.</p><p>  The change to State pension rate bands means that the pension in payment will reflect the PRSI contributions made over a working life. Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.  </p><p>  From September 2012, a lower pension is payable to new applicants for State pension who have a yearly average of less than 48 PRSI contributions. This measure introduces additional rates bands for State pension to more fairly reflect the proportionality of attachment to the workforce by the claimant. The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions, such as those in the scenario mentioned by the Deputy, will receive a lower rate of pension. </p><p>  Claimants with an income need, may, following a means test, qualify for a State pension (non-contributory).   The maximum rate of the (State pension non-contributory) is &euro;219.00 per week.   </p><p>  This change to rate bands introduced in September 2012, moves somewhat closer to a &lsquo;total contribution approach&rsquo; where those who pay more will benefit more.  The &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system and the proposed date for its introduction is 2020.   Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  </p><p>  There is also an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension as the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State pension age.   This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  </p><p>  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy and the pension reform measures underway contribute significantly to this strategy.   </p><p>  All information relating to the changes that I have outlined here is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

In conjunction with other agencies and in particular with the Revenue Commissioners, the Department continues to tackle the shadow economy by a combination of intelligence collation, assurance checks, data sharing and outdoor operations, including inspections and direct investigations. In addition, one of the priorities of the High Level Group of Senior Officials established between my Department and Revenue is to ensure on-going collaboration and interaction between the organisations, including oversight of activities designed to combat the shadow economy.</p><p>  The Department also participates on the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group with Revenue, Employer and Union representative bodies.  This Group provides a formal structure to monitor developments, share experiences and make proposals for combating the hidden economy.  In addition, the Department engages and meets with business and industry representatives. Increasingly, the Department is finding that bodies and individuals are prepared to share insights and specific information with us with regard to shadow economy activity.  Where intelligence or reliable reports are received about specific sectors or persons engaged in concurrent working and claiming or under declaration of income, then reviews of eligibility are immediately undertaken.  Case interventions are undertaken based on assessments of compliance risks and other relevant information.  The approach taken by the Department is frequently reviewed and is regularly adjusted to concentrate on the areas of greatest risk, based on its operational experience and credible information received from industry and business sectors.</p></reply>

INTREO is the integrated employment activation and supports service model that this Government promised to deliver in the Programme for Government and in &lsquo;Pathways to Work&rsquo;.  </p><p>  INTREO is the name for the new service model of the Department integrating the employment services and community programmes formerly of F&Aacute;S, and the Community Welfare Services (CWS) formerly of the HSE and the income support services provided by the Department itself.  </p><p>  The integration of functions and the transformation of the way the Department delivers its services were always envisaged as a multi-annual and iterative process of transformation.  </p><p>  Building upon the skills and processes in the enlarged Department, a new activation concept, the one-stop-shop has been developed and has been rolled out in four pilot offices, Sligo, King&rsquo;s Inns Parnell Street, Arklow and Tallaght.  </p><p>  Service performance has improved in all of the offices mentioned. For example, claim processing time has reduced from up to 4 weeks to under 1 week. Waiting times for new claimants for group interviews and follow up one-to-one interviews are now also under one week.  </p><p>  Other offices in Ballymun, Kilkenny, Buncrana, Coolock, Finglas and Dundalk will go live before the end of the year.  INTREO will be then be rolled out to all the Department&rsquo;s offices nationwide by the end of 2014, in a programme that is being carefully managed in a live operating environment. </p><p>  INTREO&rsquo;s one-stop-shop offices includes a single integrated decision-making team that integrates and streamlines the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into the Department.  Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.  </p><p>  On being awarded a claim, the client will also be asked to sign a &lsquo;social contract&rsquo; with the Department.  The client acknowledges their responsibility to work to secure employment at the earliest possible opportunity, on the understanding that failure to adhere to those undertakings may result in the reduction or withdrawal of income support payments.</p><p>  The most significant demands of the Pathways approach are: </p><p>i) profiles of clients to inform the approach taken to activation </p><p>ii) Early engagement with clients through group engagement sessions </p><p>iii) One to one interviews with case managers</p><p>  Progress under each of these headings is as follows:</p><p>(a) The Profiling of all new claimants has been operating in the four pilot one-stop shop locations and is now also operating in all other DSP offices. The roll-out programme has been completed ahead of the December 2012 target.</p><p>  With regard to the engagement/activation process generally:</p><p>(b) The Department targeted to involve 30,000 clients in group engagements in 2012 and has had 48,500 clients involved in group engagements by the end of September.</p><p>(c) The Department committed to holding 97,500 initial one-to-one guidance interviews with clients by the end of September 2012 but almost 123,000 had been held by that date.  That figure doesn&rsquo;t include the 109,000 follow-up meetings held by the end of September.</p><p>  INTREO is also refocusing the Department&rsquo;s relationship with employers.  The level of contact with employers at national and local level is already increasing. For example, Springboard Recruitment fairs were held in conjunction with HEA in Dublin, Galway and Cork during September and a series of seven employer briefings were held over October and November. </p><p>  The launch of INTREO marks a watershed in the way the Department responds to the needs of today&rsquo;s Ireland.  INTREO puts the flesh on the Government&rsquo;s policy initiatives to put Ireland back to work.</p></reply>

The winning bidders will pay &#8364;854.64 million for these spectrum rights, comprising firstly of Upfront Fees amounting to &#8364;481.7 million (adjusted as necessary by transitional arrangements) and secondly, Annual Spectrum Usage  Fees in the amount of &#8364;372.95 million which will be adjusted for inflation and paid in instalments until July 2030.  The duration of the licences is to 2030.  It is my understanding that slightly over 50% of the fees (approximately &#8364;450M) will be made available to the Exchequer this year.  Details of Upfront Fees and Spectrum Usage Fees for the duration of licences can be found in Section 2.2.5 of ComReg&#8217;s Information Memorandum 12/52, which is available on the ComReg website, .</p><p>  In addition to a strong return for the Exchequer, the allocation of Spectrum under auction will provide for the rollout of faster, fourth generation 4G mobile Internet services which will maintain and boost Ireland&#8217;s competitiveness.  This is a key component of the Government's National Broadband Plan which envisages high speed broadband services being rolled out across Ireland in the lifetime of this Government.</p><p>  ComReg has advised that the overall revenue raised compares favourably with prices observed recently in other comparable European auctions, although it is difficult to provide comparisons given the manner in which blocks of spectrum were packaged in the ComReg auction and variations between Member States in how spectrum is allocated, population size and other factors.</p></reply>

Then in the event of a commercial discovery being made, the oil or gas discovered would be demised to the licensees under a petroleum lease.  While the State would benefit in a number of ways, the principal financial benefit would result from the special higher rate of corporation tax that applies to profits from production of oil or gas.  A tax on profits of between 25% and 40% would apply in the case mentioned by the Deputy, in the event that the proposed drilling resulted in a commercial discovery. </p><p>  While a commercial discovery would be very positive news for Ireland, the reality is that unless there is a substantial increase in the level of drilling activity in the Irish offshore, the true potential of our natural resources will continue to be unknown.</p><p>  Taxation, royalty payments and production sharing are all instruments that can be used by a country to extract a value from production of its oil and gas resources. While these various instruments will impact in somewhat different ways, the key issue is to decide on the overall level of &ldquo;State take&rdquo; to aim for. In setting that level a country has to strike a balance between seeking to attract mobile international exploration investment and seeking to maximise the return to the State from successful exploration.  Since the 1980s Ireland has taken a tax based approach, following the example of neighbouring countries such as the UK and Norway. Royalty payments or production sharing would not apply to any new commercial discovery made in the Irish offshore.</p><p>  In relation to the specific issue of security of oil supply, Ireland is required under EU and IEA obligations to hold 90 days of oil reserves.  The bulk of Ireland&rsquo;s oil stocks are held by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), with the balance held by industry.</p></reply>

This dual funding model, which is consistent with EU State Aid rules, has been in place since the establishment of Raidi&oacute; Teilifis &Eacute;ireann at the start of the 1960&rsquo;s and is reflective of Ireland&rsquo;s population size and the nature of its market place.  Just as it would be too onerous a burden on television households to seek to fund RT&Eacute; solely from TV Licence receipts, it would not be sustainable from a media market point of view to try to operate it on a purely commercial basis.</p><p>  In regard to the actual mechanism for helping to determine the level of the licence fee, this is set out in Section 124 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  In particular it allows for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to recommend in a report to me, as Minister, an annual licence fee modification.  This recommendation is based on an annual review on the extent to which RT&Eacute; has fulfilled its commitments in respect of its public service objects stated in its annual statement of performance commitments for that financial year and the adequacy or otherwise of public funding to enable the corporation to meet its public service objects.</p><p>  The recommendation from the Authority informs any decision I, as Minister, may take in conjunction with the Government on adjusting the current level of television fee or otherwise.  In addition to the statutory requirement for annual reviews of the public service broadcasters, Section 124(8) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 requires the BAI to also carry out a long term forward looking 5-year review on the adequacy or otherwise of the funding of public service broadcasters.  The first 5 year review is now being undertaken by the BAI and will assist in informing any policy decisions I may take on the future public funding of public service broadcasters.</p><p>  The broadcasting sector in general, including the public broadcasting sector, has been facing a very challenging funding environment over the last few years with a large fall in commercial advertising revenues.  As regards public sector broadcasters, this situation demands that they remain vigilant in relation to cost containment whilst trying as far as possible to mitigate the impact on output and programming.  I acknowledge that both RT&Eacute; and TG4 have been proactive in this regard but the efforts must be maintained and indeed intensified.</p></reply>

Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg&#8217;s website at .</p><p>  In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.  It aimed to bring an affordable, scalable broadband service to certain designated rural areas where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be inadequate.</p><p>  Prior to the commencement of the NBS a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to determine those areas that would be included in the Scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.  EU State aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas in which commercial service providers already operate.  Accordingly, the NBS is restricted to providing a basic service and is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  That mapping exercise found that the general area of Ballynacargy in County Westmeath was already served by existing service providers and consequently was excluded from the Scheme.</p><p>  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&#8217;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  One of the first steps in delivering on the commitments in the Plan will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Ballynacargy, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

The Charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge.</p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge and late payment fees due to it, and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Guidelines have also been issued to local authorities in relation to the provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which address matters including the collection, care and management of the Charge, and the operation of exemptions.  I expect local authorities to implement these guidelines appropriately.  I have no plans to introduce an amnesty on the Non-Principal Private Residence charge and I urge all liable persons who have not paid the Charge to contact their local authority as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

Work on the review is almost complete and I intend to issue a policy statement on homelessness shortly.  That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</p><p>  However, much progress has been made in otherwise implementing the strategy including <i>inter alia</i>: the publication of a detailed Implementation Plan in April 2009, which set out a range of priority actions to be undertaken to deliver on the six strategic aims of the Strategy; new legislative provisions in the Housing Act 2009 that came into force on 1 February 2010, which put Homelessness Fora and Homelessness Action Plans on a statutory basis, and are now being implemented at regional and local level; the adoption in 2010 by the 34 City and County Councils of their statutory Homelessness Action Plans; annual provision of current funding to provide for sufficient bed capacity to accommodate all those in need of emergency accommodation nationwide and to deliver on the commitment to eliminate the need for persons to involuntarily sleep rough; the on-going reconfiguration of existing emergency or transitional homeless facilities to provide a substantial number of secure long-term tenancies for homeless persons; the development of a scheme,<i> Support to Live Independently,</i> to provide visiting supports for persons leaving homelessness which assists people to progress from homelessness to independent living in mainstream housing and forms an important element of follow up action to end long-term homelessness, by co-ordinating appropriate tenancy and other supports to meet each individuals&#8217; needs in their local community setting; and the new homelessness on-line data and bed management system, PASS, which is operational in Dublin and is being extended nationally on a phased basis with work currently underway in other regions.</p><p>  The National Implementation Plan for the Homeless Strategy also provides for the development of a more devolved allocation-based system for the provision of accommodation-related funding to housing authorities with emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency, value for money and greater local decision making in homeless services.  A Protocol has been put in place with Dublin City Council to provide delegation of responsibility in relation to the management of homelessness funding.  Similar arrangements are being put in place in respect of the other statutory homelessness regions.</p><p>  My Department&#8217;s current funding provision for the running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2012 is &#8364;50 million, which, together with 10% provided from housing authorities&#8217; own resources, brings the total available funding to &#8364;55.55 million in 2012.  It is my intention to inform housing authorities of their homeless funding following the announcement of the Estimates for 2013.  I will seek to ensure that the necessary funding will be available to the maximum extent possible, having regard to the current pressures on the public finances.</p></reply>

The Household Charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge. </p><p>  There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced. The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property and will be an essential component for implementing the Local Property Tax. Local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data. </p><p>  I understand that the addresses and names used in the batch of letters which have been issued by Local Authorities in recent weeks reminding people to pay the Household Charge have been based on a data matching exercise with the Property Registration Authority. </p><p>  I also understand that every effort has been made to try and ensure letters are sent to current property owners. However there are some instances where letters are being sent to previous owners of properties, due to the fact that the more recent property owners may not have registered their property with the Authority or the transfer of the property has not been completed. Thus in some cases the information contained within these datasets may not reflect the most recent and relevant details. As a consequence, the data matching exercise can give rise to situations in which people may receive a letter where they have already paid the Charge. Due to differences in the formats of addresses between datasets, it has also been the case that some owners who have paid the Charge are receiving reminder letters.</p><p>  In the absence of a comprehensive database, such instances, while regrettable, are also unavoidable if the Agency and local authorities are to continue their work in maximising compliance with a charge which funds essential local services for communities.</p><p>  I understand that the letters which issued in recent weeks invite recipients who are not liable, or who have previously paid the household charge, or in the event of inaccuracy or error, to contact the Household Charge Bureau to allow the Agency to update their records accordingly.</p></reply>

This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is no requirement to consult with other bodies when contemplating a revision of these or other fees. Moreover, it is difficult to see what useful purpose would be served by such an exercise as it is unlikely that affected parties or their representatives would signal support for such an increase. The fee was first introduced in 2006 and was then set at &euro;100. It was increased to &euro;150 in 2008 and has remained at that level until the latest increase came into effect on 19 November, 2012.</p><p>  The introduction of the registration fee in May, 2006 resulted from a policy decision that the fee income was required for the ongoing development of immigration services (both in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Our migrant population have made a valuable contribution to the economic, cultural and social life of Ireland and will continue to do so. However, I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask those who benefit from the immigration system to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of services and particularly so in a time when we are seeking to reduce public expenditure.  It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services; in some instances these may be set at a level above the estimated direct administrative cost of the service based on the value of the service.  By comparison with many jurisdictions the current registration fee represents very good value.</p><p>  I am also very conscious of the need to maintain and develop good service levels to customers. In this regard the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  These include the introduction of a new common format EU Residence Permit for non-nationals which will replace the current registration certificate. It will provide the user with a more secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State. This high quality secure document will be easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies.</p><p>  Furthermore, INIS as part of its reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, is developing a range of measures including on line application and appointment systems for certain services. Such a service is badly needed, but it does cost money to implement. The nature of immigration requirements such as registration necessitates, to a very great extent, the personal attendance of the applicant. At certain times of the year this can give rise to long queues and significant delays. A self-selecting on-line system will help to greatly alleviate these difficulties and the increased registration fee income will be used to meet a portion of the cost involved in this and other developments.</p><p>  Other projects being progressed are proposals for the civilianisation of certain port of entry functions at Dublin Airport. For this purpose, a trial is underway at Dublin airport to test the feasibility of a new model for delivery of immigration services at ports of entry to the State by using a combination of civilian staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I refer the Deputy to my answer to D&aacute;il Question No. 171 of 4th October, 2012 which sets out the latest position in respect of this project.</p><p>  In recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following:</p><p>- UN Convention Refugees;</p><p>- Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section  18 of the Refugee Act 1996;</p><p>- Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration;</p><p>- Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens;</p><p>- Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38/04;</p><p>- Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996;</p><p>- Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.</p><p>  The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering. Last year alone, this amounted to 21, 443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived.</p></reply>

The person referred to by the Deputy has been the subject of a number of court proceedings over the past decade including criminal charges and proceedings to freeze assets brought under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996.

The term overholder is used to describe former members of the Defence Forces and their families who have refused to leave married quarters within 15 days of leaving the Defence Forces. There are 36 married quarters currently being occupied by overholders in the Curragh Camp, County Kildare. The duration of overholding ranges from 44 years to 8 months with the majority overholding between 20 to 30 years.  The issue of overholders  is being addressed in a number of ways.  Since 2010 with the assistance of the Chief State Solicitors Office formal procedures have been put in place to ensure that occupants of married quarters  are made aware of their responsibilities to vacate properties. This facilitates the initiation of proceedings to obtain vacant possession of the properties from those who have retired since 2010.</p><p>  Overholders if they are in receipt of a pension or gratuity pay additional charges for married quarters which is deducted at source.</p><p>  Since 1997 properties outside of Barracks are offered for sale to tenants with over 150 sold since the scheme was introduced. </p><p>  In a small number of cases people have been being granted continued occupancy of the properties for the remainder of their lives with formal leases being put in place.</p><p>  The securing of alternative housing is a matter for the individuals concerned in the first instance.  If personnel are not in a position to secure housing in their own right they must make application to their local authority outlining their requirements.  In recent years the Department has had meetings with Kildare County Council to discuss the issue of the continued occupation of married quarters by former members of the Defence Forces. Kildare County Council has informed the Department that the overholders must be registered on their housing list before any consideration can be given to providing accommodation for them.   My Department is available to assist whenever possible in ensuring that the authorities are aware of the requirements of individuals when vacating military quarters.

My Department has scaled down the brucellosis testing programme since then, as follows: the age threshold for annual round testing has been increased from 12 to 24 months; only 20% of dairy herds and 50% of non-dairy herds are required to be tested this year for the round test; the validity period of the pre-movement test has been increased from 30 days to 60 days; the age-limit for the pre-movement test for female animals has been increased from 12 to 18 months and, in view of the lower risk attached to their movement, to 24 months for bulls.</p><p>  All of the above changes have reduced the number of animals to be tested from 4.7m in 2008 to 1.8m this year, with significant benefits to farmers in terms of reduced testing costs, estimated at approximately &euro;10m per annum.  I will be taking a decision shortly about the testing arrangements for 2013 and the age limit for the pre-movement test will be considered in this context. However, I will continue to adopt a cautious approach in view of the fact that Brucellosis is still present in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

In advance of the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency, work is ongoing regarding the disaggregation of the Children and Families resource base from the HSE. Consequently the number of social workers assigned to the Children and Families Service area will be subject to change as the mapping/classification of posts into care groups is further refined between now and year end.</p><p>  The HSE has made considerable progress over recent years in recruiting additional social workers, with 260 social workers recruited under the Ryan Implementation Plan at end 2011 as had been committed to. A further 10 social worker posts which were to be recruited after 2011 are currently at various stages of recruitment, with the first four already in position. The National Director of Children and Family Services, Gordon Jeyes, will continue to apply his discretion to the filling of social work vacancies, taking account of identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.</p></reply>

Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children&#8217;s mental health services by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.  Of the 414 posts approved to implement the &#8364;35 million package, 150 will be allocated to Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams of which 3 posts are filled and 84 posts have been accepted and candidates are currently going through the clearance  processes.  It is hoped that the bulk of the appointments will be made by the end of the year.  It is envisaged that the completion of the multidisciplinary profile of current teams will help progress the expansion of CAMHS to all up to 18 years and reduce the waiting lists for this service. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the HSE has recently finalised &quot;<i>Access Protocols for 16 and 17 year olds to Mental Health Services</i>&quot; and these have been approved by the Management Team and will come into effect from 1 January next. <b><i></i></b>  In an effort to ensure that children are treated in an age appropriate manner, the new protocol provides that from 1 January 2013, CAMHS will at least accept referrals of all new cases of children up to their 17th birthday, and from 1 January 2014 or earlier where feasible CAMHS will accept referrals of all new cases of children up to their 18th birthday.  Some of the teams are already accepting children up to 18, of which some can only do so on a case by case basis, but all teams continue to see open cases beyond their 16th birthday.  The additional resources currently coming on stream will advance progress in this area. </p></reply>

Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Education and Skills to address the needs of those affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination.  Meetings have been held by myself and my Department with representatives of the support group Suffers of Unique Narcolepsy Disorder (SOUND).</p><p>  The HSE provides a range of services and supports to those affected including access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place have commenced. The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected. </p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills has also held a number of meetings with SOUND to outline the range of educational supports which may be provided for children with narcolepsy, subject to an assessment of their needs.  These supports can include special arrangements at state exams, access to Special Needs Assistant support, additional learning assistance in schools, information for schools regarding this condition, and home tuition support for children who have missed a significant time in school due to illness. </p><p>  A meeting was recently held between  SOUND and representatives from the Higher Education Authority National  Access Office and the Department of Education Higher Education Unit, in relation  to assistance which may be  made for young adults with narcolepsy in Third Level education. Students with  Narcolepsy may access the  Disability Access  Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which offers  enhanced access routes to third level education for pupils with disabilities.  Support can also be provided to pupils in colleges through the Disability  Officers at third level colleges.  The Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) group, which works to promote full access to and  participation in further and higher education for students with disabilities and  to enhance their employment prospects on graduation, will also provide  assistance to SOUND in relation to these matters.  </p><p>   The Department is considering all other possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected.

However, given overall Government policy on reducing employment numbers and pay costs, such appointments may be made only within employment ceiling and budget.</p><p>  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline services of the reduction in employment numbers and retirements, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system. Therefore, the HSE is using the provisions of the Public Service Agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, redeployment and other changes to achieve more efficient delivery of services. </p><p>  On 20 November, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that he had invited members of the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on a new agenda for improvements in the productivity of public servants and reductions in the cost of delivery of public services. One of the key objectives in this process will be to further enable the health services to provide the maximum level of safe services in the context of the necessary further reductions in staffing numbers in the next number of years.</p><p>  The Deputy's query regarding expenditure on agency staff and equivalent staff numbers is a service matter and, as such, has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO), has recommended the introduction of a Sugar Sweetened Drinks tax as a priority action.
