    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-27a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1074" speakername="Michael Ring" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062700054#WRA01000"><p>This question relates to the extension of the reduced VAT rate of 9% beyond the end of this year.    I am very conscious that the tourism and hospitality industry would like to see the rate continued through 2014 and beyond.</p><p>  I am also conscious that it has been estimated by the Department of Finance that the VAT reduction costs the Exchequer up to &euro;350 million a year.  In that context, I am supportive of retaining a reduced rate, but that can only be justified on the basis of clear evidence of the impact of the reduction. </p><p>  In this regard, an examination of the VAT rate cut by the Department of Finance in late 2012 found that employment among accommodation and food providers increased by 6,200 from the second quarter of 2011 to the equivalent period in 2012.  This amounted to an 8-9% increase in employment in the sector when compared to the decline in overall market services employment (excluding accommodation and food and public sector employment) in that period.  It also found that inflation in the sector lagged the overall trend.</p><p>  More recently, the VAT cut has also helped improve perceptions of value amongst our overseas visitors.  When the percentage of people who had a negative perception of our value for money is subtracted from those with a positive perception, the figures have improved dramatically since 2009. 2009 had a negative rating of -11% and 2012 was +24%.  Other positive indicators include hotel occupancy rates which were at their highest in 2012 since 2007 with a noticeable jump between 2011 and 2012 from 56% to 61%. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the final decision regarding matter of taxation policy is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-27a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062700054#WRA01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 70 together.</p><p>  These questions relate to the current financial position of  the CIE Group.</p><p>  Since 2008 , the financial performance of CI&Eacute; has been severely affected by the economic recession which has resulted in a significant reduction in passenger numbers. CI&Eacute; recorded total losses in the three years 2009 to 2011 of over &euro;137m. The current CIE business plan 2013-2017 provides for almost break even by 2015 and a return to profitability of the Group thereafter.</p><p>  To compensate for the reduced passenger revenues and PSO subvention, CI&Eacute; have engaged in a cost recovery programme over recent years. Further cost saving measures have now been agreed with Bus &Eacute;ireann unions and the Labour Court has recently issued a recommendation in relation to the proposed cost reduction plan in Dublin Bus. The Labour Relations Committee has also facilitated discussions between unions and management at Irish Rail on further cost saving measures and recently issued its proposals.</p><p>  In July 2012 the Government approved an increase in the 2012 subvention to CIE by &euro;36 million to &euro;278 million to ensure that the companies could continue to operate PSO services for the rest of 2012. Given the pressure on the public finances there will be no additional funding from the Exchequer in 2013. The implementation of a credible business plan will therefore be essential to CIE's financial recovery in the period ahead.</p><p>  The Board of CI&Eacute; are pursuing a range of measures to address the financial position.  At the end of 2012 a significant voluntary severance programme was implemented in Irish Rail and the Group generated cash of &euro;20 million by selling its interest in the ground lease in Spencer Dock.  CI&Eacute; will also benefit from the introduction of a fuel rebate in July and in addition, the Group has benefitted from fare increases approved by the NTA. The Group has recently negotiated improved bank facilities in relation to refinancing of the Group, which will ensure that the Group has sufficient funding into the future.</p></reply>

The contract for the Heritage Works Contract is scheduled for award shortly and initial works are planned for September 2013. Works on the Utility Diversions Contract are also planned to commence in September 2013. Procurement for the main contract will commence in mid-2014 with main construction works due to start in early 2015. The target date for commencement of services is end-2017.</p><p>  The NTA are consulting with business representatives in the Dawson Street area with regard to the re-instatement of a northbound stop on Dawson Street. A report on possible locations for a proposed stop is expected to be available in late-July 2013.</p><p>  The new project will create up to 800 jobs during the construction phase with a further 60 permanent jobs on completion. A breakdown by year is not available.</p><p>  There are no plans in the current Capital Programme to further extend the Luas lines. However, the NTA is currently preparing an Integrated Implementation Plan for investment to 2018 in the GDA as required under the DTA Act 2008. This plan will address the investment needs of the Area to 2018 based on available funding and will be subject to public consultation later this year.</p></reply>

The findings of that report are being considered.</p><p>  The support of other sporting organisations would be an important element in the bid process and I am pleased to note that on 23 March delegates at the GAA Congress approved a motion which would allow the inclusion of Croke Park and other GAA grounds in the list of venues that would be used for matches if Ireland was selected as the host country for the tournament.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment that event tourism will be prioritised in order to continue to bring major events to Ireland. As well as the primary purpose of bringing spectators to our shores, the hosting of sports events can provide a great showcase for Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the holding of sports and other events that can boost tourism and, where appropriate, will provide advice and assistance to the sporting body which is seeking to secure an international event.  I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has engaged with the IRFU in this regard and are considering the likely tourism impact of hosting the tournament. </p><p>  The bid has also been discussed with the Northern Ireland Minister for Tourism, Arlene Foster MLA, and Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA. They have met with the IRFU and  have also indicated their support for a bid.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-27a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062700054#WRA02300"><p>This question is about cruise ship tourism.</p><p>  The cruise ship sector has seen significant growth in recent years and is a sector that has considerable potential to contribute to the growth of the overall tourism sector in Ireland.  In April 2013 the Irish Maritime Development Office published figures for 2012 which show a 14.5% increase in the number of large cruise vessel calls to the island of Ireland. Based on expected visits to Irish ports this summer, it is expected that there will be a further increase in cruise vessel calls in 2013.</p><p>  The Government's Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland includes an action to investigate opportunities to increase Ireland's share of the cruise tourism market and develop Ireland as a turnaround destination, including supporting port companies in their plans to develop or expand cruise facilities using their own resources.</p><p>  In line with this a number of port companies are developing proposals to facilitate greater volumes and provide better cruise related facilities within ports. All these developments have to be funded commercially by the port companies themselves as there is no scope for Exchequer financing under State Aid rules. </p><p>  It is important to recognise that the nature of the cruise industry is that is not a lucrative source of revenue for port companies and that it can be difficult for investments in this area to remunerate themselves from the charges the ports levy. However, such visits provide considerable benefit for the local and wider regional economy. Therefore in the context of the proposed development of larger scale cruise facilities, it is appropriate for each port company to consider whether they can fund these developments from their own resources on a commercial basis and if not, if those beneficiaries of cruise tourism, be they regional interests or the cruise operators, can contribute to development costs.</p><p>  In relation to the further development of cruise tourism, the matters raised are of an operational nature and are for consideration by F&aacute;ilte Ireland. I have referred the Deputy's question to the agency for further information and direct reply. Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

As I pointed out in my replies to D&aacute;il Question Nos.  7 and 63 on 15th  May last, work on the preparation of the Heads of a Bill to provide for the merger of the Shannon Airport Authority (SAA) and a restructured Shannon Development is on-going in my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and with the assistance of the Attorney General's Office.</p><p>  I expect to introduce the Bill to the House during the autumn session.  When the Heads are finalised and approved by Government, I will refer them to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport for their consideration prior to drafting.</p><p>  Of course, the plans and preparations for the merger are continuing and I am very satisfied with progress  to date by the newly independent Shannon Airport Authority (SAA).</p><p>  As I pointed out last month, the high-level Steering Group of key Departments continues to meet on a regular basis and the Chairman of SAA serves on this group. Transition teams at senior management level are also in situ in both Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development to ensure the smooth implementation and management of the merger while also ensuring that normal day-to-day business and operations carry on uninterrupted. </p><p>  Following the successful conclusion last month of a facilitation process between management and union representatives in Shannon Development to address a number of staff issues, staff transfers from that company have commenced to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  Some staff are also being redeployed to other agencies in the region.  A voluntary early retirement and voluntary redundancy scheme was also successfully concluded last month in Shannon Development with 25 staff availing of the scheme.</p><p>The new Chief Executive of the Shannon Airport Authority and of the proposed new Shannon entity took up his post on 10th   June and the key priority for him and the board of SAA is to halt the decline in passenger traffic, and then reverse it.</p><p>  I am confident that Shannon can have a successful long-term sustainable future, now that the board and management are free to determine that future themselves.</p><p>  As regards the travel tax, the Government&rsquo;s offer to abolish this tax in return for an increase in capacity and the restoration of cancelled routes and reduced capacity stands. The purpose of the offer was to stimulate inbound tourist traffic. While there have been some positive developments in relation to additional capacity in 2013, particularly on US-Ireland routes, linked to both general traffic demand and the expected increased traffic relating to the Gathering, overall the response from the airlines to date has been inadequate. The Government has made it clear that it will need to see a significant growth in capacity and routes across the full range of sectors and airports before consideration can be given to abolishing the tax.  </p><p>  In relation to the development of air connections to Ireland, the three State airports offer a range of incentive schemes to airlines to maintain and grow their business at those airports. This includes the Growth Incentive Scheme which was introduced as part of the Government's Jobs Initiative aimed at encouraging inbound tourism.  Under this Scheme, a total of &euro;1.5m was rebated by the DAA to airlines in 2012 for increasing their passenger numbers during the year.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits my Department to invest in the National Cycling Policy Framework.  Objective 8 of this policy framework is to ensure proper integration between cycling and public transport, with a specific action to provide for the carriage of bicycles on LUAS when services are of a frequency and at a capacity that allows for it, that is when they do not interfere with the capacity for passengers. </p><p>  The Railway Procurement Authority considered the carriage of bicycles in 2012 as part of a review of all Luas operations. They concluded that bicycles could not be carried on Luas trams, because, for the most part, bicycles would interfere with the capacity for passengers, particularly those who are mobility impaired.  </p><p>  Folded bicycles may be carried on the trams at all times.</p><p>  My Department is currently reviewing the National Cycling Policy Framework and as part of this exercise has re-opened the issue of the carriage of bicycles on LUAS with the RPA.  Consultation with the RPA on this matter is on-going.</p><p>  It should be noted that while the RPA has not permitted the carriage of bicycles on trams they have provided over 750 secure bike parking places along the LUAS routes to enable LUAS passengers to &lsquo;bike and ride&rsquo;.</p><p>  With regard to carriage of bicycles on other public transport modes, Irish Rail allows bicycles to be carried on intercity trains at all times and on DART and other commuter services during the off-peak period.</p></reply>

There is a healthy competitive market for air services in and out of the country and we benefit from a wide range of air connections, both short and long haul. New routes are being announced on a regular basis by both Irish and international airlines. Maintaining and developing this connectivity is certainly a key objective of national aviation policy.</p><p>  A consultation process to develop a new national aviation policy is currently underway. An issues paper was published on 1 March this year inviting submissions from stakeholders and interested parties. The deadline for submissions has recently been extended to 12 July in response to a number of requests. I anticipate that all the major airlines and airports will have substantial contributions to make to the consultation process. They each have a role to play in maximising options and opportunities for the development of the aviation sector.  I look forward to receiving their submissions along with the views of all interested parties.</p><p>  Following receipt of submissions, a draft National Aviation Policy Statement will be issued in the second half of 2013. This will provide further opportunity for stakeholder input before the adoption of the new policy document in early 2014. The new policy will outline the actions to be taken by Government to help sustain and develop the aviation sector, in order to create jobs and support business and tourism.</p><p>  In relation to the State's remaining shareholding in Aer Lingus, the Government continues to seek opportunities to dispose of the shareholding, but will only do so when market conditions are favourable and on terms and at a price that are acceptable. In the meantime the Government will continue to manage its shareholding actively to protect the State's interests and with the aim of maximising the value of the shareholding, securing dividends and encouraging new routes and additional capacity where commercially viable.</p><p>  In relation to Cork airport questions regarding the development of routes and operating costs are day to day operational matters for the DAA and local management. I recently met with management at Cork Airport and welcomed their plans for the development of the Airport and for enhanced consultation by them with regional stakeholders.</p></reply>

For example, I am aware that the Group has already carried out an initial examination,  including a survey of industry, of how the airport can best serve Industry needs and support economic development in its catchment area. However, it is recognised that a substantial body of work needs to be carried out before the Group can complete its report.</p><p>  Following the conclusion of a tender process, the Study Group has selected Ernst &amp;amp; Young consultants to assist the Group in part of their work.  This consultancy will be jointly funded by my Department, Mayo County Council and the airport.  The consultants have been asked to develop scenarios for a secure financially viable future for IWAK.</p><p>  The IWAK Study Group expects to submit a report to myself and to the Taoiseach by Autumn 2013.</p></reply>

The general guideline figure is 30% of after-tax profits. Depending on the financial circumstances of the particular company, the figure adopted may be more or less than this guideline 30% figure.  However, dividend policies will need to take account of issues such as current and projected profitability, capital investment plans and pension funding.  I have reviewed the capacity of all the commercial State companies under my Department&rsquo;s responsibility to pay a dividend in line with this policy. Many of these companies are not currently profitable and are not therefore in a position to pay.  The capacity to pay dividends in 2013 in any material way is therefore limited to a small number of the larger and profitable State companies, specifically Dublin Port Company, the Irish Aviation Authority and the Port of Cork. A dividend has also been secured from Aer Lingus.</p></reply>

The bulk of this funding will go towards renewals and maintenance under the Railway Safety Programme, and enhancement projects such as signalling, the provision of automated ticketing facilities and the removal of level-crossings.</p><p>  The investment regime for Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann for 2014 is currently being reviewed having regard to the anticipated completion of the Railway Safety Programme by the end of 2013 and new EU mandated infrastructure management contract requirements, allied to the need to ensure value for money in the spending of constrained Exchequer funding.</p><p>  The European Commission announced a package of proposals last January aimed at delivering a better quality and more choice in railway services across Europe. Among the proposals announced is the opening of domestic rail passenger markets from 2019 onwards. The package also contains a proposal that would lead to all public services obligation contracts being awarded by means of a competitive tender process from December 2019.</p><p>The discussions on these latest proposals have not commenced. I have therefore not yet taken a position. The proposals are being scrutinised by my Department and the approach to be taken will have regard to the views of interested parties.</p></reply>

It is intended to initiate a new funding call under the NCN Programme later this year to provide, through competitive process, a further tranche of funding for the remainder of the years to 2016.  As part of this competitive process, it would be a matter for Meath County Council to progress and submit proposals to the Department for the development of cycle projects in Co. Meath, including any proposal to develop a Boyne Greenway.</p></reply>

The importance of ensuring the provision of search and rescue response capability is also vital.</p><p>  I am currently considering the need for a new national maritime safety strategy and how such a strategy could be progressed in an integrated way for the sector. I expect to complete this consideration shortly. The focus of this strategy will be on the development of a culture of safety amongst seafarers and the crucial role of regulation and enforcement, particularly in relation to vessel inspection and certification as well as the certification and training of seafarers.</p><p>  Recent tragedies occurring in the fishing industry and leisure activities on the water reinforce the need for continued vigilance with regard to safety on the water across the recreational, fishing and maritime industry generally. The Government supports enhancements to existing safety initiatives designed to promote a culture of water safety and prevent further loss of life and serious injury.  In March, a programme of visits to Primary Schools by Coast Guard Units got underway to promote a greater awareness of water safety among children during school holidays in the summer months.  In April, the Marine Safety Working Group of the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport updated and re-launched its website safetyonthewater.ie to provide safety advice and guidance to all involved in the maritime domain. On 12 June the Irish Coast Guard launched its new 'Stay Safe on the Water' TV advertising campaign aimed at families, leisure users and the fishing industry during the busy summer months.</p><p>  In July, I and my colleague Minister Coveney will launch a joint initiative targeting increased safety in the fishing industry, concentrating on an integrated package of measures including mandatory training and grant aid for mandatory safety equipment. These measures are designed to enhance safety for fishermen and promote a culture of high safety standards within the industry.</p></reply>

Among the primary matters addressed by the consultants was the level of resourcing necessary to deliver the broad range of services demanded nationally and internationally of the Irish maritime administration.      </p><p>  For the purposes of identifying the most suitable model for operating a national Coast Guard facility within limited resources, a supplementary review was undertaken earlier this year specifically focussed on Coast Guard operations and reflective of the existing staff profile including potential retirements.</p><p>  One of the consultants' key recommendations was that the option of a 2 centre model for rescue coordination centres should be pursued in lieu of retaining the current 3 centre model.  After careful consideration of all the various options presented I decided to maintain the three centres model. To that end, I asked my Department to examine the most appropriate way of maintaining this model given the current economic climate and utilising the assistance of a modern integrated communications and IT infrastructure.  I expect to conclude very shortly on our overall response to  the various deficiencies raised in the reviews which will include the level of staffing necessary to maintain a three centre Coast Guard model. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-27a.165.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062700058#WRE01100"><p>The Minister for Finance recently announced the drafting of a Bill to, inter alia, establish the Ireland Strategic Infrastructures Fund (ISIF).  Once established the ISIF will invest in the Irish economy on commercial terms in support of economic activity and employment.  It is difficult to create projects under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that are commercial. That is, projects that produce a revenue stream that can be used to repay the ESIF.  To date, the only mechanism we have used are Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). This mechanism has been used for major new road projects. It can also be used for large scale public transport projects as well. Unfortunately doing so for projects that have a cost of less that &euro;100 million (which would cover the vast majority of envisaged tourism and sports projects) is uneconomic and direct exchequer investment is preferred for those projects.</p><p>  In line with this overall approach three road projects have been included in the Government's Infrastructure Stimulus package announced in July 2012 - the N17/N18 Gort to Tuam PPP together with the N25 New Ross Bypass and the N11 Gorey to Enniscorthy PPP.  In addition under the investment plan announced recently by the Government an additional &euro;50million has been made available to fund maintenance and repair work on regional and local roads.</p><p>  The general approach I have taken is to keep under review projects at various stages of planning and design which have been evaluated and appraised with a view to having a pipeline of suitable &quot;shovel ready&quot; projects ready to avail of any funding opportunities that may arise.  I have also put considerable emphasis on the need to direct resources to the maintenance and repair of existing infrastructure.  Should further funding become available in the future my aim will be to develop a balanced package of measures covering infrastructure maintenance, safety schemes and targeted development projects across the transport sector to<font color="#333333"> ensure that available resources are maximised to generate economic activity and create jobs in Ireland.</font></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-27a.180.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062700059#WRF00300"><p>As explained in my reply to the Deputy's PQ No. 61 of 18 June, a judge is elected to serve on the Court in respect of each High Contracting Party (state party) to the ECHR, although judges sit on the Court in their individual capacity. The judges are elected by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) from a list of three candidates nominated by a state party. In the time available, it is not possible to provide the lists of candidates put forward by Ireland for election to the European Court of Human Rights on each occasion since the Court was established in 1959. However, I set out below the lists of three candidates nominated for election to the Court since it was established on a full-time basis on 1 November 1998, pursuant to Protocol 11 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  Ireland has submitted lists of candidates in respect of three elections to the full-time Court - in 1997, 2004 and 2007. Details of the lists of candidates put forward are as follows:</p><p>1997 (in advance of the setting up of the full time Court) </p><p>Mr. John Hedigan S.C. (elected in January 1998)</p><p>Mr. Gerard Hogan S.C.</p><p>Mr. Denis Vaughan Buckley S.C.</p><p>2004 (in advance of the expiry of Judge Hedigan's first term of office)</p><p>Judge John Hedigan  (re-elected in April 2004)</p><p>Professor Fionnuala N&iacute; Aol&aacute;in</p><p>Mr. Roger Sweetman S.C. </p><p>(on the resignation of Judge Hedigan)</p><p>Mr. David Keane B.L.</p><p>Ms Ann Power S.C. (elected in January 2008)</p><p>Mr. Roger Sweetman S.C.</p><p>  The ECHR sets out certain criteria required of judges of the European Court of Human Rights, including the requirement to be of high moral character and to possess the qualifications required for appointment to high judicial office or to be jurisconsults of recognised competence. In addition to this, PACE has adopted a number of texts on the standards to be adhered to by states in preparing the list of three candidates. I would refer the Deputy to an information document (reference AS/Jur/Inf (2013)02 10 January 2013) prepared by the Council of Europe Secretariat for<b></b>the Parliamentary Assembly Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the PACE on the procedure for electing judges to the European Court of Human Rights which lists the relevant texts and includes information on its own procedures. This document is available on the Council of Europe website at: <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.</p><p>  In preparing lists of candidates, states are expected, amongst other things: to issue public and open calls for candidatures; to transmit the names of candidates in alphabetical order rather than in order of preference; to ensure that candidates possess an active knowledge of one and a passive knowledge of the other official language of the Council of Europe (French and English); and, as a general rule, to ensure that the list of candidates includes both women and men. </p><p>Although it has no formal role under the ECHR, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has adopted measures seeking to ensure that only high quality candidates are put forward by Governments for election to the Court. In 2010 the Committee set up an Advisory Panel of experts on candidates for election as judges to the Court. The Panel's role is to advise states parties on whether the candidates that they propose to nominate to PACE for election meet the criteria set out in the ECHR. On 28 March 2012 the Committee of Ministers also adopted Guidelines on the selection of candidates for the post of judge at the European Court of Human Rights, together with an Explanatory Memorandum identifying good practices. The Guidelines support the standards laid down by the PACE and deal with the criteria for the establishment of lists of candidates; the procedure for eliciting candidates; the procedure for drawing up the recommended list of candidates and the finalisation of lists of candidates. These are available on the Council of Europe website at: <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i> and<b></b>.</p><p>  In submitting its list of three candidates, Ireland has ensured that it has complied with the evolving standards set down by the Council of Europe. In 2007, the nominations procedure included a public newspaper advertisement, an advertisement on my Department's website and a notice informing the judiciary, the legal professions and universities of the vacancy.  A review of all applications was conducted by an expert panel created by the Attorney General to assist him in recommending the three most suitable candidates to the Government. The decision on the submission of the three candidates was taken by Government on foot of a Memorandum submitted by my predecessor. PACE has commended the quality of the candidates put forward for election in respect of Ireland by the Government and the Committee of Ministers has cited Ireland in its Memorandum on Good Practices.  </p></reply>

This figure represents a significant reduction in staff numbers compared with an equivalent figure of 1,572 from March 2009 - a loss of a total of 224 or approximately one in every seven posts since the introduction of the moratorium on recruitment.  In common with all others, my Department has already sustained heavy losses under the moratorium.  Permanent Departmental staff numbers have fallen by 190, or about 12%, since 2009.  </p><p>  In order to try to ameliorate the impact of the ongoing reductions in staffing, a major re-structuring of the Department&rsquo;s Headquarters operations was completed earlier last year.  Other functions and staff are routinely reorganized or reallocated to maximize continuity of work output and minimize disruption to service delivery to the citizen.  This, of course, places additional pressure on individual officers.  </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Employment Control Framework restrictions apply equally to Irish Missions and it has therefore not been possible during the period in question to accommodate requests for additional permanent posts.  In fact, it proved necessary to close three Missions during 2012 and a number of others have been downsized.  By way of example, a total of 8 Missions now have only one Diplomatic Officer assigned from Headquarters.</p><p>  However, in recognition of added responsibilities and tasks arising from Ireland&rsquo;s Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2012 and our current Presidency of the European Union, some 38 temporary posts at Missions were sanctioned and filled since 1 January 2012, most notably in the Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels.  In addition, 5 temporary staff were employed on short contracts to cover short-term vacancies or where replacements for departing permanent staff could not be sanctioned, and 4.5 posts previously filled by staff from Headquarters were filled by local recruitment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-27a.192.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062700059#WRF01100"><p>I attended the most recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on Monday 24 June.As you will be aware, the Council had a very busy agenda;  the final Council Conclusions agreed may be accessed on the official EU website <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.  Before dealing in detail with the outcome of the meeting, I should mention that the Council adopted new Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, and Guidelines to promote and protect the enjoyment of all human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI).  Advances on these important issues are to be welcomed at any time but I am particularly pleased that both sets of Guidelines, which were priority concerns for Ireland, were adopted at the final Council meeting of the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  The first item on the agenda at Monday's meeting was the Eastern Partnership.   Ministers took stock of preparations for an Eastern Partnership Ministerial meeting scheduled for Brussels in July and for the Eastern Partnership Summit that will take place in Vilnius in November.  A progress report was presented on the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) Agreements with Armenia, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine was presented.    Ministers considered developments in the six Eastern Partnership countries and were broadly supportive of the work being done in preparation for the Summit in November.   I expressed the hope that Heads of State and Government would be in a position to take positive decisions at that meeting.</p><p>  Next, the Council discussed EU Climate Diplomacy and   the global cross-cutting challenges which are presented by the impacts of climate change. There was general agreement on the need for Foreign Ministers to consider the strategic and security dimensions of climate change and to avail of opportunities in their contacts with third countries to build support for actions to address these challenges.  In my intervention, I recalled the successful conference on climate change, nutrition and hunger which I co-hosted in Dublin in April.  I also emphasised the importance of pursuing a holistic approach to the climate change agenda.  Preparations for the 2015 UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris are advancing well and the Council expects to return to this issue next year.  Comprehensive Conclusions were adopted which are firmly in line with the Conclusions on Post-2015 which were agreed at the Development Foreign Affairs Council in May. </p><p>  Ministers reviewed recent developments in relation to the Middle East Peace Process  , including current efforts by the US to achieve a resumption of direct negotiations. Following this discussion, HR Ashton reaffirmed the EU's commitment to the two-state solution and full EU support for the US efforts. </p><p>Over lunch, which was attended also by the NATO Secretary General, Ministers discussed the current situation on the ground in Afghanistan   and the prospects in the region, particularly in the context of forthcoming Presidential elections. They examined  political, developmental and security aspects of this issue and Council Conclusions were agreed. The EU is resolutely committed to supporting state-building and long-term development in Afghanistan. </p><p>  After lunch, discussions moved to the Southern Neighbourhood   agenda item. HR Ashton debriefed the Council on her recent visit to several countries in the region. Ministers had an exchange of views on the ongoing crisis in Syria and also had a broad discussion of the effectiveness of the EU's response to the 'Arab Spring' developments. They reiterated the need for a political settlement of the Syrian crisis and discussed how the EU can best maintain pressure on all sides so as to bring about an end to the violence and to secure their engagement in a political process of transition. There was agreement that the Geneva II process is critical.  Following the Council meeting, HR Ashton repeated the EU's firm support for a political solution and noted the EU's commitment to humanitarian assistance in Syria, where the contribution by the EU and its member States is in excess of &euro;1 billion.  Ireland's total contribution to date stands at &euro;9.8 million.</p><p>  Finally, Ministers discussed the Western Balkans, in advance of decisions to be taken at this week's European Council.

The main items on the agenda were the enlargement and stabilisation process; a proposal by some Member States for an initiative on democracy, fundamental values and rule of law; preparation of the European Council of 27/28 June 2013; and the Multiannual Financial Framework. Ministers discussed the next steps for Serbia and Kosovo in the enlargement and stabilisation and association process.  The GAC recommended that, following completion of national parliamentary procedures and subject to the endorsement of the June European Council, accession negotiations be opened with Serbia.  The Council also agreed in principle on draft Council decisions authorising the opening of negotiations for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo.  The Council also agreed to open chapter 22 (on regional policy) with Turkey.   Ministers held a further discussion on the proposal by the Foreign Ministers of four Member States (Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and Finland) for a new and more effective mechanism to safeguard fundamental values in EU Member States.  The GAC will return to this issue after the summer, during the course of the Lithuanian Presidency. </p><p>  Preparations for the European Council meeting of 27/28 June were also discussed at the GAC. Ministers considered the draft European Council conclusions. President Van Rompuy has stated that he intends to make youth unemployment and financing of the economy the focus of the June European Council.  Leaders will also conclude the European Semester 2013 by endorsing country specific recommendations for the forthcoming national budget cycles across the Union; review the Compact for Growth and Jobs, one year on from its adoption; be briefed by President Van Rompuy on the outcome of his consultations on the questions on EMU set by the December 2012 European Council; consider enlargement in light of the debate at the GAC; and note Latvia&rsquo;s application to adopt the Euro as its currency.</p><p>  Finally, I briefed the GAC in detail on the state of play in the discussions between the Irish Presidency and representatives of the European Parliament and of the Commission on the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020.  </p><p>  I expect to provide an overview of the outcome of the June General Affairs Council to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in a statement in July.</p></reply>

A PIP will be involved in Debt Settlement Arrangements and Personal Insolvency Arrangements as provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. It has to be said that a PIP is acting in a capacity not entirely unlike insolvency practitioners, such as, liquidators, receivers or examiners, whose services are also subject to VAT at the standard rate.    Having regard to the activities carried out by a PIP, Revenue has formed the opinion that the service provided by a PIP is not one that qualifies for exemption in accordance with the VAT Directive, Irish VAT Law, and relevant decisions of the European Court of Justice. It should be noted that exemptions for VAT are to be construed strictly and the activities of PIP practitioners do not fall within the exempted activities outlined under paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010. </p><p>  I understand that the position in the UK is that most insolvency services, such as those of liquidators and receivers, are liable to VAT.  However, a VAT exemption is applied to individual voluntary arrangements, company voluntary arrangements, partnership voluntary arrangements and protected trust deeds (applicable only in Scotland.)  The exemption arises from a decision of a UK First Tier VAT Tribunal based on the facts presented before it rather than a government decision.  I am advised by Revenue that there are distinct differences between the activities undertaken by UK practitioners and Irish PIPs and between UK and Irish VAT legislation.  Where a person who is not an official PIP provides services similar to a PIP, such services are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.</p></reply>

It is imposed in such a way that increasing rates of deduction are applied to increasing bands or slices of an affected public servant's pay each year.  The PRD originally became operative on 1 March 2009 as provided for in section 2 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Soon afterwards, the PRD rates and bands were changed by section 13 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009, which, in particular, put in place a zero per cent rate of PRD, effectively an exemption, on the first &euro;15,000 of pay in each year.  A further change in PRD will take place on 1 January 2014, when the PRD rate on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band will fall from 5% to 2.5%, as provided for in section 11 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.</p><p>  Members of pension schemes affected by the 2011 pension fund levy, on the other hand, are not charged with paying the 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets.  The levy is a charge on the trustees of pension schemes and on the insurers and administrators who manage the assets of pension schemes and it is they who are liable to pay the levy.  It is up to those trustees and administrators to decide in each case whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans for which they are responsible.  I have no general information on the decisions taken by trustees and administrators in this regard.</p></reply>

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers.  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position.  Whereas the allocations of SNA support for individual schools may change each year in line with a schools enrolment of children with care needs, there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year.  This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.</p><p>  The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012/13 school year was 10,487 posts.  For the 2011/12 school year it was 10,320 posts.  It is therefore estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year.  In relation to the allocation of resource teaching support for schools from September 2013, demand for support has risen again this year, due to a combination of demographic growth and increased assessments.</p><p>  Despite the fact that the overall number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for allocation to schools had been maintained at existing levels, the allocations announced by the NCSE last week were reduced to take into account of the growth in demand, within the maintained number of posts, in order to ensure that equivalent allocations could be made for all qualifying children.  The Deputy will be aware that I announced recently that I have now authorised the NCSE to retain the level of resource teaching allocations which can be provided for students with special educational needs to the 2012/13 levels.  This will mean that there will not now be any reduction to resource teaching time for children over the level which applied last year.</p><p>  I also committed to ensuring that the resources which will be required to ensure that the allocations can be made to schools at existing levels will be provided, including resources required to meet any late demand expected to arise between now and the start of the school year.  The NCSE will publish revised details of the Resource Teaching allocations for all schools, based on existing allocation levels, and will also advise schools of their revised allocations in the coming days.</p><p>  In the longer term, it is proposed to develop new allocations system to improve how resources for children with special Educational needs are allocated to schools.  I am concerned that the scale of increased demand for resource teachers this year, if it were to continue, would make the current system unsustainable.  I am asking the NCSE to consider the reasons for the unprecedented 12 per cent rise in applications for resource teacher support this year, which compares with an annual 1.3 per cent increase in the number of students attending school in the current year.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools.</p><p>I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p><p>  In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs.  That is why I have made the decision to maintain the existing allocation levels this year.</p></reply>

It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  No charge may be made, however, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p></reply>

The key factors for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level are the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and the pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  However, the staffing schedule also includes provision for schools that have significant increases in their enrolment in rapidly developing areas to be allocated classroom teachers based on their projected enrolments for September 2013.  The criteria for this are set out in the staffing schedule which is available on the Department's website.  I understand the school referred to by the Deputy applied for a post under developing school status.  The post was provisionally approved pending confirmation of the enrolment at 30 September 2013.  The school subsequently decided not to proceed with the post on the basis of uncertainty of achieving the required enrolment.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government protected front-line services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget.  There will no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013-14 school year as a result of the budget.  The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. </p><p>  Details of the resource teaching and SNA allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE for the 2012/2013 and 2013/14 school years are available on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i> and can be viewed on a per county basis. </p><p>  Details of special classes attached to mainstream schools at primary and post primary level on a county by county basis are also available on the NCSE website. Details of any new special classes which will be opened for the coming school year will also be detailed on the NCSE website once this has been finalised. </p><p>  I wish to explain to the Deputy that pupil numbers vary in Special Classes on the basis of the disability categorisation of the special class, which ranges from a 6:1 to 11:1 pupil teacher ratio. It is not possible to provide an actual figure for enrolment levels in special classes, as class numbers can fluctuate throughout the school year as pupils enrol and leave special classes, while in some cases some pupils are partially integrated between special and mainstream classes. </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy also that, since September 2012, the combined resources available for learning support (General Allocation Model at Primary) and language support at both primary and second level have been merged into a single simplified allocation process. Details of these allocations have been published by my Department on a county basis, available at  <i></i>.</p><p>  Regarding the number of pupils requiring additional support at Primary and Post Primary levels, I wish to advise the Deputy that mainstream primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model (GAM) to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs, including mild and borderline mild general learning difficulties. It is a matter for school authorities to determine how these hours are utilised to support eligible pupils. Similar autonomy applies in Post Primary schools in relation to additional teaching allocations in respect of pupils with high incidence special educational needs. My Department therefore does not hold details of the number of pupils being supported through these mechanisms.  </p><p>  I can advise the Deputy, however, that the NCSE has recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students Special Educational Needs in Schools, which contains detailed information regarding the number of pupils with special educational needs being supported in schools, and the number of pupils in receipt of additional supports by disability category.

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability. Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.</p><p>  The allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home. </p><p>  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision. The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals. In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.</p><p>  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations will be considered on a case by case basis. Applications in this regard will require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home.</p><p>  The combined allocation for the siblings referred to by the Deputy can be reviewed if the aforementioned documentation is submitted to support the need for separate allocations. </p></reply>

A second Java Programmer Course with a capacity of 20 places started in January 2013 and is due to finish in October 2013.  In addition a new course is scheduled to start in October 2013 with a capacity of 20 places. </p><p>I also understand from F&Aacute;S that, at present, these 40 places per annum on the Java Programmer Course are meeting the demands in Kerry of both clients and employers. The matter will be kept under review and when the course is further established in Kerry, F&Aacute;S will look at increasing the number of training places if the demand is there.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the reality of our economic situation presents significant challenges that have to be reconciled with limitations on public resources. This is a very stark reality, which, unfortunately, means that changes to any public service, including the student grant scheme, cannot be ruled out.</p><p>  I empathise with students and I am very conscious of the fundamental role played by the student grant scheme in supporting families who are putting their children through further and higher education. However, the state of the public finances is such that tough decisions had to be made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.</p><p>  For this reason it is the responsibility of Government to take into consideration all areas of public services when formulating Budget 2014.  Ultimately, our budgetary decisions now will play a major part in creating a sustainable economy and in regaining our economic independence.As the Deputy will be aware all proposals made in relation to education expenditure including changes to student grants will be considered in the context of the Budget 2014.</p></reply>

The Fund is administered on a local basis by participating higher education institutions and targets those students most in-need. </p><p>  The Fund has increased substantially in recent years, from &euro;5m in 2010-11 to a core allocation of &euro;8m in the most recent academic year (2012-13). During the year, the Higher Education Authority closely monitored local demand for the Fund around the country. Data collected from participating institutions showed a very substantial increase in demand for the Fund compared with the previous year, the outcome of which was a decision by my Department to allocate an additional &euro;3m for 2012-13 as an exceptional measure, bringing the total allocation for the year to &euro;11m.   The Third Level Access Measure also provides for the Fund for Students with Disabilities. A decision will be taken by the HEA in due course in relation to the overall amounts to be allocated under each of the Funds for the forthcoming academic year. Notification to higher education institutions administering the Student Assistance Fund will take place as soon as possible thereafter to support forward planning by those institutions. The HEA will continue to consult with participating institutions on demand for the SAF at local level. The Deputy will appreciate that as the preparation of the Estimates for any Budget, including Budget 2014, is carried out on a strictly confidential basis, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific issues or proposals, including those relating to the Student Assistance Fund, in advance of the Budget announcement.</p></reply>

The advice of my Department's Inspectorate is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published guidelines on the IEP process and a copy issued to all primary and post primary schools at the commencement of the 2006/2007 school year. These guidelines provide advice and assistance to schools, teachers and parents on devising and implementing individual education plans and are available on the NCSE's website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  </p><p>  In addition, schools have been provided with guidance on the IEP process in a number of National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS) publications regarding the continuum model including 'A Continuum of Support for Primary Schools - Guidelines for Teachers', which has been circulated to all schools. </p><p>  The Department's Learning Support Guidelines recommend that an Individual profile and Learning Programme should be devised for all children who are receiving supplementary teaching from the learning-support teacher. Training has been provided to primary and post primary schools by the Special Education Support Services (SESS) in relation to individual education plans.</p><p>  My Department's Inspectorate produced 'Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post-Primary Guidelines' in 2007 which provides advice and guidance to schools on the organisation and co-ordination of resources to maximise the support to each individual student, including guidance on the IEP process.</p><p>  All primary and post primary schools also have access to support and guidance from the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) who can provide additional guidance for schools on the preparation of IEP plans.</p></reply>

As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS). </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that as each child's identified needs should determine the teaching approach and methodology that is to be used. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism. The research evidence is clear that no matter what exclusive approach is followed, its success is limited. Different approaches have been applied successfully with different children, and each approach has been shown to have limitations. This is why my Department does not establish schools to follow an exclusive approach including ABA. </p><p>  My Department's child centred policy is based on advice received from NEPS; the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism and takes full account of advice from a range of experts on autism, including persons with expertise and qualifications in ABA. Advice was sought from international experts on research provided by the IAA and other research on educational interventions for children with autistic spectrum disorders and the advice concluded that research does not support the exclusive usage of ABA or indeed the exclusive use of any other approach, as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs. </p><p> My Department remains willing to review and consider any further research as and when it becomes available and my officials are conscious of the need to adapt existing policies and to develop new policies as new research or learning becomes available. </p><p>  The Department officials who attended the recent briefing referred to by the Deputy have also obtained copies of each of the presentations made by the 3 speakers. I understand the presentations were most informative of the merits and advantages of the ABA model. I am also aware that the presentation was attended by representatives of the National Council for Special Education. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education has a formal role under Section 20.1(j) of EPSEN to advise the Minister 'in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities'. I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. A feature of the preparation of this impartial advice will involve the NCSE consulting widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties. As the NCSE were present at the presentations, I would expect that the information presented upon will be of interest in the context of the preparation of the policy advice.  </p><p>  The NCSE have commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice. Accordingly it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015. </p><p>  My officials are not aware of a recent invitation from the Psychology Society of Ireland's Division of Behaviour Analysis to meet with them to provide a more accurate understanding of ABA.</p></reply>

A circular setting out the regulations and procedures of that scheme issued in June 2012.  The scheme was generally in line with the teacher's scheme and one of the items it catered for was for those who wished to pursue further educational opportunities.  An example of this is the online Higher Diploma in Arts in Primary Education course with Hibernia College.  This intensive course requires students to engage in periods of classroom observation and teaching practice amounting to a total of 18 weeks over two school years.  As a result, an SNA is required to be away from duty on many occasions (between unpaid and paid leave types), possibly impacting on the care, educational and welfare needs of special needs pupils, which as you will understand, must take precedence over all other considerations.</p><p>  The above-mentioned circular, therefore, requires SNAs who are undertaking this course to take a career break for the school years in which they are required to spend periods away from their SNA post on school observation/teaching practice for the purposes of completing the course.   It should also be noted that in addition to the Circular which issued in June 2012, a letter issued to the Deputy Programme Director of the Higher Diploma in Arts at Hibernia College on 19 July 2012 enclosing a copy of the circular and explaining its impact for SNAs.</p></reply>

PRD remains a critical financial emergency measure, supporting the fiscal position to the extent of some &euro;1 billion annually. </p><p>  I would however note that, as lately legislated in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year will fall from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This rate cut will be worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.</p><p>  This progressive aspect of the January 2014 PRD adjustment with respect to take-home pay is mirrored by the progressive design of the PRD itself. As an income-graduated measure applying to pensionable public servants, PRD is structured in such a way that increasing rates of deduction are applied to increasing bands or slices of an affected person's pay each year. In this matrix of band and rates a zero per cent rate applies to the first &euro;15,000 of earnings, which is especially important for lower-paid public service workers, in that it markedly dampens the proportion of pay deducted. In terms of its detailed composition, PRD is currently applied by reference to the following set of income bands and associated reduction rates:</p><p>  First &euro; 15,000 of earnings: exempt</p><p>  Earnings between &euro; 15,000 and &euro; 20,000: 5%</p><p>  Earnings between &euro; 20,000 and &euro; 60,000: 10%</p><p>  Earnings above &euro; 60,000: 10.5%</p><p>  Based on this set of deduction rates, the PRD imposition on a public servant paid &euro;20,000 in a year is &euro;250, or 1.25% of pay, not 10% of pay as stated in the Deputy's second question. Likewise, the PRD taken from a public servant paid &euro;60,000 in a year is &euro;4,250, or 7.08% of pay, not 10.5% as stated by the Deputy.  </p><p>  In terms of the actual outturns in the example cases raised by the Deputy, the large difference in PRD impact between 1.25% of pay at &euro;20,000 and 7.08 % of pay at &euro;60,000 shows how, across this pay gap, PRD acts in a manifestly progressive way. While this large difference would lessen in a post-tax relief analysis, the lower paid person would undoubtedly retain a clear edge.</p><p>  For the record, PRD, though tax-relieved, does not qualify for relief from PRSI or USC. All such reliefs are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

The national revaluation programme is a priority for Government and is a feature of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. The programme is particularly important given the significant changes that have occurred in rental values following the economic downturn of recent years. The purpose of a revaluation is to distribute commercial rates liabilities more equitably among ratepayers based on up-to-date values. Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability. Even though property values have fallen generally, given that the purpose is to redistribute the overall rates liability, some ratepayers will obtain a reduction while others will experience an increase from the process of redistribution but, overall, revaluation results in a fairer distribution of the rates burden.</p><p>  In line with Government priorities, I am very keen that the revaluation programme would be expedited so that the first revaluation in 25 years can be completed as soon as possible across the country. In keeping with Government policy, I have introduced the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012, which is currently before the Oireachtas. The primary purpose of this legislation is to accelerate the revaluation process. The Bill also includes new features which provide for the streamlining of the valuation appeals procedures available to ratepayers and as part of the efforts to accelerate the national revaluation programme, it also provides the legislative basis for carrying out a revaluation based on self-assessment by ratepayers and also for the external delivery of elements of the valuation process. </p><p>  Under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation of that property determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate on valuation (ARV) set annually by the elected members of the rating authority. Revaluation is the mechanism whereby movements in property valuations as a result of economic factors are reflected in valuation lists. Following the first revaluation in each area, the Valuation Act 2001 provides for subsequent, recurring revaluations to be carried out at intervals of a minimum of 5 years and no later than 10 years. This will ensure that movements in the property market are tracked and reflected in rateable valuations within a reasonable timeline, which has not been the case heretofore. Accordingly, individual valuations would be established and remain fixed for a 5-10 year period. On the other hand the ARV can, as determined by the elected members of the rating authority, vary from year to year and therefore so can the amount of rates payable annually.</p><p>  Valuations reflect the value of all individual properties in particular rating authority areas at the statutory valuation date (28th October 2011 for Waterford). Movements in valuations since the last date by which valuations were set (1988/89) reflect the relative changes to rental values within and between sectors such as retail, industrial and hospitality between 1988 and 2011. Accordingly, some businesses will have an increase in their rates liability while others will experience a decrease following revaluation. </p><p>  The setting of valuation levels during a revaluation exercise such as that underway in Waterford City Council, Waterford County Council and Dungarvan Town Council is based on market evidence available to the Valuation Office, including information solicited from and provided by ratepayers. In establishing the levels for rateable properties, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in carrying out his function. In relation to particular cases there is, of course, a well established statutory process whereby a ratepayer, if he or she considers that the proposed valuation or any of the details contained in the Proposed Valuation Certificate are incorrect, can make representations to the Valuation Manager.  There is also a subsequent statutory right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, an independent body set up for such purposes and subsequently, on a point of law, there is an appeal to the High and Supreme Courts. </p><p>  In keeping with the principle of separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates, the amount of rates that a rating authority can raise is generally a matter for decision by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and does not come within the competence of the Commissioner of Valuation whose sole responsibility lies in administering the system of rateable valuation as underpinned by the Valuation Act, 2001. However, in so far as valuation legislation is concerned, there is a specific provision in the 2001 Act which allows the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make an order requiring a rating authority to exercise its powers to make rates in such a manner that it does not exceed the amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the first year following a revaluation except for any increase determined by the consumer price index.</p></reply>

In effect, the Order allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices being charged to consumers, thereby seriously constraining competition in the grocery trade. </p><p>  Since the repeal of that Order in 2006, no statutory basis exists for me, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to make a minimum pricing order.</p><p>  The use of aggressive pricing strategies in any business is a legitimate marketing tool and is the normal outcome of the competitive process. Low cost and below cost selling by a retailer is not of itself an offence unless it involves abuse of a dominant position.

At the end of 2012 there were 6 IDA Ireland supported companies in Monaghan employing 350 people.  In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with these client companies in order to transform the existing FDI base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities.</p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  In order to achieve balanced regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways. </p><p>  County Monaghan is part of IDA&rsquo;s North East Region along with Counties Cavan and Louth.  Through its network of overseas offices, IDA Ireland markets the North East Region for new inward investment through the Gateway of Dundalk. In addition the Agency works closely with all of its 34 client companies in the Region which currently employ 3,200 people, to encourage them to further develop their engagement in the region.  </p><p>  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one county in the Region has a positive impact on other counties in the Region. </p><p>  I consider that it is neither practicable nor effective to establish jobs task forces or specific jobs plans around the country as a general mechanism to address high unemployment.  I believe that to embark on such a course would involve diverting the various State Agencies from their on-going efforts to create jobs.  A considerable administrative commitment is involved in servicing any additional committees and groups which may be set up and, given the constrained staff resources facing all public sector bodies at present, I am strongly of the opinion that establishing such additional groups, except in very exceptional circumstances, would not be in the best interests of using the State&rsquo;s resources effectively.</p></reply>

The government will now review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances. A plan for the implementation of the Recommendation will be developed before the end of 2013.</p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed in the first quarter of 2013, at 53,800, decreased by over 10,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</p><p>  The additional costs involved in delivering the Youth Guarantee in Ireland are likely to be substantial.  Issues will therefore arise as to how a guarantee is to be financed and over what period, given the fiscal constraints currently facing the country.  In this context the additional funding available from the EU, to be allocated across qualifying member states is actually &euro;3bn.  The balance of &euro;3bn is a reallocation of monies from within the European Social Fund. Although it is now proposed to frontload the provision of these funds the actual process by which they will be allocated to member states is is as yet unclear. </p><p>  As part of the process of developing our own national implementation plan  the costs of any measures involved arising in 2014 will be dealt with in the normal way through the 2014 Budget.</p></reply>

However, I understand that it is on the Record of Protected Structures for County Cork.  Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012 provides for the protection of architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including them on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>  Under the Planning &amp;amp; Development Acts 2000-2010, the local authority is the decision-making body in the first instance in relation to planning applications.  An Bord Pleanala is the appeals authority for planning applications.  My role in relation to planning applications is limited to that of statutory consultee in cases where a proposed development may have an effect on natural, archaeological or architectural heritage.  I understand that Cork County Council have received an application for planning permission in relation to the this building and, as the building is on the Record of Protected Structures, officials in my Department have asked the Council to refer this application to me for consultation under the Planning and Development Act.</p><p>  I refer the Deputy to Cork County Council as the appropriate body to consult with reference to this planning application.</p></reply>

In one case, the court ruled that there was a dispute as to the facts and made a declaration that section 62(3) of the 1966 Act is incompatible with the State&rsquo;s obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In the other case the court ruled that there was no dispute as to the facts and did not make a declaration of incompatibility.

The level of capital funding available has declined significantly in recent years along the lines highlighted in the Medium Term Exchequer Framework for Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016.  As a result capital spending on housing programmes is subject to constraint over the short-term.</p><p>  On 22 February 2013 I announced capital allocations to local authorities under the suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability amounting to &euro;42.750 million. In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible.  In framing the 2013 allocations, my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence.  Between them local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totalling &euro;18 million.  his year I allocated local authorities the full amount of their contractual commitments.  The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013.  Meath County Council was allocated &euro; 487,123.</p><p>  I n order to deal with any acute or particular strain which might arise in the operation of the schemes over the course of the year I have set aside a small capital reserve.  To date, I have approved additional allocations totalling &euro;1.2 million for 13 local authorities.  My Department is closely monitoring expenditure across all the measures under the housing programme.  I will consider requests from local authorities for further funds to be allocated to the grants measure in the event of any saving arising elsewhere.</p></reply>

This year&rsquo;s programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed specifically at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building.  On 1 March 2013, I announced capital allocations of &euro;10m to local authorities in respect of energy efficiency retrofitting works for this year.  Earlier this month, I announced a new &euro;50 million three-year energy efficiency investment programme for local authority homes.  This is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s additional &euro;150 million capital investment in the economy over 2013-2014 aimed at stimulating growth.</p><p>  This programme will target the 25,000 least energy efficient local authority homes.  This will result in warmer homes and lower energy bills for thousands of families and will also create around 1,000 jobs in the sector.  I intend to announce capital allocations to local authorities very shortly in order that contracts can be commenced as soon as possible.  This programme will operate nationwide and homes in all local authority areas will benefit under this measure.  My Department met recently with housing practitioners from all local authorities with the objective of getting work started as quickly as possible. Some &euro;10 million of the &euro;50 million programme is available for spending in 2013.</p></reply>

The ISI published the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (Authorisation and Supervision of Personal Insolvency Practitioners) Regulations 2013 (S.I.

Once applications for authorisation are made, the ISI anticipates that it will be in a position to issue authorisations within 10 working days. As soon as an individual or corporate body is authorised, their details will be available on the ISI website, www.isi.gov.ie.</p><p>  It is expected that insolvent debtors can contact Approved Intermediaries and Personal Insolvency Practitioners and begin to receive initial advice from them in the second half of July.  The ISI expects to begin receiving applications for Debt Relief Notices or Protective Certificates in the case of a Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement shortly thereafter. It is likely that the number of authorised Approved Intermediaries and Personal Insolvency Practitioners will increase steadily throughout the summer and autumn.</p></reply>

In that context, it is important that the LRC proposals, or what is now known as the Haddington Road Agreement, on saving &euro;1 billion from the public service pay bill, including &euro;300 million this year are fully implemented.</p><p>  Importantly, those proposals contain provisions for a review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which would start in September and would include an examination of the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The outcome of such a review would be an important determining factor in any final decision on Garda staffing levels.  However, and whatever the approved staffing complement might be at any time, I do believe that it is important for an organisation such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have some regular intakes of new recruits, even if on a modest scale.  In this context, I am currently engaged in discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding this issue and I expect to bring a Memorandum to Government on the matter shortly.</p></reply>

These revised programmes will be distributed to every Unit in late 2013 and will also be available through other Defence Forces information mediums for planning and preparation purposes. </p><p>  The military authorities advise that for 2014 RDF personnel will be permitted to achieve a reduced grade in a fitness test. The reduced grade for 2014 testing will be based on the results of the fitness evaluation/ survey conducted throughout 2013. RDF personnel will have one (1) year to train for the Defence Forces fitness tests. It is planned that in 2015 all RDF personnel will complete the Annual Fitness test as per Defence Forces Regulations. In previous years only RDF Personnel proceeding on specified military courses had to complete the fitness test. Fitness tests will take place during RDF planned training.</p><p>  The individual Reservist is responsible for achieving the physical fitness standards appropriate to his/her rank on his/her own time. While time or facilities will not be made available to the Reservist for this purpose during training periods, Defence Forces leisure and sports facilities will be available to RDF Personnel during programmed recreational periods while on annual camp (at the discretion of the Reservist&rsquo;s Command Officer).</p></reply>

In the period since its publication, there have been significant changes in the defence and security environment and the defence policy framework has continued to evolve. In this context, the Government decided that there is a requirement to prepare a new White Paper on Defence. This will provide the policy framework for Defence, in all its aspects, for the next decade.</p><p>  Following Government approval, I initiated the preparation of a Green Paper on Defence. The Green Paper is intended to inform and stimulate a mature and informed debate about Ireland&rsquo;s defence policy. When published, it will initiate a broad public consultative process which will provide for members of the public and interest groups to input their views as part of the process of developing the new White Paper on Defence.</p><p>  An interdepartmental group comprising representatives from the Departments of Defence, Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality as well as the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have undertaken a defence and security assessment. This is incorporated within the Green Paper. I have had broad discussions on the Green Paper with officials from my Department and the Defence Forces. In addition, the draft Green Paper was circulated to all Government Departments for their observations. All of these inputs have contributed to the final document.</p><p>  The Green Paper will set out an overview of the current defence policy framework, the changes that have occurred since the publication of the White Paper on Defence (2000) and an assessment of the challenges in the defence and security environment. These issues inform a number of policy focused questions which will be set out in the Green Paper and are intended to guide submissions. </p><p>  I hope to publish the Green Paper and initiate the White Paper public consultative process in the coming weeks. It is anticipated that the new White Paper on Defence will be approved by Government and published before June 2014.</p></reply>

It is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide and, on average, provides food assistance to more than 90 million people in 70 countries every year. Ireland has consistently been one of the WFP's most generous donors and key partners, being the twenty-fourth highest contributor of 133 donors from 2009 to date. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the WFP are made up of an annual core contribution from my Department which amounted to just under &euro;10 million in 2012, and support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the Irish Aid programme, for the WFP's response to specific humanitarian emergencies.  In 2012, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided humanitarian funding in support of the WFP's activities in Chad, Syria and the Sahel region in West Africa. In addition, funding was provided to support the operation of the UN's Humanitarian Air Service, which is managed by the WFP. To date in 2013, &euro;3.25 million in humanitarian funding for the WFP has already been approved by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. My Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;9.96m will be paid in Q3 of this year. </p><p>  Ireland was most recently a member of the Executive Board of the WFP for a one-year period in 2011. The Board provides an opportunity for UN Member States such as Ireland to oversee WFP's humanitarian and development food aid activities, with three meetings each year at WFP&rsquo;s headquarters in Rome. When not a Board member, my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade attend in an observer capacity and contribute to the Board's work with our EU partners. Most recently during our Presidency of the EU, we guided this EU position by coordinating the views of the other Member States and the European Commission for presentation at the Board meeting.</p><p>  As a sign of our commitment to the WFP, I was pleased in April of this year to co-sign with Minister Joe Costello T.D. a Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between Ireland and the WFP.  This SPA is a bilateral agreement between us as the donor country and the WFP setting out:</p><p>- Shared objectives in the area of humanitarian emergencies;</p><p>- Multi-annual financial contributions. In this regard my Department has committed to contributing minimum &euro;7m in core funding each year from 2013 to 2015. In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has committed to continue to make available funding on a case by case basis in response to humanitarian crises;</p><p>- Management, reporting and evaluation of the contributions.</p><p>  In addition and unrelated to our contributions, the WFP has identified Ireland and Irish companies as potential suppliers for the products which it procures on an annual basis. My Department and Enterprise Ireland are working to pursue these opportunities.</p></reply>

I am very pleased to say that on the basis of compromise texts put forward and negotiated by the Irish Presidency team, I succeeded in achieving an adjusted negotiating mandate from my Ministerial colleagues across all the Member States that allowed me to take forward these negotiations to the final phase.  The deputy will be aware that, on the basis of this mandate, we achieved political agreement in the CAP Reform negotiations with the European Parliament and the Commission in Brussels yesterday. </p><p>  The deal represents a package of measures that will set the framework for the development of the EU agri-food sector up to 2020.  In terms of the detail of the agreement, I believe this is a well balanced package and is a very good outcome for Irish farmers.  In relation to our key area of concern, the distribution of direct payments, Member States will have the option to apply the partial convergence model put forward by Ireland.  As part of this model, farmers will receive a minimum payment of 60% of the national or regional average payment per hectare by 2019.  Member States will also have the option to set a maximum payment level and to limit the redistribution effect on individual farmers to 30% of their overall payment.  This agreement will limit the level of distribution that would have occurred under the Commission&rsquo;s original proposals to about one third.  In addition, the greening payment will be paid as a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s individual payment.  </p><p>  Now that we know the full outcome of the negotiations, the next step in the process is to determine the best options in terms of implementation from an Irish perspective. I intend to engage in extensive consultation with all stakeholders before I make any decisions as to the shape of future Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 measures.</p></reply>

This funding will support youth work programmes and services serving some 400,000 young people, delivered by over 1,400 youth work personnel, who in turn support a large volunteer base of some 40,000</p><p>  The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department funds the project referred to by the Deputy  under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and the allocation provided by my Department in 2013 is &euro;89,625.</p><p>  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure which amount to &euro;5.393m in 2013, and will amount to &euro;2.976m in 2014,  my Department has tried to ensure that in the determination process for the allocations the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding. </p><p>  There is no doubt that the current budgetary situation is challenging for many organisations. In considering how best to manage within the allocations available organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and other overheads and to work closely with their local VEC that administers the funding on behalf of my Department, in order to maintain the front line services for young people particularly for those young people who may be disadvantaged.</p><p>  With respect to future funding provision, a Comprehensive Value for Money Review of youth funding has been commenced and this report is expected later this year.  </p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

Consistent with civil service strategic management objectives, the approach of the circular is to maximise the discretion available to Departments in addressing post-entry education matters in ways that are most relevant to their own areas of responsibility and this includes provision for paid and unpaid study leave. During 2012, three people availed of paid study leave totalling 7.5 days.

This would also include attendance at conferences, information sessions etc. The nature of this training does not lend itself to easy recording of time spent on it and as it is not considered as 'leave' my Department does not centrally record all of it.

During my visit I met with my counter part, Minister Dmitry Livanov, Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. This meeting was productive and allowed for an exchange of views on the possibility of Ireland entering into a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption with Russia. The Russian authorities acknowledged the satisfactory outcomes for Russian children adopted in Ireland and expressed a willingness to conclude an agreement with Ireland which will be subject to the approval of the Russian parliament. I stated that many Irish families were hopeful of completing future adoptions of Russian children. </p><p>  During these meetings I reiterated to the Russian authorities that the Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and that once adopted in Ireland the child is treated in the same way as other Irish children. This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited. I highlighted the implications of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports.</p><p>  However, in saying this, I emphasised the high standards of child protection that exist in Ireland for all children and the legislative basis under which these standards are enforced. I  emphasised the commitment of the State to intervene in instances where the safety or welfare of any child, adopted or otherwise, is in anyway compromised. I outlined the total commitment of the Irish Government to the child protection and welfare. </p><p>  My Department has undertaken an examination of the draft bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption proposed by the Russian Federation. In order to progress the development of a bilateral agreement the Department has focused on this issue of post placement reporting in relation to Russian children adopted in Ireland, which the Russian authorities have indicated is a necessary component of any bilateral agreement. To this end a draft wording of the sections of the bilateral agreement that relate to post placement reporting is being developed. My officials are in active discussions with officials in the Office of the Attorney General and in the Department of Foreign Affairs on advancing a draft agreement for consideration by the Russian authorities.</p><p>  I have invited the Russian authorities to visit Ireland in September in order to finalise consideration of this aspect of the draft bilateral agreement. </p></reply>

In addition, the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate. The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland. The aim of neuro-rehabilitation is to enable the person to achieve the highest possible level of independence. Desired outcomes range from a return to full independence in social and work situations to a person requiring long-term support and care but with a higher level of independence than in the absence of neuro-rehabilitation. Current services available include acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multi-disciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitative training services. These services are provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and several non-statutory organisations.</p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has been working in collaboration with the HSE's National Disability Unit as part of an expert Working Group planning for the implementation of the Report. The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy&rsquo;s recommendation of &ldquo;hub and spoke&rdquo; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community. This co-operation will continue in 2013.</p><p>  Improving access to outpatient services, including neurology, is a key priority for the Government. Collaborating with individual hospitals, the SDU together with the NTPF and the HSE have developed the OP waiting list minimum dataset that allows for data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie. For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE Service Plan. The SDU/NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.</p></reply>

The National Clinical Programme for Asthma is included in the HSE's 2013 Operational Plan.  Implementation of the Programme is ongoing and will continue in 2014.  To date, different work streams of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma have resulted in the following initiative, the preparation of a Model of Care.  This is currently being finalised and will be sent for stakeholder consultation after 30 June 2013.  The Model of Care cannot be completed until stakeholder responses have been received and considered.  The Model of Care includes a proposal to provide a standardised structured asthma review of each patient by the patient's GP at least annually.  This will optimise treatment, ensure institution of inhaled corticosteroid therapy early in asthma management where appropriate, encourage medication adherence and address underlying problems with asthma care and management.  This will include:</p><p>- Inhaler technique;</p><p>- Adherence to and understanding of medications;</p><p>- Self-management education including personal asthma plans and self-monitoring;</p><p>- Management of co-morbidities and triggers including allergic rhinitis; and</p><p>- Smoking cessation and/or avoidance or exposure to second hand smoke.</p><p>- The establishment of Asthma Check (Chronic Disease Watch Asthma - structured review) - this has been submitted to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) for review.  It is proposed that patients with asthma would be enrolled in Asthma Check on a phased basis with clearly identified target groups.</p><p>- The preparation of Acute Emergency Asthma Guidelines for Adults - this has been submitted to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) for review and feedback.</p><p>- The preparation of Acute Emergency Asthma Guidelines for Paediatrics - these have been completed.</p><p>- Asthma Control in General Practice - these guidelines have been signed off by ICGP and are being implemented.</p><p>- Asthma Educational Programme - this is available online at www. hseland.ie.</p><p>- Practical workshops have been delivered locally by Clinical Nurse Specialists to nurses in Primary and Secondary Care.</p><p>- Nurses and other health professionals have been enrolled in an asthma education module.  This education module is based on the National Asthma guidelines.  This supports healthcare staff in the delivery of evidenced based care and education for patients.  In partnership with the Asthma Society, patient information documents have been developed to support this initiative.</p><p>  The HSE has commenced the appointment of 17 Clinical Nurse Specialists (one per HSE Integrated Service Area) to support the phased roll out of the Integrated Care Diabetes Programme.  When the National Clinical Programme for Asthma's Model of Care has been published an assessment can be made in relation to how it will be implemented in the acute hospital and primary care system and what resources, including nursing resources, will be required.</p></reply>

Neuro-rehabilitation services are presently delivered across a range of settings, from acute  hospitals and specialised neurorehabilitation centres, to primary and community settings, including home.  Service user neuro-rehabilitation needs range from intensive, acute treatment at tertiary level through to long-term neuro-rehabilitation at community level.  Improving access to outpatient services, including neurology, is a key priority for the Government.  Collaborating with individual hospitals, the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), have developed the outpatient waiting list minimum dataset that allows for data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time, consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE Service Plan for 2013.  The SDU/NTPF will work closely with hospitals towards achievement of the maximum waiting time.  The Department of Health and the HSE have developed and published the &ldquo;National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2015&rdquo;.  In addition, the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate.  The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland, including key elements such as guiding principles; implementation structure; methodology for implementation; and information and communication.</p><p>  The Report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.  The recruitment of additional consultants in rehabilitation medicine can only be considered in this context i.e. reconfiguring current services and available resources.  The key priority areas, as identified in the HSE&rsquo;s National Operational Plan for 2013 are to Map and develop Integrated Service Area level rehabilitation networks; Implement the model of care for rehabilitation services within the networks with a focus on community rehabilitation.  Current provision for people requiring neuro-rehabilitation services, including those with multiple sclerosis, range from acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multi-disciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitation training services.  These services are provided directly by the HSE and several non-statutory organisations, including MS Ireland.  The HSE provided over &euro;2.6m to MS Ireland in 2012 towards the provision of services and supports.  Neuro-rehabilitation services can be accessed through HSE local health offices.</p></reply>

Firstly, I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of the child involved. The loss of a loved one is hard for family and friends at any time, but the sudden and unexpected death of a young child is particularly difficult. In relation to this incident, the facts are that, at 1.16 a.m. on 18 June 2013, an emergency call was received for a baby who was reported as not breathing. The National Ambulance Service (NAS) was initially unable to obtain sufficient details of where help was needed, which led to a delay in reaching the incident. The first emergency resource arrived at the scene 30 minutes after the initial 999 call. The patient was subsequently pronounced dead. The incident has been the subject of a systems analysis, as is routine in cases where a death occurs, to ascertain whether call-taking protocols were followed. Following an examination of the facts, the HSE is satisfied that systems and processes operated correctly and there are no plans to carry out any further review. However, interrogation has been strengthened to try and mitigate the impact of a call where the incident location cannot be identified. In addition, HSE Communications has been requested to run a publicity campaign to improve public awareness of the need to communicate precisely the locations of incidents. In the interest of respecting the dignity and grief of the family, I wish to make no further comment on the specific incident.</p><p>  A significant reform programme has been underway to totally reconfigure the way the HSE manages and delivers pre-hospital care services, to ensure a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology. The National Control Centre Reconfiguration Project, which is endorsed by HIQA and which represents international best practice, will reduce the number of ambulance control centres to a single national control system, with significant investment in new voice, data and mapping technologies. The project is also a key element of Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015. Both HIQA and the NAS have had concerns over control and dispatch structures at some control centres leading up to the development of the national control system. Accordingly, the NAS moved the Cork and Tralee centres to its Townsend Street centre on an interim basis in May, to mitigate such concerns pending completion of the national centre. Detailed preparations took place to ensure the safety of services during the move of the Cork and Kerry operations. The NAS provided additional staff, training, technology and equipment to assist this process. 112/999 calls from those areas are now answered in Dublin using improved technology. The NAS is satisfied that Townsend St, while not appropriate to the needs of the overall reconfiguration project, is nevertheless suitable and infrastructurally sound for the interim accommodation of these centres.</p></reply>

However, in an emergency admission if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his/her hospital consultant.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per day to the hospital even though they have seen and paid their consultant privately.</p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise from those private patients is estimated to be about &euro;200m per year. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year or operating a medium size public hospital. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.</p><p>  The Health (Amendment) Bill 2013 is presently before the D&aacute;il and provides for charges to be levied on all in-patients who are treated privately by their consultant, irrespective of where the patient is accommodated in the hospital and regardless of whether they are admitted directly or through emergency departments.</p></reply>

This Programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision around the country.  To assist in addressing some of these variations, I announced the allocation of &euro;1m in funding for autism and early intervention services in 2012.  </p><p>  Beechpark is a regional, community-based HSE service which provides specialised clinical supports for children with a specific diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder up to 18 years of age, who attend designated special schools, outreach preschools and outreach classes in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  I approved &euro;300,000 of this funding, which equates to five therapists posts, for Beechpark services in Dublin, north of the Liffey, based on the options contained in a report prepared by the HSE.  This was to address the pressing needs of its catchment area, with a particular emphasis on reducing waiting times.  The report also proposed an allocation for Beechpark in the Dublin Mid-Leinster region which was to be rolled out in year two.    </p><p>  Following ongoing discussions on the best way forward in relation to Beechpark Autism Services, the HSE has confirmed that the funding approved will be allocated to HSE Dublin North East in 2013 for Beechpark in order to address the waiting list for services in Dublin North East.  This will provide, in the first instance, for the recruitment of the necessary five therapy staff.  The catchment areas that will benefit are the Local Health Office areas of Dublin North, Dublin North Central and Dublin North West.  </p><p>  I also established an Independent Review Group in 2012, to look at the Beechpark model of services and how resources could be used in the best and most effective way, in light of the HSE Review of Autism Services and the re-organisation of services underway in line with the 0-18s Programme.  Further funding in relation to Beechpark and other regions of the country, was put on hold, pending the outcome of this Review.  I understand that this Review is expected to be concluded shortly.</p><p>  The HSE has confirmed that the &euro;300,000 is just a first step in 2013.  The balance of funding for autism and early intervention services nationally will be made available.  The issue of the allocation of these further resources will be required to be looked at, in light of the findings of the Independent Review.  </p></reply>

It will deliver a number of important benefits, including:</p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs;</p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State;</p><p>- timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions; and</p><p>- reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available. The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 November and further price reductions were implemented on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years.  Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  Under this Agreement, since 1 November 2012, the HSE only reimburses generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine.  In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE requires a generic medicine to be priced below the originator price.  This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.</p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p></reply>

In 2012, the HSE's Medicines Management Programme  was established and one of its key tasks is to communicate with prescribers regarding best practice. </p><p>  The Programme has identified 'preferred drugs' for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients.  This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol. The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer. </p><p>  A further initiative underway to assist with GP prescribing is the launch of the HSE's Prescribing Guidance System (PGS).  This system supports prescribers with integrated 'point of prescribing' information making it easier for GPs to make decisions in line with MMP prescribing guidance.  In turn, the system also gives assurance regarding the effectiveness of prescribing guidance interventions.</p><p>  It is anticipated that this prescribing guidance system will be a critical assistance to the GP community and significantly important to the wider health system.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-27a.754.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062700076#WRX02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 288 together.</p><p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 was commenced on Monday, 24 June 2013.  This Act provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  It also sets out statutory procedures governing the supply, reimbursement and pricing of medicines and other items to patients under the GMS and community drug schemes. </p><p>  The commencement of this Act provides the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) and the HSE with a robust statutory framework for the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing on a phased basis, with priority given to those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.</p><p>  Previously, when a specific brand of medicine was prescribed for a patient, a pharmacist could only supply that particular brand, even when less expensive generic versions of the same medicine were available.  The Act now permits pharmacists to substitute medicines prescribed, provided that they have been designated as safely interchangeable by the IMB.</p><p>  The IMB will review an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  It is expected that the first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, will be published in mid-August.  The IMB will publish subsequent lists for other groups of medicines on an ongoing basis.  From the end of the year onwards, hundreds of thousands of prescriptions will be subject to generic substitution, which will offer choice and reduced prices to patients.</p><p>  The legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for each group of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products. Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.  The first reference price is expected to be implemented by November. </p><p>  Under the latest agreement negotiated with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland which came into effect on 1st November 2012, the price of generic medicines published on the List of Interchangeable Medicines by the IMB will be immediately reduced<font color="#FF0000"> </font>from not more than 50% to not more than 40% of the pre-patent expiry prices of the equivalent branded original medicines, i.e. a reduction of 20% on the current price of generic products.  This price reduction will take effect in advance of the setting of a reference price.</p><p>  Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products priced at or below the reference price.  If a patient would like to receive a particular brand that costs more than the reference price then the patient will have to pay the additional cost of that product.  In cases where substitution is prohibited for clinical reasons, patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.   </p><p>  The Act also provides that the HSE may use a competitive process to determine the relevant price of medicines reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.  While there are no plans at present to introduce competitive tendering, in the case of high volume, off-patent medicines, it is expected that the HSE will set reference prices where appropriate.  Reference prices will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the legislation, in particular, securing value for money for the taxpayer.</p><p>  This legislation will promote price competition, a greater use of generics and deliver lower medicine prices for the taxpayer and for patients.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics. </p></reply>

Irish hospitals use the AR-DRG grouping system which groups each hospital&rsquo;s inpatient and daycase workload into 698 DRGs.  Until this point, the main use of the DRG system has been to adjust the budget allocations of acute public hospitals by up to 3% in line with the complexity of their casemix and their relative performance under the Casemix System.  DRGs have also been used as a tool to assist with planning as well as monitoring and assessing performance within the acute hospital sector.</p><p>  The draft Money Follows the Patient Policy Paper, which I published for consultation on 15 February last, proposes the introduction of a new model of funding for public hospital care.   This involves changing from the current inefficient system of block grant budgets to a new approach where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity they undertake.  Introduction of MFTP effectively means that hospitals will be funded on the basis of the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients and not the size of last year&rsquo;s budget.  The new approach will be facilitated through the introduction of a prospective case-based payment system using the existing DRG grouping system.  </p><p>  Encouraging hospitals to use the resources at their disposal more efficiently is one of the central objectives of the MFTP system.  A recent pilot project, which implemented a MFTP model in the orthopaedic speciality, showed the positive impact that MFTP can have through productivity gains.  Introduction of MFTP resulted in a two day reduction in average length of stay for relevant DRGs and a 45% increase in day of surgery admission rates, while not raising any quality concerns.</p><p>  It is proposed that MFTP will be rolled-out in shadow form in 2013 ahead of full phased implementation from 2014.</p></reply>

The agreement encompasses a range of flexibilities to enhance productivity and efficiency and to maximise the availability of consultants, as key clinical decision-makers. These arrangements are to be given effect as determined by service needs and resource considerations.  Management across the hospital service have been instructed by the HSE to implement the agreement with effect from November 2012.  I have asked the HSE to communicate with the Deputy with more detailed information.</p><p>  Two items were referred to the Labour Court for a binding ruling &ndash; current rest day entitlements and the fee payable for second opinions under the Mental Health Acts. A third issue, historic rest days, was referred under the normal IR processes.  </p><p>  The Court recommended a 25% reduction in each consultant&rsquo;s entitlement to historic rest leave and that this must be used by 2020.  Management are giving effect to this recommendation though the Unions do not agree with it.</p><p>  In relation to rest day entitlements the Labour Court recommended that compensatory rest be given in respect of actual call-out time only rather than leave (in the form of rest days) whether there is a call-out or not.  Implementation of this recommendation is under discussion between management and the medical representative organisations in order to ensure workable arrangements that will not adversely affect care.</p><p>  The Court recommended that the fee payable to Consultant Psychiatrists for the provision of a Second Opinion under the Mental Health Act, 2001 be addressed as part of the review of allowances in the public service.  This matter will be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 2.27 of the Haddington Road Agreement.</p></reply>

The financial challenges to be addressed this year are significant and a total cost reduction requirement of &euro;721m was identified in the National Service Plan approved in January.</p><p>  Based on a review of financial data to date, the HSE is not flagging any new concerns or risks beyond those which were set out within the National Service Plan 2013 (NSP). These risks remain and principally include: </p><p>  - Savings of &euro;353m within the Primary Care Reimbursement Service;</p><p>  - Pay and pay related savings under the Croke Park Agreement and the Haddington Road Agreement;</p><p>  - Private Health Insurance Income;</p><p>  - The general scale of the overall challenge within the remainder of the community and in particular hospital services. </p><p>  The rebalancing of hospital budgets in 2013 has ensured that hospitals have been given budgets which are related more closely to their costs in 2012 - however as indicated in the Service Plan it has not been possible to provide for the full amount of 2012 costs. The HSE will be required to address any slippage in Cost Containment Plans and to ensure that additional measures are identified and safely implemented to bridge any projected deficits which are within HSE direct control, while engaging with my Department on a continuing basis.</p></reply>

This includes 4 companies providing year round scheduled passenger services between Ireland and the UK and France.    Activity in the sector has recently proved positive. Irish shipping and port activity in terms of trade rose by 2% in the first quarter of 2013 when compared to the corresponding period of 2012 according to the latest figures produced by the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO). While this is positive it is to an extent the result of the poor weather conditions and the resulting requirement of the agricultural sector to import feedstuffs.</p><p>  My Department through its agency the IMDO works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services. Failte Ireland is also involved in active promotion and marketing of sea access routes to Ireland in their role of promoting Ireland as a high quality and competitive tourist destination. However, it must be remembered that all shipping companies servicing routes to and from Ireland are commercial companies.  Any new initiatives to enhance services must be market driven, as it is not government policy to fund international shipping services as this would be contrary to EU State Aid and Competition Law.</p></reply>

As an island, air transport connectivity is clearly of vital importance to Ireland for both economic and social reasons. There is a healthy competitive market for air services in and out of the country and we benefit from a wide range of air connections, both short and long haul. New routes are being announced on a regular basis by both Irish and international airlines. Maintaining and developing this connectivity is certainly a key objective of national aviation policy. The airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available to help support new services.  </p><p> A public consultation is currently underway on the formulation of a comprehensive aviation policy framework.   An issues paper was published on 1 March this year inviting submissions from stakeholders and interested parties. The deadline for submissions has recently been extended to 12 July in response to a number of requests. I anticipate that all the major airlines and airports will have substantial contributions to make to the consultation process. They each have a role to play in maximising options and opportunities for the development of the aviation sector.  I look forward to receiving their submissions along with the views of all interested parties. Following receipt of submissions, a draft National Aviation Policy Statement will be issued in the second half of 2013. This will provide further opportunity for stakeholder input before the adoption of the new policy document in early 2014. The new policy will outline the actions to be taken by Government to help sustain and develop the aviation sector, in order to create jobs and support business and tourism.</p></reply>
