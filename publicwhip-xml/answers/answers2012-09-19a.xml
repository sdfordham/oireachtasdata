Work is in progress to develop a strategic action plan targeted at meeting the specific needs of female offenders.  The two agencies involved, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service, are working together to develop a women centred holistic strategy that seeks to address those factors that lead some women to come in contact with the criminal justice system while also seeking to provide better outcomes for those women whom the courts deem that a custodial sanction is warranted.  The strategy aims to ensure a more targeted response which takes into consideration the particular issues that pertain to female offending including: the pathways into crime for women may be different to that for men; the profile of women offenders can be different to male; offenders; the nature and range of offences committed by women can be different to those committed by men; female offending can be multifaceted and complex and factors such as poverty, homelessness, mental and physical health, abuse, domestic violence and substance misuse are often significant causal factors for female offending.</p><p>  The overall aims of the action plan will be to identify and divert those women at risk of a custodial sentence through greater use of community supports and inter-agency co-operation; improve the outcomes for those women in custody; reduce recidivism; strengthen early intervention measures through adopting a co-ordinated, multi-agency approach; and explore the potential of alternatives to custody.  The action plan is expected to be finalised by the end of the year.  Finally, in line with the recommendations in the Report of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group, the establishment of a group to carry out an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy has just been announced.  That group will look at this issue.</p></reply>

Niall Molloy in Clara, County Offaly in July 1985; if he will accede to the request by the family for an independent inquiry into the priest's violent death; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[39114/12]</b></p></ques>

Since the response to the Deputy of 20 June, the Minister was informed that further potential lines of enquiry have been identified on foot of information brought to the attention of the Garda authorities and that these are now being progressed to a conclusion.  As the Minister has indicated previously, upon receipt of a final report from the Commissioner he will review the situation.</p><p>  The Minister understands that the officers carrying out the examination have met with the family members of the deceased on a number of occasions, including very recently, and that the family was updated on the examination of the issues being undertaken.  The Minister fully appreciates the family's continuing concerns regarding these issues, but hopes that the Deputy will agree that, in the first instance, we need to allow the present Garda examination proceed to a conclusion.</p></reply>

Such appointments are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established pursuant to the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995. Under section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Advisory Board submits to the Minister for Justice and Equality the names of the persons whom it recommends for appointment.  The Minister then brings the names to Government.  Section 17 of the same Act provides that these procedures shall not apply where the Government propose to advise the President to appoint a serving judge.</p><p>  A review of the current appointment procedure is ongoing and the matter will be considered further on completion. The review is wide-ranging and includes consideration of the following issues: the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence; eligibility for appointment; composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board; the appointments process; accountability in respect of its functioning; and promoting equality and diversity.</p><p>  Any proposal to revise the current system of judicial appointments would involve amendment of the legislation and would, of course, be a matter for consideration by Government in due course.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-19a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/answers2012091900062#WRA01100"><p>The Reception and Integration Agency of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal. Lisbrook direct provision accommodation centre in Galway is part of RIA's portfolio of direct provision accommodation. RIA made a decision to close the Lisbrook accommodation centre on the expiry of its 18 month contract with its operator. This was done principally for two reasons: to enable RIA to remain on budget this year and subsequent years and a reflection of the fact that the demand for RIA services has fallen sharply. At the end of 2010, RIA was accommodating 6,107 persons. At 9 September, 2012 this figure had reduced to 4,996 persons, a decline of 1,111 persons or 18%. This year alone there has been a drop of 8% in the number of persons in direct provision accommodation.</p><p>  The decline in 2012 is part of a continuing trend and it should be noted that, in the period 2009 to date, RIA has reduced its accommodation portfolio from 60 centres to 36.  In relation to budgetary issues, RIA like all Department of Justice and Equality bodies must operate in a significantly lower financial envelope and cannot countenance an overspend or the continuation of contracts which may no longer be required. In this context it should be noted that the actual budget of RIA declined by &euro;28 million in the period 2008 to 2012.</p><p>  In the light of representations received primarily expressing concern about the dislocation of school-going children, the Minister has directed that the background circumstance of the decision to close the centre be re-considered.  Therefore, arrangements for the transfer of residents from Lisbrook accommodation centre have been suspended, pending further consideration of a number of issues, including the impact on school children of such a closure, as well as the broader financial restrictions within which RIA must operate, as well as the need for it to manage its diminishing budget efficiently in the current critical economic situation.</p><p>  As part of any planned accommodation centre closure, RIA does work to retain as many families as possible in the same catchment area for schools, and for those residents who are linked to critical medical services locally. This practice was underway at Lisbrook as part of any planned closure. The review exercise now being undertaken on the non-renewal of the contract is aimed at striking a balance between budget realities and the reasonable need of individuals, families and children, in particular at the start of the school year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-19a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/answers2012091900062#WRA01300"><p>As of the 31 July 2012 there were 13,547 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along with 911 Reserve Garda&iacute; and over 2,000 civilian staff.  As the Deputy will be aware, public expenditure must be reduced to a sustainable level.  This means, among other things, reducing expenditure on public service pay, whether by reducing headcount or otherwise.  This is particularly so in those public service bodies where pay forms an especially large part of overall expenditure, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where 90% of expenditure is on pay and pensions.</p><p>  The current and projected Garda budgets will therefore necessitate a significant reduction in Garda expenditure. This will undoubtedly require further reductions in Garda numbers. This has been well known for some time, dating right back to when the last Government was in office and the question of the exact level of the reductions required will depend on the potential for alternative savings which could mitigate the scale of the reduction in head count required. In this context, the Department of Justice and Equality is engaging in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter and it would not be appropriate to comment further on this at this point in time.</p><p>  It is important to emphasise that the reduction in Garda strength is being accompanied by real reform which is designed to introduce new efficiencies into the delivery of the policing service. New Garda rosters commenced at the end of April 2012 on a national pilot basis. The new rosters are designed to better match the availability of Garda&iacute; with policing demands at national and local level, while also safeguarding the welfare of members.  Steps have also been taken to rationalise the Garda station network, so that the right balance is struck between the optimum number of Garda stations and the most effective deployment of Garda&iacute; on operational duties.  These and other reforming measures seek to maximise the efficiency of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that, even with reduced strength, an effective policing service will continue to be delivered across the country.</p></reply>

The establishment of this group is in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group which published its Report last year.  The Thornton Group recommended that an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy should be carried out.  The Review will examine all aspects of penal policy including prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, accommodation and regimes, support for reintegration and rehabilitation and the issue of female offenders.  I expect the Group to report by mid 2013 and it would be the intention to publish their report.</p></reply>

Since end 2010, the number of persons availing of direct provision services has reduced from 6,107 person to 4,996 persons at 9 September 2012, a drop of 1,111 persons or 18%. There has been an 8% drop in the number of persons in direct provision in 2012 alone. In line with this decline in demand for direct provision accommodation, RIA has reduced the number of bed spaces in its portfolio. Since the beginning of 2009, RIA has reduced the number of direct provision accommodation centres from 60 to 36.</p><p>In response to the Deputy's question, I am providing a separate table with the information requested.  The Deputy may also wish to know that, on its website: www.ria.gov.ie, RIA publishes monthly statistical information similar to that requested in this PQ.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-19a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/answers2012091900062#WRA01900"><p>Offences relating to illegal money lending are currently provided for in Part VIII of the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act, which provides for a prohibition on engaging in the business of money lending without a licence.  A person who is found guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to  a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p><p>  I am informed that the latest available figures provided by the Courts Service indicate that no prosecutions for such an offence have been recorded over the past seven years.  However, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that where offences under section 98 are disclosed, and are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the matter will be the subject of investigation under the direction of the local District Officer, with relevant expert assistance available from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  The Minister has also been informed by the Garda authorities that their records indicate that no proceedings have been recorded for offences relating to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 for the period 2009 to date.</p><p>  The Minister would therefore encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.

As the Deputy will be aware the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 has facilitated more effective use of the detention period under section 4 in the case of complex investigations into white collar crime. It has done so by making it possible for persons arrested and detained for questioning to be released and their detention suspended so that further enquiries can be conducted during the suspension period.  While these developments have been of some assistance to the investigating authorities, I am open to making further changes to the law if that is deemed necessary.  To that end, I have asked my officials - who are currently undertaking a review of detention powers generally - to specifically consider the position in relation to white collar crime.  I expect that the review will be completed before the end of the year and I can assure the Deputy that any necessary changes identified by the review will be prioritised.</p></reply>

In accordance with this principle, the traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.</p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created important exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  As you may already be aware, I announced only yesterday, an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group which published its report last year.  The review will examine all aspects of penal policy including sentencing policies.  I expect the Group to report by mid 2013 and the intention would be to publish their report. I will give careful consideration to any recommendations of the report when it is received.   In advance of the report&rsquo;s publication, it would be premature to propose any possible legislative changes.</p></reply>

These groups maintain more than just a nodding acquaintance with organised criminals in funding themselves and their activities.  Indeed, these paramilitaries are deeply involved in criminal activities. Countering the threat from terrorists has always been a priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and nothing has changed in that regard.  Despite the positive developments there have been in recent years in the North, the Garda&iacute; have never let up in their efforts to counteract these groups.</p><p>  For obvious reasons I will not comment on details of Garda operational matters nor on security related measures. Nevertheless in relation to the incidents mentioned by the Deputies, it must be accepted that the Garda members present, in taking appropriate operational decisions had, above all else, a particular responsibility to ensure the safety of the public in what was a crowded environment.  The possibility that there may have been an effort to provoke the Garda&iacute; into taking action with a view to generating public disorder and greater publicity for those involved, cannot be discounted.  We should not underestimate the difficulties faced on the ground by Garda&iacute; dealing with this type of situation and it is all too easy for people who do not have to make these decisions to say what should or should not have been done.</p><p>  As the Deputy will now be aware, the Garda Commissioner has set up a dedicated operation, &ldquo;Operation Ambience&rdquo;.  As a result, numerous searches were conducted of various locations in Dublin and surrounding counties and a substantial number of arrests were also made.  Three people have been charged with membership of an unlawful organisation under the Offences Against the State Act and Garda inquiries into the matter are ongoing.</p><p>  I am strongly committed to ensuring that the Garda&iacute; have the necessary resources they need, not just in terms of manpower and equipment, but also in terms of legislative provisions, to bear down on these so-called dissident groups. As recently as last June, I obtained the approval of the Oireachtas to renew certain provisions of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. These provisions include those of directing an unlawful organisation, unlawful collection of information and training in the use of firearms.  I should mention, specifically, that firearms legislation contains very heavy penalties in relation to the illegal use of firearms.</p></reply>

The Garda&iacute; employ multi-disciplinary, intelligence-led approaches to ensure the activities and resources of individuals and groups involved in all criminal enterprises, including armed robbery, are effectively targeted.  A wide range of legislative powers are in place to support the investigation and detection of serious crime, including by means of covert surveillance, and very serious penalties have been introduced for firearms and organised crime offences.</p><p>  Serious criminals are being brought before the Courts on a regular basis and substantial sentences handed down.  At the present time, the Garda authorities have in place a number of intelligence led operations focusing on violent organised crime groups, as a direct result of which a number of individuals are before the courts charged with serious offences, up to and including murder.

The Criminal Justice (Withholding of information on offences against children and vulnerable adults) Act 2012 was commenced on 1 August 2012 making it an offence for a person to fail to notify the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if they know or believe that a serious offence has been committed against a child or vulnerable person.  Separately, my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has announced that she is preparing legislation to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory basis. Under this proposed legislation organisations and named professionals will have statutory responsibility to report information about abuse or significant neglect to the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  It is anticipated that any legal cases arising from the reporting requirements under either piece of legislation would likely impact on the criminal court rather than the family courts. It is not envisaged that the legislation will have any significant impact on the caseload of the family court system. I am conscious, however, that increases in referrals would have implications for other services concerned with child protection.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government, at its meeting on 17 July 2012, approved, in principle, proposals for reforms to our courts structures which will, in due course, require the holding of a Constitutional referendum. The proposed reforms would, if approved by the People in a referendum, facilitate the establishment of a new separate Family Courts structure.</p></reply>

Since end 2010, the number of persons availing of direct provision services has reduced from 6,107 person to 4,996 persons at 9 September 2012, a drop of 1,111 persons or 18%. There has been an 8% drop in the number of persons in direct provision in 2012 alone. In line with this decline in demand for direct provision accommodation, RIA has reduced the number of bed spaces in its portfolio. Since the beginning of 2009, RIA has reduced the number of direct provision accommodation centres from 60 to 36.</p><p><br />  Due to the exceptionally difficult state of the national finances and in response to the need for all government departments to achieve reductions in all areas of Government spending, the Department of Justice and Equality has urged all spending areas to reduce its spending and to monitor all expenditure closely.  RIA is actively engaged in addressing the efficiencies outlined in <i>the Value for Money &amp; Policy Review of the Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme (VFM)</i>   - primarily that of:</p><p>-reducing vacant bed capacity to a maximum of 10%</p><p>-preparing for a major procurement project in order to  <i>&quot;robustly  test&quot;</i>   the rates obtained.</p><p><br />  The Reception &amp; Integration sought and achieved a reduction in its spending by an overall 6% from April to December 2009 (equivalent to 8% over a full year).  These savings continued to be implemented throughout 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 with rate and bed reductions achieved under this exercise instigated wherever possible in furtherance of the VFM and budgetary objectives while at the same time ensuring that high standards of accommodation and services are maintained.  RIA has reduced the number of contracted bed spaces across its portfolio from January 2010 to January 2012 by 30% with further reductions in bed spaces to date in 2012.</p><p><br />  In relation to the State-owned centres RIA has monitored closely the cost of utilities &#8211; in particular, energy costs at State-owned centres.  Since de-regulation of the sector, RIA has actively sought out alternative electricity suppliers. The National Procurement Service (NPS - in OPW) recently completed a new round of contracts in this area and RIA engaged with the selected energy provider to transfer its accounts to that new provider (operating under Energia).  In 2011, RIA&#8217;s expenditure was &#8364;69.5m while in 2012, RIA&#8217;s budget allocation is &#8364;63.5m and it is anticipated that the RIA will operate within this budget allocation.</p></reply>

Membership of organised crime gangs tends to be fluid and offences committed by members of criminal gangs may or may not be connected with an individual's membership of such gangs.  Given this landscape it is not always feasible to be exact at any given time with regard to associations formed and related offences.</p><p>  With regard to the statistical information sought in relation to killings, I have requested the CSO to provide the most up to date figures concerning homicide directly to the Deputy.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the categorisation of killings described in his question does not form part of the classification applied in the Irish Crime Classification System operated by the Central Statistics Office.  Of course, there can be no justification for any homicide and I would like to assure the Deputy that all killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will continue to be so.</p><p>  With regard to other matters raised by the Deputy including witness and jury intimidation, racketeering etc. I can, in general terms,  say that these would be a feature of organised criminality not only in this jurisdiction but in jurisdictions world wide.  However, I would again like to reiterate the continued commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in such criminal activity.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement strategies targeting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations to enable early intervention and prevention of organised crime.</p><p>  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are utilising all available legislation to target organised criminal activity including the provisions contained in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009. I am informed by the Garda authorities that since enactment of the legislation on 23 July 2009, the legislation has been used on 175 occasions where arrests have been made relating to organised crime.  Arising from these arrests two prosecutions have been secured for offences under the legislation, with a further six cases currently before the Courts. In addition, charges have also been preferred for a range of other offences including firearms offences; sale and supply of drugs and drug trafficking; violent disorder; demanding money with menaces and  threats to kill.</p><p>  I am satisfied that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to devote considerable resources to the investigation of organised crime and in bringing the perpetrators before the Courts. The Commissioner and the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have my full support in this regard.</p></reply>

The average cost of a rostered hour is approximately &euro;20 per hour and the average cost of an overtime hour is &euro;31.</p><p>  I am further advised that, as the policing of concerts can require a mixture of public and non-public duty, the proportion of the costs recovered from the organisers will vary from concert to concert.

The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.</p><p>  The scheme, which was introduced on a pilot basis last October, is applicable to suitably assessed prisoners who are serving sentences of more than one and less than eight years.  Those participating are granted renewable temporary release having served at, or after, the 50% stage of their sentence with a condition of their release to undertake supervised community service.  </p><p>  The following factors are taken into account in considering the suitability of a prisoner for temporary release to participate in the scheme: the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates; the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed; the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released; the person's previous criminal record; the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release; the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release; the extent of the prisoner's engagement with therapeutic services while in custody and the likelihood of period of temporary release enhancing his/her reintegration prospects; and conduct while in custody. </p><p>  There have to date been 259 participants on the scheme with 82 offenders currently engaged in community service work. Over 140 offenders have already completed the programme successfully with a small percentage of prisoners returned to custody for non-compliance. The reports to date from the Community Site Supervisors have been very positive and many of the participants have been commended for their work ethic, punctuality and commitment. Initial feedback from the participants has also been positive with many commenting on the supports and structure that it gives them on their release and how it has assisted in their transition back into the community.</p><p>  The Community Return Programme is but one element of the recently published Prison Service strategy which provides for a structured form of release leading to improved resettlement and reintegration opportunities for prisoners along with providing for work to the benefit of communities.</p></reply>

In some cases, special provisions apply.  For example, an offence by a person in authority is effectively treated as an aggravating factor in the case of certain sexual offences against children.  It is the responsibility of the presiding judge to determine the sentence to be imposed in a particular case having heard all the evidence presented, and taking case law, including appeals, into account. This allows the court to weigh all the circumstances of the offence and all the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.</p><p>  Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 provides for the making of a compensation order (on application or otherwise) against a convicted person by the court instead of or in addition to dealing with the person in any other way, unless it sees reason to the contrary.  The Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against a sentence imposed if she believes it to be unduly lenient.  The Government is committed to a strategic review of penal policy, including sentencing, and I expect this review to get underway shortly.</p><p>  In addition, the Law Reform Commission is reviewing the law on mandatory sentences and published a consultation paper in January this year. The Commission invited submissions on its consultation paper from interested parties and will publish its final report in due course.  I will await the outcome of both these reviews and consider the recommendations made before taking any further action regarding the law on sentencing.</p></reply>

As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature. At the Joint Committee I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced one that would incorporate the anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues several of which have been of previous concern to Members. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee which I very much appreciate given the protracted history of this piece of legislation.  Work on the Bill will continue therefore, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General. It remains my objective under this new approach, and mindful of the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring the new Bill to Government for approval and publication later this year.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

It should be noted that this is the busiest time of the year for committals prior to the courts being in recess for the summer.  The average number of prisoners in custody in Ireland has risen in the last 5 years, from 3,321 during 2007 to 4,389 during 2011, an increase of over 32%. Likewise the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,318 in 2011 &ndash; an increase of over 45%.</p><p>Rising prisoner numbers have placed enormous strain on the prison system across the board from accommodation to the provision of services including work training/education, healthcare and drug treatment services.  As a result of the increase in the prison population, a number of prisons  are operating well in excess of their stated bed capacities.  There does appear, however, to be a stabilising or levelling off in the increase in prisoner numbers being committed annually with 2011 recording only a 0.8% increase on the previous year. This compares to increases of 13.6%, 13.8% and 11.4% respectively year on year for 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p><p>As outlined in the recently published Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  In 2012 and in the first quarter of 2013, priority will be given to reducing the chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick Prisons and the D&oacute;chas Centre.  The following table outlines the current bed capacity and the bed capacity as recommended by the Inspector of Prisons.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Institution</div></th><th><div>Current Bed Capacity</div></th><th><div>*Recommended Bed  Capacity as per Inspector of Prisons Report of July 2010</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Mountjoy (Male)</div></td><td><div>590</div></td><td><div>540</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Mountjoy (Female)</div></td><td><div>105</div></td><td><div>85</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>St. Patrick's Institution</div></td><td><div>217</div></td><td><div>218</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cork</div></td><td><div>250</div></td><td><div>146</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick (Male)</div></td><td><div>260</div></td><td><div>185</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick (Female)</div></td><td><div>34</div></td><td><div>24</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Castlerea</div></td><td><div>351</div></td><td><div>300</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cloverhill</div></td><td><div>431</div></td><td><div>446</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wheatfield</div></td><td><div>680</div></td><td><div>700</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Portlaoise</div></td><td><div>311</div></td><td><div>359</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Arbour Hill</div></td><td><div>148</div></td><td><div>131</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Midlands</div></td><td><div>610</div></td><td><div>477</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Training Unit</div></td><td><div>127</div></td><td><div>96</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Loughan House</div></td><td><div>140</div></td><td><div>160</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Shelton Abbey</div></td><td><div>113</div></td><td><div>110</div></td></tr></table></p><p>* These figures are currently being reviewed by the Irish Prison Service and the Inspector of Prisons.</p><p>Significant investment has taken place in our prison estate in recent years with in excess of 900 new prison spaces having been constructed and brought into use since 2007.

By 13 September  2012, 259 prisoners had participated in the scheme, with 142 having completed their required periods of community service.</p></reply>

As stated in the official declaration of the Conference (also known as the 'Vienna Declaration')  the aim of the declaration is  to seek to improve community health and safety by calling for the incorporation of scientific evidence into illicit drug policies.  The declaration calls on governments and international organisations to undertake a number of measures including a transparent review of the effectiveness of current drug policies, the implementation of a science-based public health approach to address individual and community harms stemming from illicit drug use, decriminalisation of drug users and the meaningful involvement of members of affected communities in developing services and policies etc. </p><p>  The Government's approach to tackling the problem of drug misuse is through a co-ordinated and integrated approach under the National Drugs Strategy 2009 to 2016 which was developed over an 18 month period and involved wide public consultation under the oversight of the Steering Group established for this purpose.  The Strategy tackles the issue of drug misuse under the pillar headings of drugs supply reduction, education and prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. The Strategy is being delivered,  under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State at the Department of Health Ro&iacute;sin Shortall TD,  by a number of Government Departments and agencies in partnership with the community and voluntary treatment sectors </p><p>  The Programme for Government affirms the Government commitment to tackling the problem of drug misuse  through the pillar based approach outlined in the Strategy and in partnership with relevant stakeholders.  The policy approach outlined in the Strategy is current Government policy in this area and, in the circumstances, there are no plans to adopt or endorse other policy statements in the matter. </p></reply>

Let me be clear that these so-called 'dissident republicans' are no more than criminal terrorists using violence in pursuit of their own, often personal, ends.  These groups maintain more than just a casual acquaintance with organised criminals in funding themselves and their activities.  Indeed, they are deeply involved in criminality. </p><p>  As the Deputy will now be aware, following the incidents at the funeral in North Dublin, the Garda Commissioner has set up a dedicated operation, &ldquo;Operation Ambience&rdquo;.  As a result, numerous searches were conducted of various locations in Dublin and surrounding counties and a substantial number of arrests were also made.  Three people have been charged with membership of an unlawful organisation under the Offences Against the State Act and Garda inquiries into the matter are ongoing.</p><p>  I am strongly committed to ensuring that the Garda&iacute; have the necessary resources they need, not just in terms of manpower and equipment, but also in terms of legislative provisions, to bear down on these so-called dissident groups. As recently as last June, I obtained the approval of the Oireachtas to renew certain provisions of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. These provisions include those of directing an unlawful organisation, unlawful collection of information and training in the use of firearms. </p></reply>

The purpose of the Commission is to facilitate the location of the remains of the Disappeared, those who were killed and buried secretly by paramilitaries over the course of the conflict, in order that they may be returned to their families to afford them some measure of closure.</p><p><br />  Together with the Northern Ireland Office Minister of State, I met with the two Commissioners, Mr. Frank Murray and Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, and the Commission&#8217;s investigators last year, in the context of a meeting with the families of the Disappeared.  I assured them of the continuing, full support of both Governments for the Commisson's work.  Officials in my Department and in the Northern Ireland Office maintain close and regular contact with the Commissioners and their investigation team.</p><p><br />  The Commission has emphasised that its work is driven by information.  All information provided to the Commission is treated as strictly confidential and everyone can be assured that such information can only be used to locate and identify the remains.  It cannot be given to other agencies or used for prosecutions.</p><p><br />  I know the House will join me in calling on anybody who has any information that could help to locate those still missing to give that information to the Commission without delay.  The Commission has in place a confidential freephone number and PO box address through which information can be passed to it.  More information about the Commission and its work, and how to contact it is available on the Commission&#8217;s website &#8211; <i>www.iclvr.ie</i></p><p><br />  I would emphasise to the House that the Commission&#8217;s task is a humanitarian one.

There are particular concerns in the United States where addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements are priorities for the Government in its contacts with the US Administration and Congress.     The Government&rsquo;s keen interest in a resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants is well recognised and accepted by our friends within US Administration and Congress. Their advice to us remains that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which this can be achieved. </p><p>  With a view to helping some positive momentum around immigration issues insofar as they relate to Ireland, enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary U.S. work visas has been a particular focus of our efforts.  If passed this would make 10,500 E-3 visas available to Irish citizens each year.</p><p>  While I am heartened by the advances that have been made so far towards bi-partisan consensus in the US Senate towards enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 visas, I am conscious that passing any immigration-related legislation in an election year in the US presents very significant challenges. Through our Embassy in Washington, the Government will continue to work closely with all relevant actors, including our friends in Congress and with Irish-American community representatives with a view to ensuring that every opportunity is taken to put an E-3 visa scheme in place.   Our friends on Capitol Hill have recently signalled however that further progress on immigration reform is unlikely before the US elections in November.</p></reply>

Turkey is currently in accession negotiations.  Accession may follow once the country fulfils the established membership criteria and provided that EU member States and the European Commission are satisfied that all the conditions have been met.  However, progress on Turkey&rsquo;s EU accession has been very slow of late, with the last Chapter in the negotiations opened in 2010.  Some 12 of the 33 negotiating Chapters have been officially opened and 1 provisionally closed.  Of the remaining 21 Chapters, negotiations on 8 of them have been suspended by the Council since December 2006, due to Turkey&rsquo;s failure to meet its obligations under the Ankara Protocol, i.e. normalisation of relations with Cyprus. The Council also agreed that it will not decide on provisionally closing Chapters until the Commission verifies that Turkey has fulfilled its commitments related to the Protocol. A further 4 Chapters remain frozen since the French Presidential Elections in 2007 and Cyprus is blocking another 6. This leaves 3 Chapters with a possibility of being opened.</p><p>  In the absence of movement in the enlargement negotiations, Turkey is still proceeding, nonetheless, with reforms including plans for a new Constitution, in part to bring it more in line with EU standards. In May this year the European Commission and Turkey launched a &lsquo;Positive Agenda&rsquo; to examine where progress might be possible on 8 Chapters.  This raises the possibility that the Irish Presidency may be able to open Chapters, if sufficient progress can be achieved.  Enlargement is a negotiated process and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predetermined. We will be working closely with Turkey, with the European Commission, and with our EU partners and will make every effort to move the agenda forward during our Presidency.  Minister of State Creighton visited Turkey in July this year, in part to discuss areas for possible progress during our Presidency. I hope to receive the Turkish Minister for European Affairs in Dublin later this year. </p></reply>

It is a multi-faceted issue that requires a co-ordinated and multi-faceted response.</p><p><br />  Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through its range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects.  Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&#8217;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available. Revenue is using a wide range of methodologies to identify those operating in the shadow economy and is deploying the full range of compliance interventions.  Activities can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as its audit and investigation programmes.  The Revenue&#8217;s approach to the shadow economy is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with the Department of Social Protection. The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration<b></b>  or under declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims.</p><p><br />  The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group provides a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy.  This group, which is chaired by Revenue, includes representatives from employer and business organisations, trade unions and other Government Departments and agencies.  Regional hidden economy liaison groups have been established to facilitate greater local interaction and more immediate responses to insights and issues that may be highlighted.  Increasingly Revenue is finding that bodies and individuals are prepared to share insights and specific information with regard to shadow economy activity.</p><p><br />  The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion, including recent provisions relating to:</p><p>- The making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers, and other payment settlement entities, to the Revenue Commissioners</p><p> - The more effective investigation of white-collar crime.</p><p>Other new provisions included a comprehensive package of measures in relation to Excise (Oils) including, requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place.</p><p><br />  Revenue&#8217;s tobacco strategy, &#8220;Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013)&#8221; was published on the Revenue website in June 2011. This three-year strategy is underpinned by annual action plans.  The strategic level plans include taking steps to ensure that the legitimate trade remains compliant, delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of Revenue resources.  The strategy also include further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at national and international level, together with a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.  During 2011 Revenue seized a total of 109m cigarettes in 10,581 seizures. Commercial quantities in maritime freight traffic accounted for 76.4m cigarettes.  Revenue also seized 11,158kg of tobacco in 2011. In six particular operations, over 19m cigarettes, 1,344 kgs tobacco and 49 vehicles were seized.</p><p><br />  Regulations were also introduced in 2011 requiring Government Departments and State Bodies to supply details to the Revenue Commissioners, of payments made. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this data is matched to the Revenue records of the various recipients, and is used to profile risk.  Similar matching is also carried out using other third party data received by the Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses.  All possible sources of information, including following up on services advertised on TV, radio, local newspapers, internet, special interest publications are used by Revenue.</p><p><br />  Revenue investigations have detected the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records.  To counteract these risks, legislation was enacted in 2011 providing penalties for the possession, use or supply of automated sales suppression devices known as &quot;zappers&quot; for the purpose of evading tax.  Streetscape programmes, in which every cash business in an area is visited, without prior announcement, have been carried out.  The main focus of real time activity is on businesses that have the potential to operate with cash.  This includes professionals such as doctors, veterinary surgeons, etc.  These operations have also resulted in the registration of previously unregistered persons. 803 such registrations were recorded in the period from January to the end of April 2012.</p><p><br />  The results from all the various projects are reflected in the general audit and compliance results from audits, assurance checks, site visits etc. which are published in the Revenue Annual Report.  Revenue does not measure the estimated loss to the Exchequer as a result of the black economy.  Revenue does report annually on the results of its audit and compliance programmes.  In 2011 the results of audit and assurance activities resulted in additional yield of &#8364;492.7m to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

That reply contains details, as advised to me by the Revenue Commissioners, of the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer relating to income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available.  The information relates to 2008 and 2009, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed information is available.</p><p>  The following tax reliefs have been terminated since 2008:</p><p>- Approved Share Options Schemes</p><p>- BIK (Benefit-in-kind) exemption on certain professional subscriptions</p><p>- BIK  exemption on employer-provided art objects in a heritage building or garden</p><p>- BIK exemption for employer provided childcare</p><p>- Capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure incurred on registered nursing homes, convalescent homes, qualifying hospitals and mental health centres (subject to transitional arrangements for pipeline projects)</p><p>- Capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, conversion or refurbishment of buildings used for childcare purposes</p><p>- Capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of residential units associated with registered nursing homes</p><p>- Consanguinity relief for residential property</p><p>- Enterprise Areas</p><p>- Exemption from income tax and associated marginal relief (Section 187)</p><p>- Exemption that applies to the first 6 weeks of Illness Benefit and Occupational Injury Benefit per annum (Section 126)</p><p>- Farm consolidation relief (expired)</p><p>- First time buyer&rsquo;s relief</p><p>- Holiday Cottages</p><p>- Living over the Shop</p><p>- Loans to acquire an interest in certain companies (phased abolition)</p><p>- Low value properties (residential property below &euro;127k and non-residential property below &euro;10k)</p><p>- Multi-storey car parks</p><p>- Park &amp; Ride</p><p>- Patent royalty exemption</p><p>- Premiums under qualifying long term care policies (Section 470A)</p><p>- Purchase of new houses</p><p>- Purchase of new shares by an employee</p><p>- Service charges</p><p>- Student Accommodation</p><p>- Trade Union Subscriptions</p><p>- Rent relief (phased abolition)</p><p>- Rural Renewal</p><p>- Site to child relief</p><p>- Town Renewal</p><p>- Urban Renewal</p><p>  In respect of the remaining reliefs, I would again refer the Deputy to my earlier answer as this contains the identifiable costs to the Exchequer of such reliefs. I would further note that, as with all measures of this nature, reliefs will be reviewed as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill cycle.  However, the Deputy will also be aware that it is not the practice of the Minister for Finance to discuss the precise or specific details of measures which may be under consideration as part of a future Budget and Finance Bill package.</p></reply>

The cost is written off at the rate of 15% of the cost in each of the first 6 years with the remaining 10% in year 7.  This compares favourably with other allowances for example, for industrial buildings and I have no plans to amend the capital allowance period for farm buildings at this time.</p></reply>

The legislation to give effect to this was introduced by way of Section 9 Finance Act 2012 and provides that the new 30% rate of tax relief applies to qualifying interest paid on a qualifying loan taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2008.  In addition, I have sought to be as flexible as possible within the constraints pertaining.  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period.  </p><p>  As with all time limited reliefs, there will always be people who just miss out, and that is why I have been as flexible as possible.  However, I do not intend to extend the parameters of the measure any further as it would become less targeted and more costly.</p></reply>

The most recent report by the Revenue Commissioners analysing the high income individuals' restriction is in respect of the 2010 tax year.  This report was published by my Department early last month and is available at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.  Table 3 of that report shows the total value of the underlying claims in respect of specified reliefs as being &#8364;373 million.  For illustration, if the total abolition of the relevant reliefs is what the Deputy has in mind, the full year yield, in terms of the 2010 claims, estimated at an assumed rate of income tax at 41%, would be in the order of &#8364;150 million.</p><p><br />  It would be important to undertake an evaluation of each individual specified relief and the socio-economic objectives which each was designed to encourage, before the abolition of any of the reliefs could be considered.  It is also important to note that many of the specified reliefs have already been abolished.  However, because of the nature of some of those reliefs, individuals have a right to claim them for a seven-year period.  There are a number of legal considerations that would hinder the abolition of the reliefs during such run down periods.</p></reply>

The Universal Social Charge (USC) is an individualised charge and as such the yield is calculated for individual incomes of more than &euro;100,000 rather than dual incomes of more than &euro;200,000.  On that basis I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, would be &euro;67 million.  The estimated yield is based on confining the 1 percentage point increase to the portion of income which is in excess of &euro;100,000, that is, the increase is not applied to the portion of total income earned up to &euro;100,000.  The figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim.  It is, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.</p></reply>

As I previously advised the Deputy, in response to his Parliamentary Questions of 25th January, 2012 and 19th July, 2012, differing pupil teacher ratios are applied under the GAM in relation to boys, girls and mixed schools in order to account for differentials of prevalence of learning difficulty between boys and girls.  The rationale for the differing ratios is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls. </p><p><br />  The NCSE Report on the Implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, of 2006, also examined a range of sources to establish prevalence rates, including national databases, local and international studies and expert estimates, which indicated significantly higher rates of Mild General Learning Difficulty and Specific Learning Disability prevailing in boys, in comparison to girls.  Revised arrangements to update schools' GAM allocations with effect from September 2012, based on the number of class teaching posts in schools for the previous year, reflect the previous arrangements for the allocation of supports under the GAM, which also provided for differentials in allocation between boys and girls schools. The criteria for the allocation of GAM hours are outlined in circular 007/2012 which is available on<i> www.education.ie</i>. </p></reply>

Accordingly, whereas I provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor the Department have legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regards to individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.</p><p>  In general, the Board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively, to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils in its care and, as employer, the Board also has responsibilities in relation to the action of its employees.  </p><p>  In dealing with parental complaints, my Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.  If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities. The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies. Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.  </p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative affect on a child. The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1, (Ph) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail oco@oco.ie.</p></reply>

This Act provided for the application of the pay reduction and the pension levy to serving members of the judiciary and provided for reduced remuneration rates for newly appointed members of the judiciary with effect from 1 January 2012. The Act also made provision to bring certain Office holders (Comptroller and Auditor General and Chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la) within the public service pay ceiling and for the reduction of remuneration for future appointees as President and the Office of Ombudsman. This legislation also formally provided for the reduction in the salary rates for members of the Government. Ongoing arrangements are being made on an administrative basis to implement the pay ceiling for future appointments where that is appropriate, for example within the Civil Service and the Heads of four Universities.</p><p>Based on the information available within my Department, there are 20 post holders in the public service and 93 Academic Consultants on approved salary levels in excess of &euro;200,000.

Expenditure on FIS for 2011 was of the order of &euro;204 million in respect of some 29,000 families. </p><p>  The payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he/she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with - or is in a family which is supported by - him/her.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.  On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.   This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities. </p><p>  However, once the 52 week period has expired, customers are invited to re-apply.  If at that stage they continue to satisfy the basic qualifying conditions their up-to-date family income will be assessed for FIS purposes and a change in rate will be approved if appropriate.  Accordingly where customers have had their overall family income reduced as a result of any reduction in One Parent Family Payment (OPFP) their FIS entitlement will be adjusted to reflect any income changes at this annual FIS review.  I have no plans at present to change these arrangements. </p></reply>

Because the State pension is a very valuable benefit it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  That is why there have been a number of changes to State Pension, including the move to 520 paid contributions from April 2012 as one of the qualifying conditions for State pension. </p><p>  People who leave the workplace for homemaking/caring purposes can, if eligible, avail of the homemakers scheme which helps to provide a higher rate of pension for those who meet the qualifying conditions.   </p><p>  It is important in assessing any rates of payment that we focus on the real impact of social welfare payments.  In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past.  This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &lsquo;risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010.  The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%.  If one examines deprivation rates from a gender perspective, it can be seen that in 2009, the deprivation rate of older men at 7.6% was lower than the deprivation rate of older women at 11.1%.  However, in 2010 this pattern has reversed and the data now shows us that older women suffer lower rates of deprivation at 6.9% compared to 11.8% for older men.</p><p>  Women who do not qualify for a pension or are affected by other changes to State pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.  A State pension non-contributory, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable. </p><p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund shows that, notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with short contribution histories can fare better than those with full contribution histories, which is of particular importance to women.  The report also shows that the Fund provides better value to female than to male contributors.  </p></reply>

The objective of the Programme was to realise higher energy efficiency standards in new housing, and underpin the move to a 40% mandatory standard, thus reducing energy usage and lowering CO2 emissions.</p><p>  Funding was paid on the basis of certified and receipted eligible expenditure. Grant aid of &euro;400,000 was paid to Carlinn Hall in 2008, in addition to &euro;16,000 for a Feasibility Study earlier that year.  Site visits were undertaken to visibly inspect and to ensure the specifications were being adhered to, and that all features were included as required under the terms of the contract.  The SEAI paid out on eligible expenditure only and no further payments were issued as there was no further expenditure on energy related features on the site.  The remaining grant offer (&euro;741,200) was revoked in November 2009 as no further payment requested were lodged with the SEAI.</p><p>  While it is regrettable that occupancy of the development is currently low, the fact that the remaining properties are back on the market will hopefully mean that families will ultimately benefit from the superior design and energy performance features.</p></reply>

The National Broadband Plan for Ireland commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:</p><p>- 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and </p><p>-A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Ballydesmond, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

Following extensive consideration of this matter, the Government announced in December last that it had decided not to proceed with legislation to abolish upward only rent reviews in existing commercial leases, i.e., those entered into prior to 28 February 2010.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.</p><p>  While legislative intervention may not be feasible, the Minister for Finance has outlined the role which NAMA can play in dealing with the problems caused by upward only rent reviews which apply to NAMA properties.  NAMA has published its policy guidance which will inform the approach to be taken where relevant tenants are experiencing difficulties in paying rents.  Where there is a failure to reach agreement on revised contracts the policy guidance provides an opportunity for NAMA to approve rent reductions where it can be shown that rents are in excess of market levels, and that the viability of the tenant is threatened.  The policy also provides for the appointment of an independent valuer to ascertain current market rent.  Where a tenant is not getting satisfaction he or she can contact NAMA directly.</p><p>  There are no plans to establish an Arbitration Tribunal to deal exclusively with rent review disputes.   However, there is a rent review arbitration code in being which was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The code provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.  A particular feature of the code is that it contains detailed provisions dealing with the production of comparative evidence in relation to property transactions.  It also places a firm duty on all parties to disclose all relevant information which is in their possession.   As matters stand, parties are free to specify that this code should apply in relation to rent review arbitrations and I would encourage all parties to make use of its provisions.</p></reply>

The new legislation provides for the establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) to licence, control and regulate Property Service Providers (i.e. auctioneers/estate agents, letting agents and management agents). The new PSRA licensing system came into effect on 6 July 2012. The date of 6 July was chosen because, since 1947 when the licensing of auctioneers and house agents was first introduced, licences fell due for renewal annually on 6 July.</p><p>  Under the 2011 Act, any person wishing to engage in the provision of property services must obtain a licence from the PSRA. A person providing a property service without a licence is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.  A comprehensive <b><i>Guide to Becoming a Licensed Property Services Provider</i></b>   was published in June 2012 and sent to every person holding a licence under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973. This guide is also available on the Authority's website, www.psr.ie.</p><p>  At present the PSRA is engaged in the processing of some 5,000 licence applications. To date all applications have been acknowledged. Transitional provisions under the 2011 Act provide that applicants, which would include small auctioneering firms, who have applied for a licence from the PSRA before 6 July 2012 and who previously held a licence under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts, can continue to provide the property service concerned until their licence application has been determined.

Work has been underway in my Department since then on the preparation of the Heads of a Bill. I expect I will be in a position to bring the Heads to Government later this term for its approval and agreement to proceed to formal drafting.</p><p>  The proposed new legislation will establish a new and comprehensive regulatory system for both betting and gaming under the collective term 'gambling'. The Deputy might wish to note that gaming includes lotteries other than the National Lottery. The new system will replace the arrangements currently in place under the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956; both Acts, as amended, are to be repealed by the new legislation.  The Bill will, for the first time, set up a licensing system for small to medium sized casinos. It will also cover all forms of remote gambling, including gambling by telephone or on-line. </p><p>  I have prioritised the need for effective safeguards and as a result the new legislation will contain numerous measures to protect consumers, in particular those persons who are vulnerable because they are young or have addiction or other difficulties.   In line with the Government's decision, all regulatory functions, including licensing and compliance activities, will be brought together under the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>  I believe we now have an opportunity to frame a regulatory system appropriate to modern circumstances and it is clear to me that this opportunity should be used to maximum effect. I will therefore be open to proposals that will improve on the Heads and will be proposing to the Government that the Heads should be made available on my Department's website when they have been approved and while drafting is under way. This will allow interested parties to learn about the Government's overall position. It will also enable them to draw attention to issues that may need further consideration before a Bill is finalised.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, violent crime manifests itself in a number of different ways, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analyses and addresses each using appropriately targeted measures.  In particular, the Policing Plan for 2012 includes as a strategic goal the objective of confronting serious crime in all its forms, including crimes against the person as well as organised and violent crime. </p><p>  The Garda&iacute; employ multi-disciplinary, intelligence-led approaches to ensure the activities and resources of individuals and groups involved in all criminal enterprises, including armed and other violent crime, are effectively targeted.   At the present time, the Garda authorities have in place a number of intelligence led operations focusing on violent organised crime groups, as a direct result of which a number of individuals are before the courts charged with serious offences, up to and including murder.</p><p>  Violent crime also manifests itself in the context of public disorder and street violence, often associated with excessive drinking.  The Garda&iacute; proactively target areas which are 'hotspots' for such criminality and take appropriate action, using the strong legal powers available to them under the Public Order Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  Dealing with the violence that arises from excessive drinking is not simply about policing, however, and requires actions by parents, by educators and by those who sell alcohol, not only in public houses, but right across the retail sector.  For my part I intend to work to improve our regulatory framework with a view to curbing the level of excessive drinking. </p><p>  I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner who is in a position to advise me in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's expert analysis of the crime problems faced in our society and will respond appropriately to any issues which the Commissioner might bring to my attention.</p></reply>

This means, among other things, reducing expenditure on public service pay, whether by reducing headcount or otherwise.  This is particularly so in those public service bodies where pay forms an especially large part of overall expenditure, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where 90% of expenditure is on pay and pensions.  The current and projected Garda budgets will therefore necessitate a significant reduction in Garda expenditure.  This will undoubtedly require further reductions in Garda numbers.  This has been well known for some time, dating right back to when the last Government was in office and the question of exact level of the reductions required will depend on the potential for alternative savings which could mitigate the scale of the reduction in head count required.  In this context, the Department of Justice and Equality is engaging in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter and it would not be appropriate to comment further on this at this point in time.</p></reply>

Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. </p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.   I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public. My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.

In that context the position is that, in making his recommendations on the closure of each Garda station, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, I am advised  by the Garda authorities that all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area. It must be stressed that the key objective of any station closure is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Whitehall Garda station premises forms part of the portfolio of State properties owned and maintained by the Office of Public Works and  I am advised that they have previously undertaken maintenance works at the station with a view to securing the overall fabric of the building.  Expenditure on the relevant refurbishment works was undertaken from the Vote of the Office of Public Works.  The question of the possible future use of the property is also a matter for the Office of Public Works and I understand that they are open to proposals as to how best to utilise the premises. </p></reply>

In 2010, the then Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this Battlegroup. The other members of the Austro-German Battlegroup are Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Our contribution is a Reconnaissance Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force Headquarters amounting to approximately 175 personnel. During the standby period one officer has been deployed to the Battlegroup Headquarters in Ulm, Germany. This officer is engaged in training and planning activities.</p><p>  Ireland has previously participated in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2008 and 2011.  The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup were Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway, Estonia and Croatia (2011 only).  Any decision by Ireland to participate in a specific Battlegroup operation is subject to our national sovereign decision-making procedures - &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo;, i.e. UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval.</p><p>  The capabilities and the requisite high-end equipment in respect of Ireland's contributions to the Battlegroups already reside within the Defence Forces.  No military equipment has been purchased specifically for EU Battlegroups.  Training of the manoeuvre elements of the Austro-German Battlegroup took place in the contributing Member States - Irish troops were trained in Ireland.  Unlike the Nordic Battlegroup, there were no joint field exercises or manoeuvre training with other elements in the Austro-German Battlegroup.  Battlegroup training in Ireland is part and parcel of the overall programme of training for rapid deployment elements of the Defence Forces for overseas operations and, in the case of the current Battlegroup, comprises mainly the standard training of reconnaissance formations.  As such, any additional training costs are marginal.</p><p>  Under the Battlegroup Concept, Battlegroups are designed to be operational within 5-10 days of approval from the Council of the European Union and must be sustainable for at least 30 days which could be extended to 120 days, if resupplied.  Based on previous deployments, the current estimated additional cost for a maximum 120 day Battlegroup deployment is &euro;10.7 million (excluding allowances and ammunition which are generally already provided for in the Defence Vote).  This cost will arise in 2012 only if the Battlegroup is actually deployed.  There are no proposals under consideration at this time for the deployment of the Austro/German Battlegroup.  Additional costs if the Battlegroup is deployed for a period of longer than 4 months should not arise as the Battlegroup concept only allows for a deployment of 120 days.  </p></reply>

I recently discussed the issue of ratification of this Protocol in a meeting with UN Special Representative on Violence Against Children which took place in my Department on 11th June last, during the Special Representative's official visit to Ireland. We agreed that the matter would be prioritised following the Children's Referendum, submission of the State's next report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the setting up of the new Child and Family Support Agency. The latter will also facilitate ratification of the Protocol which, as you will be aware, can only take place when the Government is satisfied that it able to meet all its obligations under the Protocol. </p><p>  Many of the criminal law provisions of the Optional Protocol to the Convention have already been implemented in existing domestic legislation.  Legislative proposals that the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to bring to Government in the coming months will, I understand, facilitate compliance with the criminal law requirements of the Optional Protocol and other international related legal instruments.  It is also proposed to put in place the necessary administrative procedures and arrangements to allow for accession and, subject to the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, it is proposed to ratify the Optional Protocol and related international legal instruments as soon as is practicable.

These include representatives from the HSE, local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, VECs, National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, Irish Primary Principals Network, NEWB, and other organisations who provide services to children and young people.  There are a total of 16 such committees.</p><p><br />  The membership of all Children Services Committees (CSCs) includes senior managers from the major statutory providers of services to children and families.  The Chairperson of each CSC is either the HSE Local Health Area Manager or the Area Manager for Children and Family Services and it is their function to ensure that the Children&#8217;s Services Committees secures better developmental outcomes for children through more effective integration of existing services and interventions at local level.  One of these outcomes is that all children should be <i>&#8220;healthy, both physically and mentally&#8221;.</i></p><p><br />  In addition, members of the National Children&#8217;s Strategy Implementation Group  (NCSIG) are drawn from a number of Government Departments and agencies.  The Department of Health is  represented on this group at Assistant Secretary level, and the HSE is represented by the National Director for Children &amp; Family Supports, the Assistant National Director for Children &amp; Families, the National Specialist for Family Support, and by the Chairs of Limerick City and Dublin City CSC.</p><p><br />  As you may be aware, I established a Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency (CFSA) in 2011 and it presented its findings to my Department in July of this year.  One of the recommendations of the Task Force is that service delivery model should be focused on <i>improving well-being and outcomes</i> for children based on the five national outcomes which includes, as I mentioned earlier, that all children  should be <i>&#8220;healthy, both physically and mentally&#8221;.</i></p><p><br />  I am satisfied that taking all of these actions into consideration that the delivery of child and family services can be carried out by blending mental health interventions, primary care, public health nursing, youth justice, domestic violence supports, community outreach, child protection and child welfare as well as numerous other functions into one efficient, coherent service.  Where CSCs have established priority actions around child &amp; adolescent mental health the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) practitioners are involved in the delivery of those priority areas.  The forthcoming Children and Young People's Policy Framework will address the further development of these committees, and the role of the CAMHS will be considered in that context.</p></reply>

These include recommendations on a range of services, including Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, which, in the opinion of the Task Force, should fall within the remit of the new Agency. </p><p>  The Task Force recommendations are being given detailed consideration in preparing for the establishment of the new Agency, and I will bring proposals to Government in this regard. It is my intention that the Child and Family Support Agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in early 2013. The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority.  I share with the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support, and therapeutic and care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p></reply>

No. 325 of 2012, which I signed into Irish law on 27 August.   The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority under the Regulations and it must authorise donation and transplantation in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations.  The Regulations apply to donation, procurement, testing, characterisation, transport and transplantation of organs.  They set out a clear legal framework for the application of quality and safety standards for human organs intended for transplantation.</p><p>  My Department is working with the HSE and the IMB to ensure that hospitals meet the requirements in the Regulations. The HSE's National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office is overseeing the development of guidance documents, which will set out the appropriate processes and procedures to comply with quality and safety standards for all aspects of donation and transplantation.  It is also assisting hospitals through its National Transplant Advisory Group, to comply with the Regulations.  I am confident that hospitals will meet the requirements of the Regulations, when they are inspected by the IMB.  Compliance with the Regulations will assure both donors and organ recipients that the organ donation and transplantation system is operating in accordance with the best possible standards of quality and safety.</p></reply>

In the short term, to address the 2012 position, a range of measures are being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget.  These include the use of capital to fund revenue on a once-off basis and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis.  The HSE has been required to review all pay and non-pay savings targets with a view to further targeting all areas which do not compromise patient safety.</p><p><br />  The HSE has indicated that it will achieve &#8364;130m in savings to address the deficit.  Nearly 50%<b></b>will come from more focused cash and stock management initiatives, savings in medical equipment (non-capital), furniture, education, training, office expenses, travel and subsistence and advertising.  &#8364;6m of savings will come from the non-reimbursement of certain non-essential products. &#8364;60.5m of savings will come from specific service-related measures.  These measures are now the subject of intensive discussions with the HSE and local stakeholders.  I have instructed the Executive that efficiencies must be achieved in the first instance before patient services are affected and in this regard, patient safety must be paramount.</p></reply>

A total of10,108 internships have commenced to date with 4,798 participants currently on an internship as at 13<sup></sup>September 2012 and over 2,056 opportunities presently advertised on .  Our records indicate that almost 38% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge have progressed into employment immediately on completion of their internship placements.  This represents very significant progress in a short period of time as well as comparing very favourably with European averages.  However it is important to note that this does not take into account of interns who may have secured employment in the subsequent weeks or months after completing their internship.  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the forthcoming formal evaluation of JobBridge</p><p><br />  This independent evaluation of the Scheme is being undertaken at the moment by Indecon International Economic Consultants.  This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and progression into employment.  The report to be published later this year it will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the scheme.</p></reply>

Expenditure on FIS for 2011 was of the order of &euro;204 million in respect of some 29,000 families. </p><p>  The payment preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he/she was unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with - or is in a family which is supported by - him/her.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.  On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.   This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities. </p><p>  However, once the 52 week period has expired, customers are invited to re-apply.  If at that stage they continue to satisfy the basic qualifying conditions their up-to-date family income will be assessed for FIS purposes and a change in rate will be approved if appropriate.  Accordingly where customers have had their overall family income reduced as a result of any reduction in One Parent Family Payment (OPFP) their FIS entitlement will be adjusted to reflect any income changes at this annual FIS review.  I have no plans at present to change these arrangements. </p></reply>

Because the State pension is a very valuable benefit it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  That is why there have been a number of changes to State Pension, including the move to 520 paid contributions from April 2012 as one of the qualifying conditions for State pension. </p><p>  People who leave the workplace for homemaking/caring purposes can, if eligible, avail of the homemakers scheme which helps to provide a higher rate of pension for those who meet the qualifying conditions.   </p><p>  It is important in assessing any rates of payment that we focus on the real impact of social welfare payments.  In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past.  This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &lsquo;risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010.  The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%.  If one examines deprivation rates from a gender perspective, it can be seen that in 2009, the deprivation rate of older men at 7.6% was lower than the deprivation rate of older women at 11.1%.  However, in 2010 this pattern has reversed and the data now shows us that older women suffer lower rates of deprivation at 6.9% compared to 11.8% for older men.</p><p>  Women who do not qualify for a pension or are affected by other changes to State pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.  A State pension non-contributory, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable. </p><p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund shows that, notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with short contribution histories can fare better than those with full contribution histories, which is of particular importance to women.  The report also shows that the Fund provides better value to female than to male contributors.  </p></reply>

The objective of the Programme was to realise higher energy efficiency standards in new housing, and underpin the move to a 40% mandatory standard, thus reducing energy usage and lowering CO2 emissions.</p><p>  Funding was paid on the basis of certified and receipted eligible expenditure. Grant aid of &euro;400,000 was paid to Carlinn Hall in 2008, in addition to &euro;16,000 for a Feasibility Study earlier that year.  Site visits were undertaken to visibly inspect and to ensure the specifications were being adhered to, and that all features were included as required under the terms of the contract.  The SEAI paid out on eligible expenditure only and no further payments were issued as there was no further expenditure on energy related features on the site.  The remaining grant offer (&euro;741,200) was revoked in November 2009 as no further payment requested were lodged with the SEAI.</p><p>  While it is regrettable that occupancy of the development is currently low, the fact that the remaining properties are back on the market will hopefully mean that families will ultimately benefit from the superior design and energy performance features.</p></reply>

The National Broadband Plan for Ireland commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:</p><p>- 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and </p><p>-A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.

Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.

Following extensive consideration of this matter, the Government announced in December last that it had decided not to proceed with legislation to abolish upward only rent reviews in existing commercial leases, i.e., those entered into prior to 28 February 2010.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.</p><p>  While legislative intervention may not be feasible, the Minister for Finance has outlined the role which NAMA can play in dealing with the problems caused by upward only rent reviews which apply to NAMA properties.  NAMA has published its policy guidance which will inform the approach to be taken where relevant tenants are experiencing difficulties in paying rents.  Where there is a failure to reach agreement on revised contracts the policy guidance provides an opportunity for NAMA to approve rent reductions where it can be shown that rents are in excess of market levels, and that the viability of the tenant is threatened.  The policy also provides for the appointment of an independent valuer to ascertain current market rent.  Where a tenant is not getting satisfaction he or she can contact NAMA directly.</p><p>  There are no plans to establish an Arbitration Tribunal to deal exclusively with rent review disputes.   However, there is a rent review arbitration code in being which was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The code provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.  A particular feature of the code is that it contains detailed provisions dealing with the production of comparative evidence in relation to property transactions.  It also places a firm duty on all parties to disclose all relevant information which is in their possession.   As matters stand, parties are free to specify that this code should apply in relation to rent review arbitrations and I would encourage all parties to make use of its provisions.</p></reply>

The new legislation provides for the establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) to licence, control and regulate Property Service Providers (i.e. auctioneers/estate agents, letting agents and management agents). The new PSRA licensing system came into effect on 6 July 2012. The date of 6 July was chosen because, since 1947 when the licensing of auctioneers and house agents was first introduced, licences fell due for renewal annually on 6 July.</p><p>  Under the 2011 Act, any person wishing to engage in the provision of property services must obtain a licence from the PSRA. A person providing a property service without a licence is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.  A comprehensive <b><i>Guide to Becoming a Licensed Property Services Provider</i></b>   was published in June 2012 and sent to every person holding a licence under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973. This guide is also available on the Authority's website, www.psr.ie.</p><p>  At present the PSRA is engaged in the processing of some 5,000 licence applications. To date all applications have been acknowledged. Transitional provisions under the 2011 Act provide that applicants, which would include small auctioneering firms, who have applied for a licence from the PSRA before 6 July 2012 and who previously held a licence under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts, can continue to provide the property service concerned until their licence application has been determined. Such applicants have been advised accordingly by the Authority.</p></reply>

Work has been underway in my Department since then on the preparation of the Heads of a Bill. I expect I will be in a position to bring the Heads to Government later this term for its approval and agreement to proceed to formal drafting.</p><p>  The proposed new legislation will establish a new and comprehensive regulatory system for both betting and gaming under the collective term 'gambling'. The Deputy might wish to note that gaming includes lotteries other than the National Lottery. The new system will replace the arrangements currently in place under the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956; both Acts, as amended, are to be repealed by the new legislation.  The Bill will, for the first time, set up a licensing system for small to medium sized casinos. It will also cover all forms of remote gambling, including gambling by telephone or on-line. </p><p>  I have prioritised the need for effective safeguards and as a result the new legislation will contain numerous measures to protect consumers, in particular those persons who are vulnerable because they are young or have addiction or other difficulties.   In line with the Government's decision, all regulatory functions, including licensing and compliance activities, will be brought together under the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>  I believe we now have an opportunity to frame a regulatory system appropriate to modern circumstances and it is clear to me that this opportunity should be used to maximum effect. I will therefore be open to proposals that will improve on the Heads and will be proposing to the Government that the Heads should be made available on my Department's website when they have been approved and while drafting is under way. This will allow interested parties to learn about the Government's overall position. It will also enable them to draw attention to issues that may need further consideration before a Bill is finalised.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, violent crime manifests itself in a number of different ways, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analyses and addresses each using appropriately targeted measures.  In particular, the Policing Plan for 2012 includes as a strategic goal the objective of confronting serious crime in all its forms, including crimes against the person as well as organised and violent crime. </p><p>  The Garda&iacute; employ multi-disciplinary, intelligence-led approaches to ensure the activities and resources of individuals and groups involved in all criminal enterprises, including armed and other violent crime, are effectively targeted.   At the present time, the Garda authorities have in place a number of intelligence led operations focusing on violent organised crime groups, as a direct result of which a number of individuals are before the courts charged with serious offences, up to and including murder.</p><p>  Violent crime also manifests itself in the context of public disorder and street violence, often associated with excessive drinking.  The Garda&iacute; proactively target areas which are 'hotspots' for such criminality and take appropriate action, using the strong legal powers available to them under the Public Order Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  Dealing with the violence that arises from excessive drinking is not simply about policing, however, and requires actions by parents, by educators and by those who sell alcohol, not only in public houses, but right across the retail sector.  For my part I intend to work to improve our regulatory framework with a view to curbing the level of excessive drinking. </p><p>  I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner who is in a position to advise me in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's expert analysis of the crime problems faced in our society and will respond appropriately to any issues which the Commissioner might bring to my attention.</p></reply>

This is particularly so in those public service bodies where pay forms an especially large part of overall expenditure, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where 90% of expenditure is on pay and pensions.  The current and projected Garda budgets will therefore necessitate a significant reduction in Garda expenditure.  This will undoubtedly require further reductions in Garda numbers.  This has been well known for some time, dating right back to when the last Government was in office and the question of exact level of the reductions required will depend on the potential for alternative savings which could mitigate the scale of the reduction in head count required.  In this context, the Department of Justice and Equality is engaging in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter and it would not be appropriate to comment further on this at this point in time.</p></reply>

Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. </p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.   I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public. My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided. I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.  I will bring proposals to Government on the matter in the near future.</p></reply>

In 2010, the then Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this Battlegroup. The other members of the Austro-German Battlegroup are Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Our contribution is a Reconnaissance Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force Headquarters amounting to approximately 175 personnel. During the standby period one officer has been deployed to the Battlegroup Headquarters in Ulm, Germany. This officer is engaged in training and planning activities.</p><p>  Ireland has previously participated in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2008 and 2011.  The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup were Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway, Estonia and Croatia (2011 only).  Any decision by Ireland to participate in a specific Battlegroup operation is subject to our national sovereign decision-making procedures - &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo;, i.e. UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval.</p><p>  The capabilities and the requisite high-end equipment in respect of Ireland's contributions to the Battlegroups already reside within the Defence Forces.  No military equipment has been purchased specifically for EU Battlegroups.  Training of the manoeuvre elements of the Austro-German Battlegroup took place in the contributing Member States - Irish troops were trained in Ireland.  Unlike the Nordic Battlegroup, there were no joint field exercises or manoeuvre training with other elements in the Austro-German Battlegroup.  Battlegroup training in Ireland is part and parcel of the overall programme of training for rapid deployment elements of the Defence Forces for overseas operations and, in the case of the current Battlegroup, comprises mainly the standard training of reconnaissance formations.  As such, any additional training costs are marginal.</p><p>  Under the Battlegroup Concept, Battlegroups are designed to be operational within 5-10 days of approval from the Council of the European Union and must be sustainable for at least 30 days which could be extended to 120 days, if resupplied.  Based on previous deployments, the current estimated additional cost for a maximum 120 day Battlegroup deployment is &euro;10.7 million (excluding allowances and ammunition which are generally already provided for in the Defence Vote).  This cost will arise in 2012 only if the Battlegroup is actually deployed.  There are no proposals under consideration at this time for the deployment of the Austro/German Battlegroup.  Additional costs if the Battlegroup is deployed for a period of longer than 4 months should not arise as the Battlegroup concept only allows for a deployment of 120 days.  </p></reply>

I recently discussed the issue of ratification of this Protocol in a meeting with UN Special Representative on Violence Against Children which took place in my Department on 11th June last, during the Special Representative's official visit to Ireland. We agreed that the matter would be prioritised following the Children's Referendum, submission of the State's next report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the setting up of the new Child and Family Support Agency. The latter will also facilitate ratification of the Protocol which, as you will be aware, can only take place when the Government is satisfied that it able to meet all its obligations under the Protocol. </p><p>  Many of the criminal law provisions of the Optional Protocol to the Convention have already been implemented in existing domestic legislation.  Legislative proposals that the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to bring to Government in the coming months will, I understand, facilitate compliance with the criminal law requirements of the Optional Protocol and other international related legal instruments.  It is also proposed to put in place the necessary administrative procedures and arrangements to allow for accession and, subject to the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, it is proposed to ratify the Optional Protocol and related international legal instruments as soon as is practicable. It would be my intention in due course to bring a Joint memo to Government with Minister Shatter to enable Ireland to ratify the second Optional Protocol.</p></reply>

These include representatives from the HSE, local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, VECs, National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, Irish Primary Principals Network, NEWB, and other organisations who provide services to children and young people.  There are a total of 16 such committees.</p><p><br />  The membership of all Children Services Committees (CSCs) includes senior managers from the major statutory providers of services to children and families.  The Chairperson of each CSC is either the HSE Local Health Area Manager or the Area Manager for Children and Family Services and it is their function to ensure that the Children&#8217;s Services Committees secures better developmental outcomes for children through more effective integration of existing services and interventions at local level.  One of these outcomes is that all children should be <i>&#8220;healthy, both physically and mentally&#8221;.</i></p><p><br />  In addition, members of the National Children&#8217;s Strategy Implementation Group  (NCSIG) are drawn from a number of Government Departments and agencies.  The Department of Health is  represented on this group at Assistant Secretary level, and the HSE is represented by the National Director for Children &amp; Family Supports, the Assistant National Director for Children &amp; Families, the National Specialist for Family Support, and by the Chairs of Limerick City and Dublin City CSC.</p><p><br />  As you may be aware, I established a Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency (CFSA) in 2011 and it presented its findings to my Department in July of this year.  One of the recommendations of the Task Force is that service delivery model should be focused on <i>improving well-being and outcomes</i> for children based on the five national outcomes which includes, as I mentioned earlier, that all children  should be <i>&#8220;healthy, both physically and mentally&#8221;.</i></p><p><br />  I am satisfied that taking all of these actions into consideration that the delivery of child and family services can be carried out by blending mental health interventions, primary care, public health nursing, youth justice, domestic violence supports, community outreach, child protection and child welfare as well as numerous other functions into one efficient, coherent service.  Where CSCs have established priority actions around child &amp; adolescent mental health the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) practitioners are involved in the delivery of those priority areas.  The forthcoming Children and Young People's Policy Framework will address the further development of these committees, and the role of the CAMHS will be considered in that context.</p></reply>

It is my intention that the Child and Family Support Agency will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in early 2013. The necessary legislation is being prepared by my Department as a priority.  I share with the view of the Task Force that in order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency must have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support, and therapeutic and care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p></reply>

The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority under the Regulations and it must authorise donation and transplantation in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations.  The Regulations apply to donation, procurement, testing, characterisation, transport and transplantation of organs.  They set out a clear legal framework for the application of quality and safety standards for human organs intended for transplantation.</p><p>  My Department is working with the HSE and the IMB to ensure that hospitals meet the requirements in the Regulations. The HSE's National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office is overseeing the development of guidance documents, which will set out the appropriate processes and procedures to comply with quality and safety standards for all aspects of donation and transplantation.  It is also assisting hospitals through its National Transplant Advisory Group, to comply with the Regulations.  I am confident that hospitals will meet the requirements of the Regulations, when they are inspected by the IMB.  Compliance with the Regulations will assure both donors and organ recipients that the organ donation and transplantation system is operating in accordance with the best possible standards of quality and safety.</p></reply>

In the short term, to address the 2012 position, a range of measures are being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget.  These include the use of capital to fund revenue on a once-off basis and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis.  The HSE has been required to review all pay and non-pay savings targets with a view to further targeting all areas which do not compromise patient safety.</p><p><br />  The HSE has indicated that it will achieve &#8364;130m in savings to address the deficit.  Nearly 50%<b></b>will come from more focused cash and stock management initiatives, savings in medical equipment (non-capital), furniture, education, training, office expenses, travel and subsistence and advertising.  &#8364;6m of savings will come from the non-reimbursement of certain non-essential products. &#8364;60.5m of savings will come from specific service-related measures.  These measures are now the subject of intensive discussions with the HSE and local stakeholders.  I have instructed the Executive that efficiencies must be achieved in the first instance before patient services are affected and in this regard, patient safety must be paramount.</p></reply>
