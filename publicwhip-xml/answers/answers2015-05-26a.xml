To facilitate a focussed discussion, 4 national-level Travellers NGOs have recently agreed a formal statement of what they are seeking and what they envisage such recognition will achieve in practical terms as well as in terms of the status and position of Travellers in Irish society.</p>  <p>  The contents of this statement, which was received in recent days, are currently being considered.  My Department will now engage further with other Departments and will as appropriate seek further legal advice.  I also intend to host a round-table discussion with relevant Government Departments and Traveller representatives shortly, following which I will bring forward recommendations to Government on the issue.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-26a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600053#WRA00900"><p>In an answer to a previous question I explained how Garda recruitment recommenced in September 2014, for the first time since 2009. Since then, 300 Garda recruits have been taken into the Garda College and the first group have already attested and are now full members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition I have secured sanction for the recruitment of a further 250 Garda recruits later this year and the selection process for that is under way.</p>  <p>  While it is the Government's intention that there will be ongoing seamless recruitment to the Force, it is not just a question of Garda numbers. The Government is also committed to ensuring that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are adequately equipped and have the appropriate  technical resources and the associated skilled and professional personnel to support the Garda&iacute; in their work.</p>  <p>  I am sure the House will agree that out-dated paper-based practices must be consigned to history and policing must move into the digital era. The recent report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Management has highlighted many of the issues that need to be addressed.  This will require resources, but it will also require a clear vision as to how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will deliver the policing service in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  With my support, the Commissioner has already established a multi-agency working group to develop a coherent long-term ICT strategy in the wider context of the reform process. This Group is examining the types of systems required and the scale of investment necessary. This work is vital in providing a firm, evidence-based justification for additional investment which I know will be considered carefully by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,  Brendan Howlin, in the context of the forthcoming multi-annual Capital Investment Framework.</p></reply>

It will be important to learn from international experience, and I have asked my Department to evaluate how the Community Court model will work in the Irish context, drawing from best practice, with a view to setting up a Community Court on a pilot basis in the Dublin city centre area.  I envisage an initial project where stakeholders will engage in partnership, in conjunction with the local business community.</p>  <p>  It was not possible to progress the initiative during 2014 due to the need to dedicate resources to other priority projects including the establishment of the new Court of Appeal and also to progress other ongoing projects, such as the judicial appointments review and the reform of the family law courts. However, I can assure the Deputy that the matter is currently under active consideration in my Department and it is my intention that the proposal will be further progressed in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Community Court is a problem-solving court and the model operates in different ways in different jurisdictions. Work commenced on setting parameters for a pilot last week with a meeting brokered by my Department among the key Justice sector stakeholders. This meeting confirmed that a considerable amount of preparatory work will need to be undertaken in collaboration with all stakeholders - both within the Justice sector and the wider community of agencies and groups whose active participation and buy in will be necessary -  before the pilot project can be established successfully. Proper planning is essential and a needs assessment will first be undertaken to guide the identification of the goals and priority objectives of the pilot Community Court. It is also essential that the proposal is fully evaluated to ensure that it delivers the required results. Each of the stakeholders involved is operating with limited resources so the preparation and planning stages of the project are essential to ensure that the resources involved are used effectively. It is also important that the project would operate in a fully integrated way.  The Justice sector  group which met last week has identified a number of steps to be taken pending a further meeting to be held in June and my Department will be actively progressing consideration of the Community Court proposal in the coming months.</p></reply>

They have been asked to examine the papers in each case with a view to determining whether further action is warranted and practical.</p>  <p>  A total of 319 complaints were referred to the panel of counsel.  I should say that the volume and complexity of cases has led to the review taking longer than originally anticipated.  However, I'm sure that Deputies will agree that it is important that counsel take the time necessary to consider each case fully and carefully. Indeed, the very number and variety of cases makes the work of counsel all the more important.  There are many cases which have already been through some form of process, whether that involves the courts or GSOC or some other body.  The issues in the cases also range considerably, from tragic deaths to property disputes.  Clearly such a number and range of cases must be carefully triaged to see if further action is warranted.</p>  <p>  While the review of all the allegations is not yet completed, my Department has received the recommendations of counsel in a significant number of cases. I have now received the first batch of submissions on these cases and clearly I want to start the process of writing to everyone concerned as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I will consider the recommendations of counsel extremely seriously, and as a general comment let me say that I cannot easily imagine circumstances where I would not follow such recommendations.  In communicating with individuals, I am also anxious not only to set out the recommendation of counsel and my decision on it, but to outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.  The legal advice of counsel contains in many cases comments relating to third parties, and clearly great care will have to be taken in setting out the main points made by counsel in a way which respects the rights of everyone concerned.</p>  <p>  This process will therefore have to be carefully and appropriately managed, so as to reflect the independence and objectivity which have been the hallmark of this process to date.</p>  <p>  I have therefore decided to appoint a former judicial figure to advise on the preparation of the letters.  I believe it is better to take that time now so as to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish.  I hope the House can accept that what I have decided about communicating decisions is the right course of action to take.</p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate to publish individual recommendations, I have considered how best information on the outcome of this process could be made public.  In this regard, I have asked counsel, in addition to making recommendations in individual cases, to produce a general overview of the issues and trends which featured in this process. I believe that this may lead to the identification of issues and recommendation for change across a number of areas, which I hope will enable us to address some of the general and thematic concerns raised by those persons whose cases were examined by counsel.  The report, when received, will be published by me.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-26a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600053#WRA01500"><p>On 6 May 2015 the Government agreed to the drafting of the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill.</p><p>The proposed Bill will implement a number of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) in relation to the enforcement of debt.  The<b><i></i></b>LRC Report published in 2010 on <i>Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement</i>made a number of recommendations for wide scale reform of the existing personal insolvency and debt enforcement regimes.  Key elements of that Report in relation to insolvency and measures to assist in the resolution of personal indebtedness were implemented through enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.</p><p>The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill seeks to implement further recommendations of the Report aimed at enforcement and recovery of debts which could be developed to streamline the existing enforcement procedures which are available to creditors. There is a need for a balanced approach in relation to civil debt to ensure the protection of creditor rights by making available a range of legal mechanisms which compel payment by &ldquo;won&rsquo;t pay&rdquo; debtors who knowingly refuse to pay their obligations.<b></b>Creditors may apply to the Court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purpose of enforcement of debt.</p><p>Attachment of earnings would arise where a Court orders the debtor&rsquo;s employer to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s earnings to pay over to the creditor. Deduction from social welfare payments would arise where the Court orders the Department of Social Protection to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s Social Welfare payments to pay over to the creditor.  However, these provisions would be subject to a number of safeguards for debtors such as:-</p><p>- The provisions may only be used by a creditor after reasonable efforts to engage with the debtor have failed.  In applying to court for an attachment or deduction order, as the case may be, the onus is on the creditor to demonstrate to the court the efforts he or she has made to seek repayment.</p><p>- The debtor will be offered an opportunity to make representations to the court on his or her behalf before the court may make a decision on the matter.</p><p>- Importantly, in making a decision, the Court will be required to take into account the debtor&rsquo;s capacity to repay the debt in terms of the amount of the attachment or deduction which would be ordered.</p><p>- Provision is also made for variation or termination of the order if the debtor&rsquo;s circumstances change materially.</p><p>Of course the Government recognises that civil debts arise as a result of a range of different causes whether from financial borrowings or the supply of goods and services, including what might be regarded as essential services. The Government's intention is that this new legislation would not provide &quot;carte blanche&quot; as regards the use of the proposed attachment and deduction provisions in respect of all debts regardless of their source and amount. Methods of delimiting the application of the new measures having regard to both size of debt and the nature or source of the debt are being worked on actively, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, as part of the drafting process.</p><p>Importantly, the proposed Bill will also make provision for the abolition of imprisonment of debtors except in the case of maintenance arising from family law proceedings.  This implements one of the key recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this area.  Under existing law, arrest and imprisonment remains a possibility as an enforcement mechanism of last resort in cases where a creditor has proved beyond all reasonable doubt the judgment debtor has failed to comply with an instalment order due to his or her wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  This Bill removes this possibility for the vast majority of debtors.</p><p>Without doubt, the most desirable situation is for creditors and debtors to reach an amicable agreement for settlement of the debt.  However, the reality is that in some cases the debtor &ndash; who may actually be in a position to pay the debt -  simply refuses to engage with the creditor or does not adhere to the agreed repayment schedule to satisfy an outstanding debt.  It is an economic reality that creditors must have a  range of options available to them to recover money owed to them particularly where the debtor has capacity to repay and will not do so.</p></reply>

In addition, the proposed Bill will provide for the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee, the membership of which will include lay persons, to facilitate the investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct.</p><p>My Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to bring the Bill to a timely conclusion.  My objective is to secure Government approval for the publication of the Bill during the current D&aacute;il session and, I remain committed to that objective.</p><p>In relation to the establishment of a Sentencing Council, I would note that judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  This position has been acknowledged by the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy which took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and not does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.</p><p>In my view, given the scope of and the intent underlying the Judicial Council Bill, it is not the appropriate vehicle within which to provide for a Sentencing Council.  There are currently no plans to make provision in that Bill for the establishment of such a Council.  However, this matter will be kept under review.</p></reply>

Members must retire on compulsory age grounds on reaching the age of 60.</p><p>It is difficult to establish an average figure for Garda retirements, particularly as the annual rate of retirements has been affected in the past by one-off factors such as the grace period which lasted until the end of February 2012.  While it would not be unreasonable, therefore, extrapolating from recent experience, to expect that retirements might range somewhere between 300 and 400, it is not possible to give a scientific estimate.</p><p><b>Garda Retirements 2010 - 2014</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th><div>Com</div></th><th><div>D/Com</div></th><th><div>A/Com</div></th><th><div>C/Supt</div></th><th><div>Supt</div></th><th><div>Insp</div></th><th><div>Sgt</div></th><th><div>Gda</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>97</div></td><td><div>254</div></td><td><div>379</div></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>22</div></td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>106</div></td><td><div>286</div></td><td><div>444</div></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>116</div></td><td><div>264</div></td><td><div>429</div></td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>91</div></td><td><div>211</div></td><td><div>335</div></td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>83</div></td><td><div>179</div></td><td><div>290</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Most recently, on foot of a submission from the Innocence Project Ireland and the Justice for Harry Gleeson Group, the Attorney General directed that the case be reviewed by Mr. Shane Murphy SC.  Mr. Murphy concluded that, in his opinion, there were deficiencies in the conviction such as to render it unsafe. The Attorney concurred with this assessment, and advised that the deficiencies were such as to warrant the Government recommending to the President that he exercise his right of pardon.</p>  <p>  Mr Murphy detailed a number of factors which led to him forming his opinion, including the failure by the prosecution to introduce particular evidence, and these are set out in detail in the statement which I issued.</p>  <p>  It is important that I clarify that the examination carried out by Mr. Murphy was not intended to be an inquiry designed to establish all of the facts surrounding the conviction of Mr.Gleeson or indeed the murder of Ms. McCarthy.  The intention in carrying out the examination was focused on determining whether a case had been made for a pardon.  Accordingly, coming to a determination in relation to the motivation of any of the persons involved in the prosecution or investigation was not within the scope of the process, nor would such an exercise be warranted or feasible at this considerable remove.</p>  <p>  As I stated when I announced the Government's decision in relation to the Presidential pardon, it is a matter of the very greatest regret that a man was convicted and executed in these circumstances.  In deciding to recommend Mr Gleeson's pardon the Government is exercising the only available remedy which is to clear his name in the hope that this provides some suitable tribute to his memory.  Equally the Government regrets that this leaves unresolved the murder of Ms McCarthy, which deprived her young family of their mother.  The Government has expressed its sympathy with both families and all affected by this crime and the subsequent conviction.</p></reply>

Furthermore, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act, 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service and I have no direct role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I understand, however, that the Deputy's interest specifically relates to the management of road traffic matters in the courts and related interactions between the agencies referred to.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in the first instance, road traffic legislation is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Insofar as current collaborative measures are concerned, the Deputy will be aware that Ireland has developed a multi-agency approach to road safety through the involvement of a number of agencies working in partnership.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service work in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority and other relevant partner agencies and institutions in the development and implementation of the actions and initiatives as set out in the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020.  I can assure the Deputy there is ongoing monitoring of actions and measurement of outcomes as part of this Strategy, including under the aegis of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Road Safety, which is chaired by my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of road traffic infringements are dealt with by means of the Fixed Charge Processing System and the Penalty Point System.  These arrangements have formed a key part in Ireland's Road Safety Strategy for several years and have gained widespread acceptance and contributed to enforcement and reduced serious injury and road fatalities.  They represent an efficient and user friendly means of dealing with road traffic infringements with a majority of fixed charges being paid without recourse to court.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that these are large and complex interdependent systems requiring continuous attention and development.  I can assure the Deputy that there is ongoing liaison between all of the stakeholders involved at an operational level with a view to addressing any issues that arise, and also in the development of road traffic legislation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group was established in March 2014 to take forward the Garda Inspectorate's recommendations on the operation of the FCPS.  The Group is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and the Road Safety Authority also participate in the Group along with the Revenue Commissioners, Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of the Environment Community and Local Government, and the Office of the Attorney General.  In addition to taking forward the recommendations of the Inspectorate, the Group also provides a further forum for communication and collaboration along the lines referred to by the Deputy and a number of the matters under examination relate to the exchange of information and data between the agencies in question.</p></reply>

As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, as the Act provides a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment. These changes will have significant implications for agencies across the Justice sector, including the Courts and the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service.</p>  <p>  The changes in processes and procedures which are required to implement the new system have to be carefully developed to ensure that the new system operates effectively and efficiently from the beginning.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act.  The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation and the new procedures which will operate under it are as efficient as possible.</p>  <p>  There are major changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.</p>  <p>  The introduction of payment by instalment will increase the overall workload of  processing fine payments. The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices. A procurement process is currently underway and contract negotiations with the preferred bidder are ongoing. The service provider will have to be in place before the new system can be fully implemented. The service provider's IT system will have to link in to the Courts Service IT system.</p>  <p>  Good progress in being made in the preparatory work. It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of this year. It is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.</p>  <p>  As I stated when publishing the Annual Report for 2014 of the Irish Prison Service on 18 May 2015, despite a small increase of 2.7% in the total committals to prison the overall daily average number of prisoners in custody has continued to fall. The overall daily average number of prisoners in custody in 2014 was 3,915 compared to 4,158 in 2013, a decrease of 5.8%.</p>  <p>  There were 16,155 committals to prison in 2014 compared to 15,735 in 2013. The increase is attributed to an 8% increase in the numbers committed on sentences of less than 3 months specifically those committed for the non-payment of a court ordered fine. I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that on 19 May 2015 six persons or (0.2%) of the prison population of 3,739 were in custody for non-payment of a court ordered fine.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Fines (Payments and Recovery) Act is to eliminate, in so far as possible, the option of imprisonment as a sanction for fine default. Once the significant changes required to the fines system are implemented, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prison on short sentences.</p></reply>

Cross border criminality is one of several issues which we discussed at our trilateral meeting in February which was also attended by the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Michael Matheson.  The issue will be discussed again at the forthcoming North South Ministerial Council plenary meeting to be held in Dublin on 5 June next.  A key element of our discussions is to review the ongoing cooperation between an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as well as that between appropriate justice agencies in both jurisdictions - for example, the Revenue Commissioners and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  Minister Ford and I are very pleased with the the cooperation that currently exists but we are always open to explore how the relationships may be further enhanced.</p>  <p>  The Garda&iacute; work closely with the PSNI and the UK National Crime Agency in combating the activities of organised crime gangs, with a particular focus on cross-border crime.  A key feature of the ongoing efforts to counteract cross-border crime is the inter-agency nature of the operational cooperation which involves the two police services and the two customs services on the island, and the Criminal Assets Bureau and the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency.  The two police services operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its objectives the  improvement of public safety throughout Ireland, the disruption of criminal activity and the enhancement of the policing capability of both police services on the island.  Both police services are jointly engaged in implementing a number of initiatives in all areas of policing in all these areas with a particular focus on areas close to the border.</p>  <p>  Law enforcement in relation to the smuggling of tobacco products, the sale of illicit or counterfeit tobacco products within the State and fuel smuggling/laundering is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  However, in targeting the illicit trade there is close cooperation between the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is also considerable cross border cooperation in tackling these illicit activities. The work of the Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling, which comprises representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue and Customs, the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau, has ensured that a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, operating in both jurisdictions, have been specifically targeted by the agencies involved.  A similar inter-agency group, the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group, is in place to support the fight against the activities of gangs engaged in tobacco smuggling.</p>  <p>  The success of this cooperation has been recognised by the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, who met to discuss the issue of cross border cooperation and illicit trade at their plenary session on 23 and 24 February last.  The Committee noted that cross border cooperation between justice and law enforcement officials and agencies is excellent and acknowledges those involved for their courage in tackling cross border crime and to make communities safer all across the island of Ireland.  I am currently considering the report and recommendations of the Committee and I will communicate my response to the Committee in the near future.</p>  <p>  I would also say that the Garda authorities are keenly aware of the links that exist between paramilitary groups and organised criminal gangs, and factor this into their strategic approaches to combating these serious activities.  There remains a real and persistent threat from &lsquo;dissident&rsquo; paramilitary groups on this island and the Garda&iacute; and their counterparts are active in counteracting and disrupting their activities.</p></reply>

Niall Molloy.  The report was published with a number of redactions which were made following consultation with the Attorney General and in agreement with Mr. McGinn.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge, as I did when publishing the report, that first and foremost this case involves the tragic death of a man much loved by his family and by those in the community.</p>  <p>  On foot of concerns raised by the family of Fr Molloy, the SCRT carried out a major review of the case which involved an extensive examination of the original investigation, as well as detailed inquiries into the additional issues raised.  The SCRT report was submitted to the DPP who advised that there be no further prosecution in the case.</p>  <p>  While I, as Minister, have no role in the prosecution process I am of course very aware of the claims which have been made about Father Molloy&rsquo;s death over many years.  In an effort to address concerns about this matter, it was decided to appoint Mr. McGinn to independently assess what information could be put into the public domain in relation to the SCRT review of the case, and to advise as to whether further inquiry would be warranted.  This was an exceptional course of action, motivated by the desire to bring the greatest possible transparency to bear.</p>  <p>  The thrust of Mr. McGinn's report has been to shed light on as many issues as possible in order to minimise the number of unanswered questions regarding the case.  The report outlines how some of the concerns expressed about this case are simply not supported by evidence.  It also details shortcomings in the original investigation, which were identified by the SCRT Review.</p>  <p>  While unanswered questions do remain, the report concludes that the precise events surrounding Father Molloy&rsquo;s death cannot now be ascertained.  It concludes that, given the passage of time, the death of many of the pertinent witnesses, and the reluctance of others to give evidence, that it is unlikely any further inquiry would have a reasonable prospect of establishing the truth.  In these circumstances I have accepted the report's recommendation that examination by a further inquiry would not be warranted, and accordingly have no plans to commission a review along the lines referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is not the outcome that Fr Molloy's family have sought but I believe it is the only reasonable conclusion that can be reached following Mr McGinn's careful analysis of the SCRT review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-26a.55.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600054#WRB00900"><p>By way of background, can I explain that, prior to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 coming into operation, whistleblowing by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was provided for under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, which provided for the appointment of an independent Confidential Recipient to whom Garda members, and civilian support staff, could report, in full confidence, instances where they believed there may have been corruption or malpractice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Confidential Recipient was required to transmit each confidential report to the Garda Commissioner.  Only where a confidential report contained an allegation which related to the Garda Commissioner was it transmitted to the Minister.  In transmitting a report, the Confidential Recipient was obliged to protect the identity of the whistleblower, and any communication between the Confidential Recipient and the whistleblower was confidential and was not conveyed to the Minister or Departmental officials.  The Regulations provided that any harassment or intimidation of a member who had made a confidential report would be dealt with in accordance with law and the relevant disciplinary regulations or disciplinary code.</p>  <p>  This system was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014 as part of this Government's comprehensive approach to enhance the protection available to whistle blowers, including Garda whistleblowers.  GSOC was prescribed under the Act as a body to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may now communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer, or to GSOC as a prescribed body, and are entitled to the protections provided by the Act.  I am satisfied that the legislative provisions now in place under the 2014 Act, including the protections afforded for whistleblowers, will prove to be an effective remedy for Garda members who wish to report their concerns regarding potential wrongdoing.</p>  <p>  With regard to the two cases referred to by the Deputy, can I first of all make the point that all of us in this House must be very careful in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  The Protected Disclosures Act rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the whistleblowing process, a confidentiality which is not easily reconciled with open discussions on the floor of this House.  However, I can say that I am advised by the Garda authorities that reports in both of the cases referred to by the Deputy were originally received under the Confidential Recipient regulations.  I understand that one of the cases is the subject of a comprehensive criminal investigation and upon completion may be the subject of a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I understand that the second case was subsequently referred to GSOC under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.</p>  <p>  I know that the Deputy will appreciate that I have no functions in relation to criminal investigations and the submission of files to the DPP, or in relation to the investigation of complaints by GSOC, and we must await the outcome of these investigations.</p></reply>

The first is resettlement of refugees identified by the UNHCR  and the second relates to relocation within the EU of persons in need of protection.  Both of these are featured in the European Agenda on Migration published last week by the EU Commission and there has been no meeting of Justice and Home Affairs since that date.  It can be anticipated that both will be on the agenda for the JHA Council in June. The matter has been mentioned  at previous councils but in the absence of concrete proposals the discussions have been general in nature.</p>  <p>  For a more detailed outline of the general position in relation to the situation in the Mediterranean I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No 20217/15  answered today.</p></reply>

It will be important to learn from international experience, and I have asked my Department to evaluate how the Community Court model will work in the Irish context, drawing from best practice, with a view to setting up a Community Court on a pilot basis in the Dublin city centre area.  I envisage an initial project where stakeholders, such as Dublin City Business Association among others will engage in partnership, in the planning phase to develop a suitable model of a Community Court.</p>  <p>  It was not possible to progress the initiative during 2014 due to the need to dedicate resources to other priority projects including the establishment of the new Court of Appeal and also to progress other ongoing projects, such as the judicial appointments review and the reform of the family law courts. However, I can assure the Deputy that the matter is currently under active consideration in my Department and it is my intention that the proposal will be further progressed in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Community Court is a problem-solving court and the model operates in different ways in different jurisdictions. Work commenced on setting parameters for a pilot last week with a meeting brokered by my Department among the key Justice sector stakeholders. This meeting confirmed that a considerable amount of preparatory work will need to be undertaken in collaboration with all stakeholders - both within the Justice sector and the wider community of agencies and groups whose active participation and buy in will be necessary -  before the pilot project can be established successfully. Proper planning is essential and a needs assessment will first be undertaken to guide the identification of the goals and priority objectives of the pilot Community Court. It is also essential that the proposal is fully evaluated to ensure that it delivers the required results. Each of the stakeholders involved is operating with limited resources so the preparation and planning stages of the project are essential to ensure that the resources involved are used effectively. It is also important that the project would operate in a fully integrated way.  The Justice sector  group which met last week has identified a number of steps to be taken pending a further meeting to be held in June and my Department will be actively progressing consideration of the Community Court proposal in the coming months.</p></reply>

Cross border criminality is one of several issues which we discussed at our trilateral meeting in February which was also attended by the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Michael Matheson.  The issue will be discussed again at the forthcoming North South Ministerial Council plenary meeting to be held in Dublin on 5 June next.  A key element of our discussions is to review the ongoing cooperation between an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as well as that between appropriate  justice agencies in both jurisdictions - for example, the Revenue Commissioners and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  Minister Ford and I are very pleased with the the cooperation that currently exists but we are always open to explore how the relationships may be further enhanced.</p>  <p>  The Garda&iacute; work closely with the PSNI and the UK National Crime Agency in combating the activities of organised crime gangs, with a particular focus on cross-border crime.  A key feature of the ongoing efforts to counteract cross-border crime is the inter-agency nature of the operational cooperation which involves the two police services and the two customs services on the island, and the Criminal Assets Bureau and the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency.  The two police services operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its objectives the  improvement of public safety throughout Ireland, the disruption of criminal activity and the enhancement of the policing capability of both police services on the island.  Both police services are jointly engaged in implementing a number of initiatives in all areas of policing in all these areas with a particular focus on areas close to the border.</p>  <p>  Law enforcement in relation to the smuggling of tobacco products, the sale of illicit or counterfeit tobacco products within the State and fuel smuggling/laundering is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  However, in targeting the illicit trade there is close cooperation between the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is also considerable cross border cooperation in tackling these illicit activities. The work of the Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling, which comprises representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue and Customs, the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau, has ensured that a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, operating in both jurisdictions, have been specifically targeted by the agencies involved.  A similar inter-agency group, the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group, is in place to support the fight against the activities of gangs engaged in tobacco smuggling.</p>  <p>  The success of this cooperation has been recognised by the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, who met to discuss the issue of cross border cooperation and illicit trade at their plenary session on 23 and 24 February last.  The Committee noted that cross border cooperation between justice and law enforcement officials and agencies is excellent and acknowledges those involved for their courage in tackling cross border crime and to make communities safer all across the island of Ireland.

Section 19 of the Act inserted a new provision into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) to be a prescribed body under the 2014 Act to investigate disclosures relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including disclosures from members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As a consequence, they are also entitled to the protections provided by the Act.  I am satisfied that the legislative provisions now in place, including the protections afforded for whistleblowers, will prove to be an effective remedy for members who wish to report their concerns regarding potential wrongdoing.</p><p>It is worth emphasising that GSOC is an independent statutory body. It has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.

The people who carried it out displayed nothing but contempt for life itself and inflicted unutterable grief on those whose lives were shattered by the bomb.</p>  <p>  While considerable efforts were made, North and South, to bring those responsible to justice, it is a matter of great regret that the perpetrators of the bombing have not been brought to justice in relation to it.  However, I would say that the Garda investigations remain open and the Garda&iacute; stand ready to pursue fully any new or additional evidence that might come to light.</p>  <p>  My predecessor met with members of the Omagh Support and Self-Help Group in July 2012, where they raised issues of concern with regard to events surrounding the bombing and presented a copy of a document setting out these concerns in support of its call for a public inquiry.  A detailed consideration of the matters raised, insofar as they relate to this State and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, had been carried out and was being finalised.  Given the detailed and sensitive nature of the material in the document it required some time for those matters to be given proper consideration.</p>  <p>  However, in April 2014 a man was arrested in Northern Ireland and has been charged with the 29 murders caused by the bomb at Omagh.  In these circumstances, it was considered appropriate and the safest course of action to postpone finalising consideration of the matters raised by the Omagh Group until the completion of the prosecution process in Northern Ireland.  This position has been communicated directly to the Omagh Group.</p>  <p>  In our shared desire for those who carried out the atrocity at Omagh to face justice I believe we must all seek to ensure we do not do or say anything that could in any way be interpreted to interfere with that process.  I fully understand that the Group wishes to receive a response to its concerns and I am anxious to ensure that will take place as soon as is prudent.</p></reply>

The top five nationalities were Nigeria, China , DR Congo, Mauritius and Malawi. In all cases, the minors were accompanied in the State by a parent or parents, in respect of whom Deportation Orders were also signed. The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department does not issue Deportation Orders to unaccompanied minors.</p>  <p>  In enforcing the law in respect of deportations, Ireland is no different to other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory. Ireland, like other EU member states, uses deportation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as the policy of last resort. The process leading to a deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders. It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.</p>  <p>  In order to provide a more complete picture of the situation regarding the signing of orders for non-Irish nationals minors during the period in question, it should be noted that during the same period there were no Removal Orders signed in respect of EU National minors and that 2 Transfer Orders were signed in respect of minors under the Dublin Regulation.</p>  <p>  Minors are not refused leave to land in the State at ports of entry. However, the parents of accompanied minors can be refused leave to land and the accompanied minors are returned with their parents to the country they arrived from.

It will be important to learn from international experience, and I have asked my Department to evaluate how the Community Court model will work in the Irish context, drawing from best practice, with a view to setting up a Community Court on a pilot basis in the Dublin city centre area.  I envisage an initial project where stakeholders will engage in partnership, in conjunction with the local business community.</p><p>It was not possible to progress the initiative during 2014 due to the need to dedicate resources to other priority projects including the establishment of the new Court of Appeal and also to progress other ongoing projects, such as the judicial appointments review and the reform of the family law courts.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the matter is currently under active consideration in my Department and it is my intention that the proposal will be further progressed in the coming months.</p><p>The Community Court is a problem-solving court and the model operates in different ways in different jurisdictions.  The research and analysis in the National Crime Council's report will be of benefit in our further consideration of establishing a pilot Community Court.  Work commenced on setting parameters for a pilot last week with a meeting brokered by my Department among the key Justice sector stakeholders.  This meeting confirmed that a considerable amount of preparatory work will need to be undertaken in collaboration with all stakeholders - both within the Justice sector and the wider community of agencies and groups whose active participation and buy in will be necessary -  before the pilot project can be established successfully.  Proper planning is essential and a needs assessment will first be undertaken to guide the identification of the goals and priority objectives of the pilot Community Court.  It is also essential that the proposal is fully evaluated to ensure that it delivers the required results.  Each of the stakeholders involved is operating with limited resources so the preparation and planning stages of the project are essential to ensure that the resources involved are used effectively.  It is also important that the project would operate in a fully integrated way.  The Justice sector group which met last week has identified a number of steps to be taken pending a further meeting to be held in June and my Department will be actively progressing consideration of the Community Court proposal in the coming months.</p></reply>

Nevertheless counsel are making every effort to conclude their work as soon as is reasonably practicable.</p>  <p>  The review of each complaint consists of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the Panel.  Following the review of each complaint a recommendation will be made as to whether any further action is desirable and could practicably be taken.</p>  <p>  Although counsel have not yet completed their work, my Department has received a number of recommendations.  The first batch of draft submissions and letters of notification of the outcome of the review have been submitted to me for consideration.  I believe that it would be in the best interests of all concerned that an independent element should now be brought into this part of the process.  I have decided to appoint a former judicial figure to oversee the preparation of these summaries.  That person appointed will be able to independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them are a fair reflection of the advice which has been made available to the Department.</p>  <p>  The House will appreciate that the IRM was an unprecedented process which went far beyond anything which any previous Government has done to address the type of issues which had arisen.  I hope the House can accept that what I have decided about communicating decisions is the right course of action to take.</p></reply>

In doing so, officials in INIS maintain regular close contact with relevant Government Departments and agencies.  It is, however, important to emphasise, at the outset, that the vast majority of tourists visiting the State - over 96% - are from countries whose citizens do not require a visa to travel to the State e.g. the United Kingdom, other EU states, the United States, etc.</p>  <p>  In July, 2011, the Government launched the first ever Irish Short-Stay Visa Waiver Programme.  Under this Programme, tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa are able to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  The Programme covers eighteen countries including major emerging tourism and business markets such as China and India.  The Programme has proven extremely successful leading to a 68% increase in visits from the countries covered by it from 2010 (the last full year before its introduction) and 2013.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of this programme, negotiations took place with the United Kingdom authorities on the development of a reciprocal programme i.e. of also allowing visitors with an Irish visa to travel to the UK on the basis of that visa.  These negotiations led to the establishment of the British Irish Visa Scheme which I launched, with the UK Home Secretary, in October last year.  This Scheme was implemented in China later that month and in India in February of this year.  The Scheme, which will supersede the Waiver Programme, allows visitors to travel to and around the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, including the north and south of the island of Ireland, on a single visa.  A formal joint review of the Scheme with the UK is due to be carried out shortly and both Governments have committed to the worldwide rollout of the Scheme to be substantially completed by the end of this year.  I am confident that this Scheme will build on and expand the growth in visitor numbers resulting from the original Waiver Programme.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, a liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other regular visitors with a good visa history, has been implemented in the Irish Visa Offices in Beijing, Moscow, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi over the last few years.  This regime allows for the issue of multi-entry visas for up to five years' duration for applicants with a good previous visa history.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing visa regime continues to support and facilitate tourism growth from countries whose citizens are visa-required for travel to the State.</p></reply>

However, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to my proposal, approved by Government on 6 May 2015, for the drafting of the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill which will provide for the introduction of additional measures for the enforcement of civil debt.</p><p>The proposed Bill will implement a number of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) in relation to the enforcement of debt.  The<b><i></i></b>LRC Report published in 2010 on <i>Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement</i>made a number of recommendations for wide scale reform of the existing personal insolvency and debt enforcement regimes.  Key elements of that Report were implemented through enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.</p><p>The new Bill seeks to implement further recommendations of the Report aimed at enforcement and recovery of debts which could be developed to streamline the existing enforcement procedures.  Under the proposed Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill, creditors may apply to the court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purpose of enforcement of debts to which the legislation will apply.  Attachment of earnings would arise where a court orders the debtor&rsquo;s employer to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s earnings to pay over to the creditor.  Deduction from social welfare payments would arise where the court orders the Department of Social Protection to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s social welfare payments to pay over to the creditor.  However, these provisions will be subject to a number of safeguards for debtors and will have regard to the debtor's capacity to repay the amount owed.</p><p>Importantly, the Bill will also make provision to provide for the abolition of imprisonment of debtors except in the case of maintenance arising from family law proceedings.  This implements one of the key recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this area.  Under existing law, arrest and imprisonment remains a possibility as an enforcement mechanism of last resort in cases where a creditor has proved beyond all reasonable doubt the judgment debtor has failed to comply with an instalment order due to his or her wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  The proposed Bill removes this possibility for the vast majority of debtors.</p></reply>

My Department through the work of the Irish Youth Justice Service has committed to strengthening the evidence to support policies and services and to further develop targeted interventions to divert young people from the criminal justice system.  The set of actions by which we intend to do so, is detailed in Tackling Youth Crime, a Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018; which also forms part of &lsquo;Brighter Options, Better Futures&rsquo; the National Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020&rsquo;.  The focus is to continue the downward trends in high volume crime and reduce the necessity for detention through proven and innovative approaches to youth diversion.</p>  <p>  My Department has secured &euro;2.8 million under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan for Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are funded by the Community Programme Unit (CPU) of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS).  I was pleased to announce on 15 May last, the details of the first tranche of that funding, totalling &euro;1.37 million, which has been allocated for expenditure.  I have given my approval for 10 new GYDPs to open in areas which have not previously been served by a GYDP.  This will increase the total number of GYDPs in operation to 110.  In addition, the funding will be used to support the recruitment of additional staff to 16 existing Garda Youth Diversion Projects, in order to respond to higher levels of youth crime or to expand the geographical remit of the project.  Funding will also be provided for the expansion of an initiative in the Mid West area to engage with &ldquo;hard to reach&rdquo; young people involved in criminal activity.  The locations for the new GYDPs and additional staff in existing projects is available on both the Department of Justice and Equality and IYJS' websites.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased to have launched last week the first Divisional model of Garda Youth Diversion Project provision. Kerry Empowering Youth &ndash; KEY, a Kerry Garda Youth Justice Divisional Model is a new model of Garda Youth Diversion project delivery developed in partnership by Kerry Diocesan Youth Service (KDYS) and Kerry Garda Division, with support from the IYJS of my Department.  The new service delivery model has been very successful and has enabled KDYS in partnership with Kerry Divisional Garda&iacute; to reach over 100 additional young people so far who would not have otherwise received support from trained Youth Justice Workers.  The IYJS is currently rolling out an expansion of the Divisional Youth Diversion model in partnership with Garda&iacute; and Community Based Organisations in Cork City.</p>  <p>  From the start of this year, GYDPs and some Young Persons Probation (YPP) are being co-funded under the Programme for Employment, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) of the European Social Fund 2014-2020.  It is planned that a total of &euro;84 million will be expended over the course of the Programme.</p>  <p>  While there is no specific research linking the drop in youth crime to diversion projects, all stakeholders in the area, both statutory and non-statutory are extremely positive about their impact and success.  The Garda Youth Diversion Programme has made significant inroads in targeting supports to young people to effectively divert them towards more positive life choices.  I will shortly be publishing the 2013 Annual Report of the Committee to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Garda Diversion Programme which will show that the trend of falling numbers of young people coming to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and being referred to the Garda Diversion Programme is continuing.</p></reply>

The census will give a comprehensive picture of the social and living conditions of the country - information that only a census can provide in such complete geographical and fine grained detail. Similar to Census 2011 there will be detailed demographic results covering topics such as age profiles, employment, housing, families, migration, ethnicity, religion, health, education and commuting patterns.  Census Enumerators will call at every doorstep of every home in Ireland to deliver in the region of 1.8 million census forms.</p>  <p>  Given the recent budgetary environment that Ireland has experienced the Central Statistics Office conducted an extensive user consultation on the continuing need for a five-yearly census in Ireland.  The response to that consultation showed overwhelming support for a five-yearly census and the enormous value that the data brings, with particular emphasis on the value of small area data that only the census can provide.  The Government accordingly decided that a census will be undertaken in 2016.  Census day will be 24 April 2016.</p>  <p>  The expected cost of the 2016 Census is &euro;50 million, spread over the 3 years of  2015-2017; the field staff pay is the largest component at some &euro;26 million.</p>  <p>  The CSO will recruit over 5,180 temporary staff to conduct the field operation, made up of 50 senior managers, 430 field supervisors and some 4,700 enumerators.  The recruitment campaign began on 30 April with the advertisement of the 50 senior manager positions; interviews for these positions will take place in June and the first of these staff are due to take up duty on 28 September.  The recruitment of the 430 field supervisors, who will be employed for 6 months on the census, will begin in mid-September and they are due to be appointed in early January 2016.  Finally, the enumerators positions will be advertised at the end of December and they will be appointed for a 10 week period from mid-March until the end of May 2016.  Applications for all positions on the census are being accepted through an on-line application form on the CSO web site and are being advertised in advance through Intreo, on Publicjobs.ie and in the national press.</p>  <p>  The CSO works hard to ensure that the information collected and provided from the census remains current, relevant and of maximum use to the public.  It has been common practice in advance of each census to conduct a public consultation on possible new questions and changes to existing questions, which are then considered by a specially convened Census Advisory Group in advance of testing in the field in the form of a pilot survey of some 12,000 dwellings.  Unfortunately given the very tight budget circumstances in 2013 and 2014, with constraints on resources right across the public sector, it was not possible to pursue this route for census 2016.  Accordingly the 2016 census will be run as a &lsquo;no-change&rsquo; census with the questions on the 2016 questionnaire remaining unchanged from those used in the 2011 census, with the exception of the question on marital status.</p>  <p>  The format of the question on disability used in 2011, and being repeated in 2016, was agreed by the Census Advisory Group which was established to assist the CSO in developing the 2011 questionnaire.  This group comprised representatives of central and local government, the social partners, universities, research bodies and other users of census data, along with the relevant CSO personnel.  The group reviewed over 90 submissions for new questions or changes to existing questions during the course of their work.  In addition a specific sub-group, comprised of representatives from the National Disability Authority, the  Equality Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies was convened to consider the disability-related questions on the census form.  The current format of the disability question was tested successfully in the April 2009 Census Pilot Survey and the Government subsequently accepted the advice of the CSO and the Census Advisory Group to accept this format of the question.</p>  <p>  The exact format of the question is outlined below, and persons can choose multiple categories of disabilities.  As censuses of population are traditionally held at five-yearly intervals in Ireland it is intended that should there be a census in 2021 a full public consultation on the questions to be asked will be conducted in advance.</p>  <p>Q. 16.

The trustees are required to report the funding position of a scheme to the Pensions Authority on a regular basis.  If a scheme fails to meet the funding requirement, the trustees are required to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Authority setting out how it is proposed to restore scheme funding.</p>  <p>  This funding requirement was suspended following the downturn in financial markets in 2008.  In the meantime, a number of both administrative and legislative measures were introduced to support employers and trustees of pension schemes in responding to the funding challenge.  Following a review of the defined benefit pension model, I introduced legislation in 2012 which required the trustees of pension schemes to maintain an additional level of funding in the form of a &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; to protect the pension entitlements of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  Pension schemes are required to have this level of funding in place by 2023.  Following this change to legislation in 2012, the funding requirements set out in the Pension Act were re-introduced.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is working with the trustees of pension schemes to achieve sustainable pension provision.  At the end of 2014, 60% of defined benefit pension schemes were in compliance with the funding requirements set out in the Pensions Act.  All except for 30 schemes of the remainder have agreed funding proposals.  The Pensions Authority is in intensive dialogue with the trustees of these outstanding scheme.</p></reply>

The cost of pensions in payment can be determined by reference to the cost of an equivalent annuity or annuities.  The value of deferred pension entitlements is taken as the individual transfer values to which each member would be entitled on the date he or she transferred out of a scheme.</p>  <p>  The trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme are required to maintain sufficient assets in a pension scheme in order to meet the liabilities of the scheme in the event of a wind-up of the scheme.  This requirement is often referred as the Funding Standard.  For the purposes of the Funding Standard, assets must be valued at their realisable value.</p>  <p>  A scheme actuary who is valuing the assets and liabilities of a pension scheme for the purposes of determining whether it complies with the Funding Standard must comply with Actuarial Statements of Practice issued by the Society of Actuaries in Ireland and with Statutory Guidance issued by the Pensions Authority.  These statements of practice and statutory guidance which reference the life tables are updated periodically and are subject to the approval of the Minister for Social Protection.  Work in this regard, therefore,  involves the Society of Actuaries in Ireland, the Pensions Authority and the Department.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2015, representing approx. 34.4% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  The Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;168 million this year for the increasing number of pensioners.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approx. &euro;237 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 415,000 customers.  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s clients and particularly those who are living alone.  In Budget 2015, I was able to increase the rate of the living alone allowance to &euro;9.00 per week.  The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments &ndash; Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance &ndash; that are conditional on the recipient being actively seeking and available for employment, as well as, in the case of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, meeting a means test. The employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.</p>  <p>  Many services are available to the unemployed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.

The rates of carers allowance and carers benefit are among the higher rates of social welfare payments. The weekly payment rate for a person aged under 66, caring for 1 person is &euro;204, while the rate for a person aged over 66 is &euro;239.  An increase of 50% is paid where a carer is caring for more than one person (&euro;306 and &euro;358.50 for carers under and over 66 respectively).</p>  <p>  Total expenditure on carers (Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Respite Care Grant) has increased from just under &euro;752 million in 2010 to almost &euro;806 million in 2014. This is an increase of &euro;53.9 million or 7.2%.</p>  <p>  In addition to the provision of income support, the Department made a commitment in the NCS to organise an annual meeting where organisations representing carers would be afforded an opportunity to meet officials from the relevant Departments with responsibilities in this area and the HSE to discuss issues of concern. The most recent of these meetings was in February last, and the feedback from the carers&rsquo; organisations to this development is very positive. In addition to that annual meeting, I am pleased to say that the Department also meets regularly with the carers&rsquo; representative groups to discuss both policy and operational issues. Carers&rsquo; groups are also represented at the Department&rsquo;s annual pre-Budget forum. </p>  <p>  In relation to the rate of respite care grant, I am aware that the reduction in the rate of the grant in 2013 was challenging for carers but in framing budgetary adjustments, the concern has been to protect primary social welfare rates, as indicated above, and any change to the rate of the grant can only be considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position.</p>  <p>  However, I would point out that the rate of &euro;1,375 is still more than twice what it was in 2002 (when it was &euro;635), and higher than it was in 2006 at the height of the economic boom, (when it was &euro;1,200).</p></reply>

The Request for Tender (RFT) document was published on the government&rsquo;s e-tenders website and the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) website.  </p><p>The Department is engaged in a programme to modernise its services. This modernisation programme is fundamental to the Department&rsquo;s objectives of delivering a comprehensive service to people and positioning the Department to better adapt to political priorities and changing customer needs. </p><p>The Department has established a new Employment and Support Service (Intreo), as provided for in the Programme for Government.  The objective of the Intreo service is to integrate the provision of employment services and benefit payment services so as to ensure that the payment of income supports to jobseekers is directly linked to the equally, if not more important, task of supporting them in their pursuit of employment and related opportunities and improving their life chances. The provision of a new online Public Employment Jobs Matching/Vacancy service is central to that effort.  </p><p>Tenderers are asked to outline their approach to providing a system as a service that meets the requirements set out in the RFT, namely, to provide a solution that will: </p><p>- Provide a new on-line Public Employment Vacancy/Jobs Matching Service;</p><p>- Deliver an improved online Vacancy advertising and matching service; </p><p>- Populate the EURES Public Employment Portal with validated Irish Vacancies;</p><p>- Allow DSP staff and Employers to manage DSP Employment Programmes;</p><p>- Automatically validate Vacancies where possible;</p><p>- Aggregate Vacancies from other selected websites for display on the JobsIreland website;</p><p>- Allow unregistered Jobfinders to search for vacancies; </p><p>- Allow Jobfinders to create an account;</p><p>- Allow registered Jobfinders to manage multiple CVs from their profiles;</p><p>- Automatically match Jobfinders to Vacancies and vice-versa;</p><p>- Allow Employers to search registered Jobfinder profiles;</p><p>- Allow Jobfinders to apply for Vacancies via the system;</p><p>- Allow DSP to create a link between a Jobseeker and their registered (JobsIreland) Jobfinder account;</p><p>- Allow DSP to search Jobfinder accounts in JobsIreland where the Jobfinder is a Jobseeker; </p><p>- Provide a EURES Ireland feature with relevant links to EURES service;</p><p>- Permit DSP staff to monitor a Jobseeker&rsquo;s activity via the Department&rsquo;s Activation Case Management system;</p><p>- Support the Department by eliminating paper based business processes and reducing telephone queries.</p><p>The solution proposed should also enable employers, inter alia, to:</p><p>- Register to use the service; </p><p>- Create Vacancies, including the specification of key role requirements and competencies in a manner that can be easily matched with Jobfinders Jobseeker profiles; </p><p>- Display salaried Vacancies on the EURES website; </p><p>- Be notified of Jobfinders who are matched to a Vacancy by the JobsIreland system and view the details of their profiles; </p><p>- Communicate with Jobfinders or DSP staff/Administrators; amd</p><p>- Invite, receive, view and download detailed applications for Vacancies from Jobfinders</p></reply>

The Department will be writing to registered customers in late August and September to advise them of the application process. In order to minimise costs payment will be by electronic funds transfer.  In exceptional cases a cheque may be issued. </p>  <p>  A total of fifteen staff are being assigned initially to administer the scheme.  In addition, staff from a variety of disciplines within the Department are inputting to the project as required.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the grant will operate over a number of years, and at least until the end of 2018 in keeping with the package of measures announced by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government on 19 November 2014.  The administration and payment of this grant is a significant project for the Department and requires the development and implementation of ICT systems, ICT infrastructure and various customer support and communications services.  It requires a number of public procurement exercises, one of which is underway at present.  Accordingly, the start-up costs to develop and set up the ICT solutions, and put in place comprehensive customer support services, will be incurred in 2015.  On the basis of the scoping work done to date, it is now estimated that these once-off costs, together with the operational costs for 2015, will amount in total to approx. &euro;6 million.  As expenditure in forthcoming years will be limited to operational costs, it should be considerably less, resulting in overall administrative costs being within 2-3% of scheme costs over its lifetime.  </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to maximise efficiencies and keep costs to the absolute minimum.  In this regard, the Department will be reusing existing payment production systems to facilitate payment of the grant.  It is also intended that the ICT infrastructure put in place for this project will be reused for the provision of online services in the future.</p></reply>

In some cases, progression to a new course will be considered as part of this arrangement and, as such, customers should discuss their options with their local Intreo Centre/Social Welfare Office.</p>  <p>  Customers who are also in receipt of the SUSI grant from the Department of Education and Skills (D/ES) can retain both their OFP payment and their grant, including the maintenance portion of it, until their course finishes &ndash; subject to the normal D/ES conditions for the grant. The maintenance grant will continue to be disregarded for means on the OFP payment.</p>  <p>  All customers who are scheduled to transition out of the OFP scheme from 3 July, 2015, onwards, will have a youngest child who has just turned 7 years of age.  For that reason, any of these customers who are mid-course will be moved to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment. They will then have seven years to complete their course before moving to the JA scheme, where the normal JA scheme rules in relation to participation on full time education courses will apply.  In addition, any SUSI grant recipients who are in receipt of the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment are able to receive the full benefit of the grant as it is disregarded for means purposes under the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.</p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to raise the educational and skill levels to enable jobseekers better access to the emerging needs of the labour market in line with Government activation strategy.  A number of changes have been introduced to the operation of the BTEA in recent years to implement the recommendations of the Review of Employment Support Schemes published by the Department in January 2013.</p>  <p>  A person who receives statutory redundancy may be granted immediate access to the BTEA, provided they are able to establish an entitlement to a qualifying payment. In general, the value of the BTEA weekly payment is equivalent to the weekly rate on the underlying qualifying payment.  A person who receives voluntary redundancy does not have the same entitlement.</p>  <p>  A jobseeker who qualified for BTEA based on a jobseekers benefit (JB) payment will receive BTEA for the duration of the JB entitlement only.  This change was introduced in 2014 and became operable for all applications received after 1 January 2015.  The BTEA payment will only continue in circumstances where an entitlement to one of the other qualifying payments for BTEA can be established.  In the case of JB, this will most likely be a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment.</p></reply>

This included a reference to the distributional consequences of monetary policy by penalising savers to the benefit of debtors and through asset price increases which may disproportionately favour the wealthy and increase inequality.</p><p>Let me firstly point out that Mr Draghi also highlighted the distributional effects from monetary policy inaction as well as action.</p><p>The Expanded Asset Purchase Programme (EAPP), launched on 9 March 2015, is aimed at fulfilling the ECB's price stability mandate. Asset purchases provide monetary stimulus to the economy in a context where key ECB interest rates are effectively at the lower bound. They should further ease monetary and financial conditions. They should also help to support investment and consumption, and ultimately contribute to a return of inflation rates which are close to 2 per cent.</p><p>Ireland should benefit from quantitative easing in a number of ways:</p><p>- Through improved financing conditions for households and firms; </p><p>- By raising demand in the euro area, Ireland's single largest export destination; </p><p>- Through the depreciation of the currency which improves the competitiveness of Irish exports outside the euro area;</p><p>- Through the restoration of price stability which will help reduce the real debt burden. </p><p>While quantitative easing will likely be beneficial for the Irish economy, there is nevertheless the possibility of side effects such as increased asset prices which will benefit the holder of the assets. </p><p>In this regard, I would point out that Capital Gains Tax applies on any chargeable gain from the disposal of many assets, including non-principal private residences and to equity gains. Stamp Duty also applies to the purchase of assets such as property and shares. Therefore, in the event of increases in asset values, there would be a proportionate increase in the tax paid. </p><p>Finally, I would point out that all tax rates and regimes are held under continuous review by my Department and that any changes are made in the context of the annual budgetary cycle, including the Finance Bill.</p></reply>

This Levy came into effect in December 2014 with just under &euro;1.4 million collected to date.  </p><p><b>Credit Institutions Resolution Fund</b></p><p>The Credit Institutions Resolution Fund - Resolution Fund, was established by section 10(1) of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 (as amended) - 2011 Act. Under section 10(2) of the 2011 Act, the Resolution Fund is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution. This definition includes a credit union. </p><p>To date, the resources of the Resolution Fund have been utilised to fund the resolution of four credit unions. In the case of three of those credit unions, the resolution action taken was a directed transfer under the 2011 Act, and the Resolution Fund funded a financial incentive for the transferee. The remaining case was a liquidation, and no financial incentive was paid from the Resolution Fund in respect of that action. In each of the four cases, the Central Bank discharged its third party resolution-related costs against the Resolution Fund.</p><p>The amounts paid or payable to date from the Resolution Fund for incentives in each of the three transfer resolution cases are as follows:</p><p>Newbridge Credit Union Limited: &euro;27 million</p><p>Howth Sutton Credit Union Limited: &euro;2.15 million</p><p>Killorglin Credit Union Limited: &euro;2.15 million</p><p>Central Bank resolution-related expenses that have been discharged against the Resolution Fund to date amount to &euro;2.7 million.</p><p>Credit unions are contributing to the Resolution Fund in the form of a Levy.</p><p>The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

This provides that prior to the introduction of new regulations the Central Bank will engage with credit unions. The Central Bank has recently consulted on draft Regulations for Credit Unions on commencement of the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 - Consultation Paper 88, that are proposed to apply to credit unions. The Central Bank has sought views from credit unions on the proposed regulations. This includes regulations on lending, savings, investments and additional services.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to additional services CP88 indicated that the Central Bank is open to proposals from credit unions on new additional services they wish to provide to members where:</p>  <p>  - the proposed additional service is supported by a robust business case;</p>  <p>  - the proposed additional service is not contrary to financial services legislation;</p>  <p>  - the board of directors has a sound appreciation of the nature of the additional service proposed and is fully informed of the strategic, governance, risk management, operational, financial and legal implications involved; and</p>  <p>  - systems and controls are in place to ensure any risks involved in the provision of the additional service are managed and mitigated.</p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the regulations, the Central Bank also indicated in CP88 that where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop, the Central Bank will consider any amendments to the regulations that may be appropriate.</p>  <p>  The consultation closed on 27 February 2015  and a feedback statement and final regulations are planned to be published by end June 2015, following consideration of the submissions received.</p>  <p>  The credit union sector is currently being restructured on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis. The Central Bank is taking a proactive approach to facilitating restructuring and works closely with the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) and individual credit unions on restructuring proposals. The Central Bank supports restructuring proposals that are financially sound, supported by proper risk and control frameworks and have clear leadership and vision for the future direction of the merged credit union. The important objective is to ensure that restructuring achieves better outcomes for current and prospective members, enhances the financial soundness of credit unions and acts as an enabler for future growth and development, setting the sector up for a viable and successful future.</p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions has indicated that as part of the Central Bank's role to support the sustainable and prudent development of the credit union sector, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss areas of credit union business model development and anticipates that these dialogues will provide credit union stakeholders with a well grounded basis to develop sound risk-based developments to their business models. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and while my role and the Central Bank's role in relation to the credit union sector are  distinct, we are both working to protect members' savings and maintain the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.</p></reply>

The regulations will replace and, where appropriate, amend a number of requirements that currently exist in legislation and guidance. Additional requirements have also been included in the regulations, where necessary, to strengthen the regulatory framework.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Consultation Protocol for Credit Unions, issued on 27 November 2012, the Central Bank has conducted a Regulatory Impact Analysis - RIA - on the draft regulations set out CP88. The purpose of the RIA was to examine the impact of different policy options on commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act and to identify the most appropriate option. The RIA also examines the costs, benefits and impacts associated with each option. The RIA was provided as an appendix to CP88 and credit unions and other sector stakeholders were invited to provide additional information or analysis on the potential impact of the draft regulations in their submissions to the Central  Bank on CP88.</p>  <p>  Following review of all submissions received the Central Bank will publish a feedback statement outlining the feedback received, the Central Bank's response and the final regulations for credit unions. All submissions received will be made available on the Central Bank's website at this stage. The Central Bank is planning to publish the feedback statement at the end of June.</p></reply>

Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%. Parts or accessories and training are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.  However, training provided in a work setting, for example for the purposes of health and safety in a company or for medical persons who require such training for their profession, would qualify as exempt vocational training for VAT purposes.</p>  <p>  There is no provision in VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. In addition, Member States may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. In this regard, a reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of defibrillators. Therefore the only rate that can apply to the supply of defibrillators, their accessories and non-vocational training is the standard VAT rate of 23%.</p></reply>

The logo was registered with the Patents Office in 2011.  </p>  <p>  The new logo has been introduced as opportunities arose in the normal course of business.  Since 2010, the new logo has been introduced on a phased basis in  signage for Revenue offices, buildings and vehicles etc. as new orders are placed.  The phased approach to rebranding was adopted to minimise costs.  </p>  <p>  At present, a tender process for uniforms worn by Revenue enforcement staff is being run by the Office of Government Procurement to replace the existing contract which has now expired.  The new tender now  presents an opportunity to implement the 2010 decision in relation to the uniform and associated badge.  Extensive consultations, including with all Divisions involved in wearing Revenue uniforms, have taken place.  The new badge which will incorporate elements of the existing registered logo, will be registered as a trademark of Revenue along with the existing logo.</p>  <p>  The adoption of a new badge does not in any way affect the duties of Revenue officials or delivery of service to the public.  Where customs functions are being performed at ports, airports etc., the relevant areas and offices will be clearly signposted as "Customs".</p></reply>

It showed a total of 42,169 accounts with non-bank lenders which includes both regulated retail credit firms and currently unregulated entities. </p>  <p>  At present, the particular referenced firm is not regulated by the Central Bank.  Unregulated entities that have acquired mortgage loan books are not subject to regulation by the Central Bank and are therefore not subject to the provisions of its Codes, such as the CCMA - though many such firms have stated that they will voluntarily comply with the CCMA. </p>  <p>  However, borrowers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities will be protected by the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 when it is enacted.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan.  This Bill will require entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct.  Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad.  Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated.  Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  The Bill was published in January and Second Stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February.  Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation.  The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill on Committee Stage which has been set for tomorrow (27 May). </p>  <p>  In relation to interest rates, last week I concluded a constructive series of meetings with senior management of Ireland's six main mortgage lenders. </p>  <p>  The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the mortgage market in general and specifically to raise the issue of standard variable mortgage rates charged by the six main lenders.  I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.  The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.  Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers.  In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks.  This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates.  The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments.  Officials in my Department will review progress over the coming weeks and a follow up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget.</p></reply>

These are that the applicant:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the assistance with fuel costs used by members of the Scheme, based on provisional figures the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;48.6 million to the Exchequer in 2014, an increase of &euro;5.1 million on the 2013 cost.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  I regularly receive correspondence from individuals with disabilities that do not meet the criteria but who believe they would benefit from the Scheme.  While I have sympathy with those who do not qualify for Scheme, I cannot, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, expand it further within the current context of constrained resources.</p></reply>

The notional distribution arrangement only applies where the ARF owner is 60 years or over for the whole of a tax year.  The notional distribution was phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% from 2009. </p><p>The notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate.  Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year.  Budget and Finance Act 2011 increased the rate of the notional distribution to 5% of the value of the assets of an ARF, while Finance Act 2012 further increased the rate to 6% in respect of ARFs with values over &euro;2 million.  In last year's Finance Act, however, I reduced the 5% rate to 4% for ARF owners  who are under the age of 70.  This reduction in the imputed distribution rate is intended to reduce the risk that individuals in the age group 60 to 70 years might outlive the funds in their ARFs.</p><p>An important point to note is that, while most ARF owners take actual draw downs at least equal to the notional distribution rate, there is no obligation on them to do so.  The requirement in the legislation is not a statutory minimum drawdown condition.  The only requirement is that tax is paid from the ARF on the notional drawdown amount, whether it is drawn down or not. </p><p>I do not accept the suggestion in the details supplied with this question that the tax on the notional distribution is a tax on capital gains.  We operate what is known as an EET system of pension taxation, whereby contributions to pension arrangements and the build up of the pension assets in the pension fund are both  tax-exempt, while pensions are taxed as income in the pay-out phase.  ARFs, although they are post-retirement investment vehicles and not pension funds <i>per se</i>, none the less  benefit from gross roll-up, which effectively extends the tax exempt fund phase and it is only right that  this deferred taxation is &quot;collected&quot; at the point when the ARF owner accesses his or her funds.  As already mentioned the imputed distribution regime was introduced to encourage ARFs to be used as intended, that is, to provide an ongoing income stream in retirement as a flexible alternative to annuities.  </p><p>I have no plans at this time to further amend the imputed distribution arrangements for ARFs but will bear concerns such as those of the Deputy's correspondent in mind when considering the matter in the future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-26a.535.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600063#WRL02800"><p>As I advised the Deputy in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 282 of 12 May 2015, the extent to which expenses incurred in earning rental income are deductible in computing taxable rents is specified in section 97(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.</p><p>This question relates, <i>inter alia</i>, to the restriction on the deductibility of interest and the non-deductibility of local property tax (LPT) in computing taxable income from residential property.  In the case of interest accruing on or after 7 April 2009 (in so far as it would otherwise be allowable) the deduction available to the landlord is limited to 75% of such interest.  A deduction is not allowed in respect of LPT as it is not one of the specified deductions provided for in section 97(2) of the TCA.</p><p>The Deputy suggests that the restriction, or non-deductibility, of both interest and LPT can result in taxable rental profits arising in situations where a comparison of rents and all rent-related expenditure can result in an apparent loss.  This conclusion appears to be based on an assumption that in the case of income from investment assets (expected to produce income and capital gains) the taxable amount should inherently be computed after allowing a deduction for all costs incurred in earning that income.  However, there is no such general principle in the tax code, and there are many examples of situations where interest deductibility is not allowed in the context of investment assets.  For example, the funding costs of quoted shares are not generally deductible against dividend income from those shares.  The Deputy should also note that while the deductions specified in section 97(2) have generally included interest on borrowed money to purchase, improve or repair the rented premises, that entitlement has been removed or restricted on a number of occasions.  An example was the interest restriction imposed between 1998 and 2002 in respect of certain rented residential property borrowings (following the Bacon reports). </p><p>I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that LPT is an annual self-assessed tax on residential properties in the State and is administered by them in accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) 2012.  LPT is not a rate levied by a local authority and is, therefore, not deductible from gross rents under section 97(2) of the TCA.  As a consequence of the abolition of local authority rates on domestic property in the late 1970s the reference to &quot;any rate levied by a local authority&quot; in section 97(2) of the TCA is now only relevant to commercial property.  </p><p>On the question of whether LPT should be a deductible expense in calculating a landlord's taxable rental income, as I have stated in response to previous Parliamentary Questions on the matter, this was considered in the Thornhill Report, which recommended that LPT should be deductible.  The report, however, recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue, and, for this reason, suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years.  The report also considered that it was for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the timespan for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.  The Government has agreed in principle to accept this recommendation but has not, as yet, decided on the manner in which this will happen or its timing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-26a.557.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600064#WRM01100"><p>Firstly, I wish to clarify for the Deputy that projections of the structural balance set out in the 2015 Stability Programme Update (SPU) are not estimated using either the reference rate or convergence margin.  Rather, the structural balance is calculated using a measure of the output gap (based on potential GDP growth) which is set out in Table 15 of the SPU. </p>  <p>  In contrast, the two concepts referred to by the Deputy - the reference rate and the convergence margin - are used to determine permitted expenditure growth under the other metric used to assess compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact - the expenditure benchmark.</p>  <p>  The 2015 SPU set out an illustrative, ex ante application of the expenditure benchmark for 2016 on the basis of a reference rate of 1.9 per cent.  This is based on the latest European Commission estimates of Ireland's potential GDP growth rate over the years 2010 to 2019. </p>  <p>  In light of major issues raised by myself at the March ECOFIN meeting and followed up at a technical level by officials in my Department, the Commission has amended the way the 10-year average potential growth rate is calculated for all Member States.  The 10-year average reference rate is now calculated annually rather than every three years.  This will allow greater levels of expenditure consistent with the expenditure benchmark for Ireland than was previously the case when reference rates were set for a three-year period.  This is because with an annual update in the rate, the impact of the weak potential GDP growth rates evidenced during the crisis drop out earlier than would previously have been the case and this is a more realistic approach.</p>  <p>  On a purely technical basis, the reference rate consistent with the European Commission's Spring 2015 forecasts for Ireland's potential GDP growth would rise to 2.2 per cent in 2017 increasing steadily up to 2.7 per cent in 2020.</p>  <p>  The convergence margin used in the illustrative application for 2016 in the SPU is 1.8 per cent.  The European Commission, in its assessment of compliance with the expenditure benchmark, will also now update the convergence margin on an annual basis.  However, as the Commission does not publish projected primary expenditure ratios beyond 2016, it is not possible at this point to derive a consistent estimate of the convergence margin for the years out to 2020.</p></reply>

The rate of structural unemployment is not observed and must be estimated empirically. </p>  <p>  The NAWRU estimates consistent with the 2015 Stability Programme Update indicate a rate of structural unemployment falling from just over 10 per cent in 2015 to just under 6&frac12; per cent by 2020. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding improvements negotiated at technical level last year in how the NAWRU is estimated for Ireland, estimates of the NAWRU using this harmonised methodology remain unsatisfactory to the extent that they continue to be overly pro-cyclical - in other words, estimated structural unemployment closely follows the path of actual unemployment.</p></reply>

This estimate includes &euro;90 million in respect of  Public Service Pension Related Deductions.</p>  <p>  The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) is the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to prevent over-funding of pensions through tax-relieved arrangements.  The threshold was initially set at &euro;5 million, which was subsequently reduced to &euro;2.3 million and further reduced in the 2013 Finance Act to &euro;2 million.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to them by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  There is, therefore, no underlying data readily available to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings that would arise specifically from a reduction to the SFT from &euro;2 million to &euro;622,500 as requested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Regarding the cap on the annual earnings limit for determining maximum allowable pension contributions for pension purposes, based on the latest information available, reducing the &euro;115,000 ceiling to &euro;75,000 per annum is tentatively estimated to yield in the region of &euro;100 million.</p>  <p>  As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 (the current life-time limit on tax-free retirement lump sums) to be returned to the Revenue Commissioners, I am advised that they are not in a position to provide definitive figures demonstrating estimated savings to the Exchequer on the impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount to &euro;122,500.</p>  <p>  In relation to the final question, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated yield if the discretionary non-pension deductions and reliefs, which are currently allowable for tax at an individual's marginal rate of income tax, were confined to the standard rate would be in the order of &euro;480 million.</p>  <p>  These estimates, for all Questions, are based on data for 2012, the latest year for which returns have been filed and fully processed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that these various estimates take no account of the behavioural impact which the suggested changes would be bound to have either individually or collectively.</p></reply>

These operators are liable for duty at 1% on the amount of a bet from customers in the State and betting intermediary duty of 15% on the commission charged to customers in the State. </p>  <p>  In 2014, betting duty receipts from traditional bookmakers amounted to &euro;26.2m.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible to be certain about the additional revenue which will be raised for the Exchequer, however, using available data, it has been estimated that the extension of the betting duty, at a rate of 1%, to remote operations could raise up to &euro;25m in a full year.</p>  <p>  It is unlikely that an increase in rates, as proposed by the Deputy, would raise a proportionate amount of revenue. In reality it would be expected that some customers would reduce their gambling expenditure and others might divert their expenditure to other gambling products or to unlicensed operators.</p>  <p>  The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 was only commenced last month and the application of duty to remote operators will not come into effect until 1 August 2015.  I am therefore reluctant to estimate prospective yields from the rates proposed by the Deputy until I have had the opportunity to examine a substantial set of Exchequer returns arising from the new legislation.</p></reply>

Defence</p><p>The first eight categories in this list (1-8) are common, that is categories of goods or services required by all PSBs.  Most of the goods and services contracts that fall into these categories are increasingly procured by the OGP on behalf of all PSBs via national, regional or sectoral frameworks.  The next two categories, namely Plant Hire and Minor Works &amp;amp; Civil's (9 &amp;amp; 10), are primarily purchased by Local Authorities, so the sourcing of these are now led by the Local Government Operational Procurement Centre (LGOPC) hosted by Kerry County Council. </p><p>The next three medical categories on the list (11-13) are led by the HSE, Lab Diagnostics and Library and Farming (14 &amp;amp; 15) are led by the Education Procurement Service and Defence (16) will be led by the Department of Defence. </p><p>The transition to this new model has commenced.  The OGP is increasingly delivering contractual arrangements for common goods and services on behalf of Local Government which, in turn, is delivering contractual arrangements on minor works, civil's and plant hire on behalf of other public bodies, such as HSE, Education, etc. </p><p>The frameworks the OGP is putting in place typically breakdown customer requirements by lots against which suppliers can bid.  This is required by Circular 10/14 which sets out measures that will be taken by all public bodies to facilitate SMEs in bidding for Government contracts.  Lots may be based on goods or services descriptions, usage patterns, size and nature of customer demand and/or geographical location.  The lotting arrangements will be determined by the sourcing strategy and consider customer requirements and market supply factors.  Many services require local delivery and the reformed model will meet those needs. </p><p>Transition to the new model is under way and customer requirements are still being gathered.  A timeframe for completion of the transition will be established when the full workload has been gathered and assessed, and the delivery model gains more experience in operation at scale.  There is no breakdown at a county by county of the work transitioning in the model, however data from 2012 for Local Government indicated an expenditure on all goods and services of &euro;1,080 million.  Expenditure now in Irish Water is included in the figures.  The estimated expenditure on Local Government led categories for 2014 was &euro;805 million under the reformed model, excluding expenditure now in Irish Water. </p><p>The reform of public procurement in Ireland is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery.  The recently published report by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) &quot;Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013&quot; indicates that 93% of public service procurement expenditure was with businesses in the Republic of Ireland and that 66% was with SMEs.  This was based on an analysis of &euro;2.742 billion expenditure across 64 large public service bodies involving over 35,000 suppliers.</p></reply>

Based on this package being split evenly between tax and expenditure, we are envisaging an increase in expenditure of between &euro;600 million and &euro;750 million in 2016 which will be used to accommodate demographic pressures and invest further in providing quality public services.</p>  <p>  For the post-2016 period, the fiscal forecasts in the SES revert to a no policy change position with an annual provision of &euro;300 million included to accommodate demographic pressures arising in sectors such as Social Protection, Health and Education.  These fiscal forecasts show that the average annual structural adjustment over the period 2017 to 2020 will amount to 1.1% of GDP, well in excess of the minimum 0.5% of GDP required under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  It is the policy of the Government, however, to only make the minimum required annual structural adjustment, meaning that further resources will be available to reduce the burden of taxation on low- and middle-income workers and to enhance public services.</p>  <p>  In addition, the ongoing efforts to drive further efficiencies through public service reform and savings arising from reductions due to the improved employment position in certain live register related expenditure can also potentially release funds to deal with demographic demands and for new expenditure policy measures.   </p></reply>

This reform enables public service organisations deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets that they must now operate.  The Government acknowledges, however, the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting. </p>  <p>  In this regard my Department issued Circular 10/14 in 2014 aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with public procurement is easy and low cost.  This guidance set out positive measures that contracting authorities should take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises and highlights practices that are to be avoided which may hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.</p>  <p>  The main thrust of the circular is as follows:</p>  <p>  - buyers are advised to undertake market analysis prior to tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, the competitive landscape, including the specific capabilities of SMEs, etc.</p>  <p>  - the circular promotes transparency in procurement by requiring supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 to be advertised on the Government's electronic tendering portal, e-Tenders;</p>  <p>  - it encourages suppliers including SMEs to fully use e-Tenders and avail of its facilities in relation to registration, e-tendering and automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities;</p>  <p>  - buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value and the circular puts limits on insurance levels for suppliers where possible;</p>  <p>  - it promotes greater use of "open" tendering and less use of "restrictive" tendering;</p>  <p>  -it encourages SMEs to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right or where they may lack certain capabilities necessary to provide a compelling proposition; and,</p>  <p>  - it encourages Contracting Authorities to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so and where it does not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which falls under the remit of my Department, works with the various industry representative bodies (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) to promote the engagement of Irish business in public procurement as well as with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland.  Last year, for example, the OGP supported two "Meet the Buyer" events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by over 1,100 suppliers.  The OGP also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SME's.  This year InterTrade Ireland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SME's to jointly bid for state contracts.  </p>  <p>  In relation to SME participation in public procurement, recent analysis carried out by the OGP indicates that 93% of government procurement expenditure falls within the State and that 66% of this is directly with Irish SMEs.  </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work with suppliers and business representatives on behalf of Government to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that public procurement policies are business friendly. </p></reply>

In 2013, public service and semi-state bodies published 5,826 tender notices.  This process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal .  This portal is the Irish Government's public platform for advertising public sector procurement tenders.  Contracting authorities can use this portal to receive responses electronically from suppliers.  However, a large proportion of tender responses are submitted in hard copy and it is not possible to accurately report on the number of bids for all tender notices published.  Responses in hardcopy are requested where exhibits and sample material is required by contracting authorities for evaluation purposes.</p><p>The eTenders system is also used to automatically send out e-notifications of tender notices published on the system to registered suppliers who have expressed an interest in the particular type of goods, services or works required in the tender notice.  This is driven using the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) codes of the European Commission.  The system also incorporates a Supplier Register that holds company information as entered by each supplier.  Historically many suppliers have registered their company multiple times and often provided incorrect business profiles.  While significant progress was made during 2014 in cleaning up supplier data on the etenders system, the work is still on-going and there is insufficient current information available to report on tendering activity by supplier classification such as small and medium sized enterprises. </p><p>The Office of Government Procurement (OGP), which commenced sourcing operations in 2014, has a clear remit to deliver sustainable savings for the taxpayer through centralising procurement across the public service and encouraging SMEs to fully engage in public procurement.  In this context, the OGP chairs an SME stakeholder group which includes representatives from a range of groups and organisations that represent SMEs in Ireland.  The Office is working with these government agencies and industry representative bodies in developing and implementing policy initiatives, and in driving supplier education and awareness. </p><p>The OGP published a Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis report in March 2015.  This report as the first of its kind for the public service, analysed &euro;2.742 billion of non-pay expenditure data from the Health, Justice, Local Government and Education sectors for 2013 representing a significant portion of overall procurement expenditure for that year.  For the first time, we have a view as to how and with whom that money was spent and the analysis is very encouraging.  The data analysed indicates that 93% of the State s invoiced expenditure is with firms within the State and that 66% of the State s expenditure is with SMEs. </p></reply>

In addition, the Finance Accounts published annually by the Minister for Finance includes, under Statement 1.8(A), information on the State's shareholding and the State's net assets in a number of State companies.  However, I am not aware of any full valuation of the entire portfolio of Ireland's commercial semi-State companies having ever being carried out.   </p>  <p>  The report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities, published in April 2011, considered this question and noted that the total book value of the State's main commercial companies was approximately &euro;8.3 billion at that time, based on aggregate shareholder funds as reported in their then most recently published accounts.  However, that report cautioned that figure should not be taken as a headline estimate of the actual value of the portfolio of companies.  The balance sheet book values of these assets reflect accounting conventions and, in some cases, notional or historical values of key assets, such as land, which may have been assigned to the companies on establishment.  They are therefore not a guide to the actual market value of the companies as valuations depend on many factors.   </p>  <p>  Indicative valuations could of course be undertaken on each of the individual State companies, but actual market value can really only be established accurately in the context of a sale transaction (whereby there is both a willing buyer and a willing seller), and there are no plans to sell any further commercial state companies.</p></reply>

The Information Commissioner is independent in the performance of his or her functions.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, section 37 of the FOI Act 1997 empowered the Commissioner to require the production of information and-or records, and to enter premises occupied by a public body for the purpose of acquiring any information that is required for the purpose of conducting a review.  The equivalent provision of the FOI Act 2014 is section 45.  Notices under Section 37 of the FOI Act 1997 are made only in respect of FOI requests that were processed under the 1997 Act and which were appealed to the Information Commissioner.

Outstanding requests for information are usually resolved quickly and informally.  Occasionally, however, an informal follow-up contact does not suffice and the Office will formally invoke its powers by serving a notice on the body under the relevant statutory provision.  The Commissioner is satisfied with the powers available to him to address failures by public bodies to respond to requests for information by his Office. </p><p>In his Annual Report for 2014, the Commissioner was, however, disappointed to have to report that his Office served nine statutory notices on public bodies in 2014.  While this figure is small relative to the number of engagements between the Office and public bodies, he expressed concern that four of the bodies in receipt of section 37 notices in 2014 were also the recipients of such notices in 2013.  These are University College Dublin, the National Maternity Hospital, Cork County Council, and the Irish Greyhound Board. </p><p>The Office has served three notices on public bodies in 2015 to date, (two under the Act of 2014) arising from their failure to respond to requests for relevant information.  The bodies in question are the National Sports Campus Development Authority, the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA), and St. James' Hospital.  As the reviews in question have not yet been completed, engagements with the bodies in question are ongoing.  </p><p>No prosecutions were taken in 2014 or 2015 for failure to comply with the requirements of section 37 of the FOI Act 1997 (or section 45 of the Act of 2014). </p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, geographic location or organisational size, and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p>  <p>  I would point out that the reform of public procurement in Ireland is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery.  The recently published report by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) "Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013" showed that 93% of public service procurement expenditure was with businesses in the Republic of Ireland.  This was based on an analysis of &euro;2.742 billion expenditure across 64 large public service bodies involving over 35,000 suppliers.</p>  <p>  At EU level there is a growing recognition of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement.  The New EU Directives on Procurement are currently being transposed by the Office of Government Procurement.  They are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.  They are designed to simplify the rules and provide more flexibility for public purchasers.  The directives contain measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups.</p>  <p>  These include:</p>  <p>  - except in justified cases, turnover requirements will be explicitly limited to two times the estimated contract value.</p>  <p>  - acceptance of self-declarations for evaluating the capacity and capability until the award stage</p>  <p>  - the promotion of e-procurement with mandatory electronic availability of procurement documents;</p>  <p>  - contracting authorities to comply or explain in relation to the division of contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  - Member States to provide the Commission with detail on SME participation. (Such monitoring can support consistent application across all Member States and ensure that the objective of greater SME involvement is being delivered.)</p>  <p>  I would also point out that the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), which falls under the remit of my Department, has accelerated some of these key measures in Circular 10/14 which issued in April 2014 including the requirements to tender in an open and transparent process on-line, reductions in bidder's turnover requirements, proportional and reasonable insurance requirements, and breaking larger contracts down into lots.</p>  <p>  In addition the OGP is working with industry representative bodies to promote the engagement of Irish business in public procurement (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland.  Last year, for example, the OGP supported two "Meet the Buyer" events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by over 1,100 suppliers.  The OGP also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SMEs.  </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work on behalf of Government with industry to ensure that winning public procurement contracts is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.  </p></reply>

Targeted increases were provided in areas of priority - particularly social housing, some welfare supports and Education. </p>  <p>  The Government's recent Spring Economic Statement outlined that our estimate of the fiscal space for Budget 2016 is of the order of &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion.  This would allow Government to target increasing gross voted expenditure by &euro;600 million to &euro;750 million in 2016 relative to 2015 spend.  This provides Government with the scope to manage any additional impact of previous Budgets, deal with underlying demographic and spending pressures, and target enhancements in key public services.  The expenditure ceilings set out in Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015-2017 already reflect certain expenditure needs including demographics in Health, Education and Social Protection. </p>  <p>  Separate to this, Departments are able to avail of a capital carryover facility which allows them to carry over a portion of any unspent capital into the next financial year.  This facility has been in place since 2004 and the actual amount that can be carried over is subject to D&aacute;il approval.  The amount to be carried over from 2014 to 2015 is &euro;79 million.  It can be expected that this facility will be available in respect of capital carryover from 2015 to 2016, with the amount involved dependent on the level of unspent voted capital expenditure relative to the 2015 Departmental capital allocations.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Employment Equality Acts (1998 to 2011) PAS aims to ensure that all applicants are treated equally.</p>  <p>  A key element of PAS's ongoing commitment to equality is the monitoring it carries out of its selection processes in order to ensure that its equal opportunities policy is effectively implemented.  The questionnaire referred to in the Deputy's questions is an equality monitoring questionnaire which candidates are invited to complete.  It is important to emphasise that candidates are informed that completion of this questionnaire is completely voluntary, and that the purpose of gathering the information is to ensure that the selection techniques used by PAS are fair to all and that no group is inadvertently discriminated against in the selection process. </p>  <p>  It is also important to stress the point that neither the manner in which candidates respond to this questionnaire, nor the answers that they may provide has any bearing on the manner in which their application is considered.  The information is held by the PAS in a secure data base and is used to produce data in an anonymous statistical format only.</p>  <p>  Therefore, I remain satisfied that PAS is complying both with its legal obligations and with best practice in inviting candidates to complete the questionnaire on a voluntary basis.</p></reply>

Among other provisions, the Scheme provides that contracts for the supply of a gift card or voucher must not include a term that makes the card or voucher subject to an expiry date.  While this and other provisions of the Scheme are only proposals at this stage, I am conscious of the consumer detriment that can result from the application of expiry dates to gift cards.  I will, however, consider carefully all responses to the consultation, including proposals for additional protections for consumers in respect of gift cards and vouchers, before finalising legislative proposals for submission to Government.</p>  <p>  The current terms and conditions of the particular gift card product referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question suggest that this card no longer includes an expiry date but remains valid as long as there is a balance on the card.  A monthly inactive balance charge applies, however, from twelve months after the issue of the card.  The Scheme of the proposed Bill provides that this charge should be assessable for fairness under the provisions on unfair terms in consumer contracts and must be disclosed to the consumer before he or she is bound by the gift voucher contract. </p>  <p>  Gift card products of the kind referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 183/2011) enacted by the Minister for Finance and enforced by the Central Bank.  These Regulations deal with the taking up, pursuit, and prudential supervision of electronic money institutions and the issuance and redeemability of electronic money.  Questions relating to the funds of gift card schemes within the scope of the Regulations are a matter accordingly for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

Provisions in relation to collective bargaining are contained in Part 3 of the Bill.  When enacted, the legislation will put in place the legislative amendments to the Industrial Relations Acts 2001 and 2004 required to give effect to the Programme for Government commitment to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).</p>  <p>  It will provide a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed where collective bargaining does not take place.</p>  <p>  It will ensure that such workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration and conditions of employment and have these determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies.  It provides definitions of key terms as well as guidelines to help the Labour Court identify if internal bargaining bodies are genuinely independent of their employer, and policies and principles for the Labour Court to follow when assessing the comparability of the remuneration and conditions in dispute.</p>  <p>  The Government is conscious that workers in some employments may feel exposed in seeking to improve terms and conditions and that making themselves known may have unwanted consequences.  With this in mind the legislation will bring in significant protection against such victimisation.  This will be done by way of interim relief in the Circuit Court in circumstances where a dismissal is challenged by a worker who believes that he or she was victimised as a result of their participation in the processes of the Act being invoked.</p>  <p>  Provisions are included to ensure the Act is used appropriately and not abused in any way.  There are provisions to ensure cases dealt with are ones where the numbers of workers are not insignificant; provisions to ensure elements of remuneration and conditions of employment are not challenged without regard for the totality of remuneration and conditions of employment; provisions to manage the frequency of reassessment of the same issues. </p>  <p>  In reaching this position, worker and employer stakeholders have played a critical role in assisting Government developing this clear and workable framework and I wish to acknowledge the significant contributions of the representatives of both sides of industry in this regard. </p>  <p>  This new legislative framework will fit Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional, social and economic traditions and its international obligations, and, very importantly, will ensure continued success in creating jobs and attracting investment into the economy.</p></reply>

All of these missions which are supported by Enterprise Ireland and IDA, and with participation by other development agencies as appropriate, are specifically focussed on both promoting Ireland as a location for investment and promoting exports from Ireland.

The group, chaired by Enterprise Ireland, will seek to secure alternative employment for the area affected and ensure that departing workers have access to supports they need from State agencies for retraining, access to social welfare supports, access to advice on employment rights and access to advice and support for those workers who intend to start their own businesses.  The group includes Local Enterprise Offices, IDA Ireland, Solas, Education and Training Boards, Department of Social Protection, MABS and the Citizens Information Bureau. </p>  <p>  The inter-agency group made it clear that it stood ready to meet unions and staff representatives at any stage.  I understand that Enterprise Ireland is meeting with employee representatives this week to discuss in general terms the approach of the agency to supporting restructuring, job protection and job creation. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has had meetings with the company&rsquo;s management on a weekly basis since the announcement of the proposed job losses, and has been in contact with the company on a continuous basis regarding the assistance it could provide for restructuring to minimise job losses.  I have also had discussions with Mondelez at senior executive level and the company has committed clearly to me that it will invest in its operation here with the aim of achieving best in class production process.</p>  <p>  The Company and its workers and the union who represent them are engaged in discussions in the company's restructuring proposals. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland have met with representatives of the workers.  Enterprise Ireland provided further information to the worker's representatives that may be helpful in formulating their counter proposal to the company.  Officials in Enterprise Ireland have also met with Irish management and asked them to give serious consideration to the proposals being put forward by the workers.</p>  <p>  The Labour Relations Commission is available, if required, to assist the parties concerned.

Over the last six years, employment has grown by 42% with exports growing by 63% - an impressive performance given the economic climate over the period.</p><p>The indigenous biotech sub-sector itself employs approximately 100 people with exports of &euro;5m. While this may appear low, most of the businesses that operate in this sub-sector are technological intermediaries &ndash; high end, R&amp;amp;D intensive, patent-protected technology companies involved in drug discovery, drug delivery and new chemical entity developers. Employment in these companies is relatively low but the quality of jobs is typically very high calibre (Masters and Ph.D level). These businesses also have a substantial spend in the wider economy through R&amp;amp;D in particular.</p><p>In addition to supporting the domestic venture capital industry in Ireland, the Government through Enterprise Ireland and the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF &ndash; now the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF)) established Innovation Fund Ireland (IFI). The objective of IFI is to attract international Venture Capitalists (VCs) to establish a presence in Ireland. Information on investments made separately by the NPRF/ISIF under the Innovation Fund Ireland is a matter for my colleague, Mr Michael Noonan, TD, Minister for Finance.</p><p>In March 2012, under the IFI, Enterprise Ireland committed $25m to Sofinnova Ventures, a leading US healthcare venture capital fund, alongside a commitment of $12.5m from the NPRF.  In May 2014, Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;20m with Lightstone Ventures, another leading US venture capital fund, under the IFI with a &euro;10m investment by the NPRF. Lightstone Ventures is actively looking for investment opportunities in the Irish market across the biotech and medtech sectors. </p><p>The most recently published EI Seed and Venture Capital Report 2013 shows that under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2007-2012 cumulatively to 2013, 35% of investment was in the wider Lifesciences sector. At end-2014, those funds in receipt of investment under the IFI, Seed and Venture Scheme 2007-2012 and the Development Capital Scheme were invested in companies with over 3,000 jobs. </p><p>Recently there has been an upswing in investment interest, particularly for biotechs with strong research data. Companies such as Sigmoid, Opsona, Genable, Trino, Solvotrin and Inflection BioSciences have raised tens of millions in investment (from private investors and/or Irish/international VCs). Consequently, I would expect an increase in jobs growth as these companies expand their R&amp;amp;D programmes. </p><p>In relation to IDA Ireland there are now over 5,000 jobs in biotech manufacturing in Ireland with an average salary of &euro;43k (equating to over &euro;200m in annual payroll).  </p><p>There has been exceptionally strong growth in the multinational biotech industry since 2004 when there was only one operational biotech site i.e. MSD in Brinny Co. Cork, formerly Schering Plough. There is now a regional spread of nineteen multinational biotech company investments across Ireland &ndash; some are included in the list attached below. </p><p>As the multinational sector grows, job opportunities will continue to arise for the subsuppliers to the biotech sector, among both indigenous companies (PM Group, DPS, Zenith Automation, various construction firms) and multinational subsuppliers (Waters Corp - 400 employees in Wexford, PPD - 100 employees in Athlone).  </p><p>Some IDA Ireland biotech companies:<blockquote>- Dublin (Pfizer, Amgen, Alexion, MSD, BMS).<br /><br />- Carlow (MSD), Waterford (Sanofi Genzyme).<br /><br />- Cork (J&amp;amp;J, Lilly, MSD, Biomarin), Limerick (Regeneron, Ethicon Biosurgery).<br /><br />- Galway (Mylan), Westport (Allergan), Sligo (Elanco), Athlone (Alexion, Jazz).<br /><br />- IDA has also developed strategic sites ready for additional biotech investment in Dundalk and Galway.</blockquote></p></reply>

Details of the number of these visits are set out in the attached tabular statement.  As Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s core focus is supporting the internationalisation of indigenous companies the Agency does not arrange site visits of a type similar to IDA Ireland.</p><p>Between 2008 - 2010, over 580 jobs were lost in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. Since 2011, the number of people at work in Enterprise Ireland and IDA supported companies has increased by over 270 people since 2010 (a 7% increase). In addition, the Local Enterprise Office Sligo supports 202 companies which employ over 1,100 people. 70 net new jobs were created in 2014 which represents a 6% increase. </p><p>IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to specific locations in Ireland are only part of the long and complicated process involved in attracting foreign direct investment to this country.  These site visits may take place at the beginning or end of the process and in some cases there are no site visits involved.  Site visits, when they do occur, involve new companies visiting a location for the first time and senior executives of existing companies.  For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, IDA Ireland does not comment publicly on the success rate of such site visits. Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.  Additionally, a &euro;150 million property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation&rsquo;s regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s Business and Technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations including Sligo in the North West.  The design and planning process has commenced and full planning permission should be received in the second half of 2015 with construction on site to commence after this and the procurement stages.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, officials of my Department and its agencies are actively engaged with regional stakeholders in the development of individual Action Plans for each of the regions, including the North West Region, which will be published in the near future.  Counties Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim make up the North West Region. </p><p>The provision of roads is outside the remit of my Department, however, IDA Ireland works closely with the Local Authorities through established forums to ensure the North West continues to enhance its offering for prospective clients.  IDA Ireland supports the development of infrastructure that makes the North West a more accessible place to do business and works with stakeholders to see that all aspects of the North West are attractive from a client&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p><b>Table shows the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits to County Sligo since 2011</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>End March 2015</th></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In May 2014 the Government published &lsquo;<i>Construction 2020 &ndash; a Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>&rsquo; to help deliver a competitive, innovative, dynamic, safe and sustainable construction sector, that can make its proper contribution to the economy and to job creation, that is based on best practice, and that is capable of delivering the economic and social infrastructure we need for the future. </p><p>Construction 2020 commits the Government to a detailed set of actions to identify and remove unnecessary blockages to appropriate, high quality development, while ensuring that future growth and activity is sustainable, and underpinned by proper data and analysis. It reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to moving the country away from cycles of boom and bust.</p><p>Construction 2020 contains a detailed programme of work, including 75 time-bound actions across a range of issues including ensuring a highly skilled workforce and ensuring opportunities for construction jobseekers. Progress is being made on securing new employment opportunities for those with the skills and interested in making a career in the construction sector. The most recent data from the CSO indicates an increase in employment of 19,600 over the year to the end of the first quarter of 2015. We are working hard to ensure that there are continued opportunities for those with the skills needed to underpin our economic recovery and of the construction sector. Similarly, the most recent Construction Purchasing Managers Index for April 2015 prepared by Ulster Bank indicates a jump in confidence in the sector, with a reading of 57.2, where a figure above 50 indicates growth. </p><p>Since publication, our commitment to delivery has been further underpinned by the appointment last July of Minister of State Paudie Coffey, with responsibility for coordinating and driving the important work forward. We have also established a dedicated Cabinet Committee to ensure that focus is maintained at the highest level of Government. </p><p>A number of significant milestones have been achieved, and we are seeing welcome and positive signs of recovery in the sector. </p><p>In the specific occupation of quantity surveying, it is estimated that there were 3,200 quantity surveyors in employment in Ireland in Quarter 4 2014.  There have been signs of employment growth in this occupation since the previous year although the overall size of this occupation is relatively small.  Quantity surveyors have appeared in vacancy data showing signs of demand.  Recruitment Agencies have reported some vacancies for quantity surveyors that are difficult to fill but these have been limited to specialised areas and candidates with considerable experience (e.g. at least 5 years) were required.  </p><p>The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland published <i>Employment Opportunities and Skills Requirements for Property and Construction Surveying 2014-2018</i>and<i></i>indicated that the most realistic scenario regarding expected growth opportunities for quantity surveyors over the four year period to 2018 is 506 across all levels of experience of which 207 would be at the graduate level.</p><p>A key aspect of Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2015 is the National Talent Drive Disruptive Reform.  Central to this is strengthening employability of learners and enhancing employer engagement at all levels of education and training. One of the Reform's four stated objectives is to spur a step change in the level of engagement between the education and training system and employers to deliver on skills needed to build the New Economy. Critical to the success of this Disruptive Reform will be active and sustained engagement, and the development of strong partnerships, between the education and training system and employers at a national and regional level.  Clear arrangements to connect employers, enterprise development agencies and the education and training system are crucial to strengthening engagement in areas such as: employer input to the development of education and training provision, creating sufficient and sustainable work placement opportunities, including undergraduate internships/work experience to enhance the employability skills of learners and the development of apprenticeships in new economic sectors.

While over 100,000 extra jobs have been created since the start of the Action Plan process in 2012, not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of economic recovery. That is why the Government is placing an increased emphasis on supporting jobs growth in the regions. </p><p>In February, the Government announced details of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs: Regional</i>initiative which seeks to build on the existing strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation. This initiative will see Action Plans drawn up for eight regions at NUTS III level.</p><p>It is not intended that Regional Action Plans will target individual counties for job creation or investment but, rather, that these plans will identify measures that can be taken to enable the region as a whole to build on its competitive strengths and increase the number of people at work the region.  </p><p>As part of the development of the Action Plan for Jobs for the West Region, a Stakeholder Forum took place in Galway on 23 March 2015.  This event was attended by approximately 150 stakeholders from across the region, the majority of whom were from the private sector.  The objective of the Forum was to identify potential actions for inclusion in the Action Plan for Jobs for the West.  The process produced many ideas for consideration and my officials are currently working through the proposals to determine which of them can be implemented.</p><p>A Regional Project Delivery Team, comprising public bodies from the region, has also been established to assist in the development of the Action Plan and has met three times to date, once each in Mayo, Galway and Roscommon.</p><p>My objective is that six Regional Action Plans, including one for the West region, will be launched by July.  </p><p>The Government has committed up to &euro;250 million in funding over the next five years to support the Regional Action Plans.  &euro;150 million of this funding will support an IDA property programme, while up to &euro;100 million will be made available through Enterprise Ireland for three separate competitive calls which will support innovative and collaborative approaches to job creation across the regions.  The first two of these calls were launched on 15 May, with a closing date of 10 July 2015.  Each call will provide &euro;5 million over the period 2015-2017 for community-based initiatives and for collaborative projects from Local Enterprise Offices respectively.  Further details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.djei.ie.</p></reply>

As a result, there has been a significant increase in applicants to my Department&rsquo; s Regional Veterinary Officess for new herdnumbers and amendments to existing herdnumbers and these are being processed as quickly as possible. In this context, priority is being given to cases relating to applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme where a minimum stocking density requirement exists.</p><p>My Department has also made a number of special arrangements designed to ensure that the non-issue of a herdnumber by the relevant scheme closing date will not impact negatively on applicants under the Basic Payments Scheme. For example, where an applicant under the National Reserve priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; had not been issued a herd number or added to a herd number by the closing date of 31 March 2015, their application under the National Reserve is being accepted once they had applied for a herd number or to be added to a herd number prior to 31 March 2015.  Similarly, applicants under the Young Farmers Scheme who have not been issued a herd number or added to a herd number by the closing date of 29 May 2015 will have their applications under the Scheme accepted once they have applied for a herd number or to be added to a herd number prior to 29 May. </p><p>In addition, my Department is in the process of modifying the iNET online system to provide a facility whereby an on-line application can be submitted by arable farmers with greening obligations or organic farmers in cases where the applicants do not have a herd number or a live herd number. It will, therefore, be possible for Authorised Agents to submit online applications on behalf of farmers, who do not currently hold an active herd number. If any farmers are concerned about this matter, they can contact my Department at 0761 064441 or send an email to<b></b>.

As expected, there has been a considerable increase in activity in regard to herdnumbers arising from the new Basic Payments Scheme negotiated in the context of CAP reform. As a result, there has been a significant increase in applicants to my Department&rsquo;s Regional Veterinary Offices for new herdnumbers and amendments to existing herdnumbers and these are being processed as quickly as possible. In this context, priority is being given to cases relating to applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme where a minimum stocking density requirement exists.</p><p>My Department has also made a number of special arrangements designed to ensure that the non-issue of a herdnumber by the relevant scheme closing date will not impact negatively on applicants under the Basic Payments Scheme. For example, where an applicant under the National Reserve priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; had not been issued a herd number or added to a herd number by the closing date of 31 March 2015, their application under the National Reserve is being accepted once they had applied for a herd number or to be added to a herd number prior to 31 March 2015.  Similarly, applicants under the Young Farmers Scheme who have not been issued a herd number or added to a herd number by the closing date of 29 May 2015 will have their applications under the Scheme accepted once they have applied for a herd number or to be added to a herd number prior to 29 May. </p><p>In addition, my Department is in the process of modifying the iNET online system to provide a facility whereby an on-line application can be submitted by arable farmers with greening obligations or organic farmers in cases where the applicants do not have a herd number or a live herd number. It will, therefore, be possible for Authorised Agents to submit online applications on behalf of farmers, who do not currently hold an active herd number. If any farmers are concerned about this matter, they can contact my Department at 0761 064441 or sent an email to<b></b>. Finally, the Deputy will also probably be aware that I have recently extended the deadline for receipt of GLAS applications.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years , and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  The BDGP has been approved under the agri-environment provisions in the RDP regulations and can make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd. The six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers . Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.</p><p>The six year timeframe provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers allowing them to plan and budget on their farms for the duration of the programme. It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases. In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty however, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations. The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme. As always in such cases, <i>force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease. There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely. </p><p>The BDGP is a substantial commitment to the beef sector over the next 6 years and I will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it is fit for purpose. The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review over the next five years. If aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd. </p>  <p>  One of the requirements of the programme stipulates that from 30 June 2016, at least 80% of the AI used on participating holdings must be from 4 or 5 star bulls on either the terminal or replacement index. This complements the requirement that where a stock bull is used, at least one stock bull on the holding on the 30 June 2019 must be a genotyped 4 or 5 star bull on either the terminal or replacement index. </p>  <p>  There is a very wide range of AI bulls available for pedigree beef breeding that are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index. For example, ICBF recently completed its listing of recommended sires for bull breeders involved in the Gene Ireland maternal beef breeding program. In total there are some 164 bulls in that catalogue of which 151 (92%) are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index within or across breeds.   </p>  <p>  For imported bulls, the ICBF assigns a rating based on the data available for each bull at that time. The approach used to assigning this rating is in line with that used for all other bulls under the eurostar rating system. It would not be appropriate to assign higher ratings to imported bulls without any scientific rationale for doing so. It is important that any rating is based on objective, scientific criteria which the ICBF can justify to each and every farmer using such bulls. </p>  <p>  The fact that 20% of the AI used can come from other types of bulls gives scope for pedigree breeders that wish to use some outcross sires as part of the scheme. ICBF calculates a euro star evaluation for imported sires based on their foreign data so that they can be utilised under the programme. For example, there were 166 new beef AI sires coded last year, both Irish and internationally bred, and of these 69% are already compliant with the scheme. Indeed, ICBF can provide an indication of the likely euro star rating to be given to such bulls when imported into Ireland and it is likely that AI companies and breeders will be much more vigilant regarding the type of &ldquo;outcross&rdquo; bulls that they purchase/import in the future.</p></reply>

Where such over-capacity is identified in the Fleet Report, an action plan must be included in the Report, specifying the adjustment targets necessary to restore balance and the tools that will be employed to achieve those targets. The most recently published Fleet Report for 2013 did not identify structural over-capacity in any of our fleet segments, and so no decommissioning is presently recommended. The Fleet Report for 2014 is being compiled at present and will be available shortly.</p>  <p>  In accordance with article 34 of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation (508/2014), a decommissioning scheme may only be introduced where it is foreseen as a tool of an action plan under article 22 of the CFP. While there is presently no action plan recommending decommissioning for any fleet segment, I included an indicative allocation of &euro;10 million for decommissioning in the draft Seafood Development Programme I published for consultation on 27 March 2015. I will be finalising that Programme in the coming weeks and will take account of the conclusions of the 2014 Fleet Report in this regard. Should a decommissioning scheme be included, details concerning scheme design and implementation will be developed in the coming months.</p></reply>

These have since been published on my Department&rsquo;s website as part of the Commonage Information File and can be freely viewed by anybody. Under GLAS, the new agri-environment scheme under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme, a single Commonage Management Plan must be drawn up for each participating commonage, which will outline the appropriate stocking densities for each GLAS shareholder. As part of that process, which will be undertaken by a trained GLAS advisor working directly with the shareholders themselves, it is open for different stocking densities to be proposed, on foot of the advisor&rsquo;s own assessment of the situation on the ground.

This inspection identified non-compliances with the cross-compliance requirements under the Nitrates Regulations relating to clean water from sheds being allowed to flow onto soiled yards adding to the volume of soiled water.  This soiled water was being collected in slurry lagoon which was only partially floored and was overflowing on the date of inspection leading to direct and indirect discharge to ground water.</p>  <p>  As similar breaches under the Nitrates Regulations had been identified within the previous three years, the regulatory provisions required that the rules on reoccurrence be applied and this resulted in a penalty of 60% being applied against the 2013 Direct Schemes payments.</p>  <p>  The person named was notified of this decision on 31 January 2014.

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.</p>  <p>  The BDGP was launched on 5 May and to date my Department has received in almost 13,000 applications.  The scheme will close to applications on 29 May so as to begin implementing the various elements of the Programme and to ensure payments to farmers commence later this year.  The BDGP builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and all of the actions will already be familiar to most farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements.</p>  <p>  I am aware of concerns expressed by some farmers, a number of which are fuelled by a misunderstanding of the programme's terms and conditions in this regard.  Both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers.  I also issued some updated information on the contents of the scheme last week, particularly as regards the 6-year requirement and the penalties which apply under the scheme.  In addition, farmers can consult the Department&rsquo;s website for more information and I would encourage them to contact the Department&rsquo;s helpline if they have any further questions.</p>  <p>  I have, of course, already indicated that the programme will be subject to a mid-term review.  I will monitor its operation in the meantime and make appropriate adjustments where possible in consultation with the commission in a manner consistent with the regulations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-26a.814.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600069#WRR03400"><p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme and will provide suckler farmers in Ireland with funding of some &euro;300 million over the next 6 years.  The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  It is a unique opportunity for farm participants to improve the efficiency and profitability of their herds, with significant state support.</p><p>It can also make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd and has been approved as an agri-environment measure under the Rural Development Programme.  The six-year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers.  Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.</p><p>The six-year timeframe for the BDGP provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers, allowing them to plan and budget on their farms for the duration of the programme.  It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases.  In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty.  However, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach proposed reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations.  The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme.  As always in such cases, <i>force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease.  There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.</p><p>Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that.  Payment to scheme participants is on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.  All of the costs to the farmer, including in terms of time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission.  The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing and this genotyping cost will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment.  The cost of the genotyping will be finalised following the conclusion of a public tendering process undertaken by the ICBF in relation to laboratory analysis, tissue tags and the DNA chip.  It is expected that this will result in a reduced sampling/genotype cost compared to the 2014 scheme.</p><p>The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo;.  The number of &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo; will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme.  For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype 9 cows/heifers/calves/stock bulls in each year of the programme without repetition.  In specific circumstances, 2015 may be used as the base year.</p><p>While the level of testing required has increased compared to the 2014 pilot scheme, the payment to the farmer has also increased significantly so the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes.  The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP.</p><p>The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified.  The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development.  This increased level of genotyping also adds value to the breeding indexes.</p><p>The BDGP is a substantial commitment to the beef sector over the next 6 years and I will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it is fit for purpose.  The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review.  If aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission.  For now I am satisfied that the scheme provides the long-term support that is required to ensure the future sustainability of our suckler herd, within the parameters laid down by the relevant regulations.</p></reply>

To date, 541 cases have been referred to the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) Appeals Committee for consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy of the Land Parcel Identification System which underpins the direct payments.  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter.  In that letter, farmers are informed of the need to examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all unfarmed land, ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.  There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate.  They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis.  These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers.</p>  <p>  In the letters, which issue where ineligible areas have been identified, considerable detail regarding the issues and maps to advise of the particular over-claims are provided.  In addition to this information, farmers are also informed of the appeals process, should they disagree with my Department&rsquo;s findings.  The appeals process I have introduced is both robust and comprehensive.  In the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department and should it be the case they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independently-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee.</p></reply>

The scheme is very important for this country, especially from an economic perspective, as it is envisaged it will contribute to the support of almost 100,000 Irish farm families.  To ensure continued support for equine enterprises under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, technical adjustments were necessary from the previous scheme to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose equine enterprises continue to make significant contributions to the maintenance of a viable rural community, thus achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows:</p>  <p>  The new Scheme requires applicants to maintain 0.15 Livestock units per forage hectare of the holding calculated over the twelve months of the calendar year 2015.  While horses are not eligible for the stocking density calculation under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.

EU Regulation 1380/2013 sets down Ireland&rsquo;s Fishing Capacity ceiling from 1 January 2014.  This ceiling is expressed in terms of gross tonnes (GT) and engine power (kilowatts &ndash; kW) and covers the total fishing capacity of fishing vessels flying Ireland&rsquo;s flag.  Each Member State must manage entries into its fleet and exits from its fleet in such a way that the entry of new capacity into the fleet is compensated by the previous withdrawal of at least the same amount of capacity.  This is known as the &ldquo;entry/exit regime&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  As Minister I have responsibility for policy in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing under Section 3(3) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by Section 99 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I am precluded from getting involved in individual cases, or a group of cases, with which the licensing authority is or may be concerned under Section 3(5) of the 2003 Act.</p>  <p>  The Irish fishing fleet is divided into five segments in accordance with Ministerial Policy Directive 2 of 2003, as amended.  The segments are as follows: Refrigerated Seawater (RSW) Pelagic Segment; Polyvalent Segment; Beam Trawler Segment: Specific Segment:Aquaculture Segment.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the policy sets out a number of sub-segments of the fleet including a sub-segment for vessels exclusively using pots, vessels targeting scallops and polyvalent vessels under 18 m in length.  The transfer of capacity between the segments and sub-segments is not permitted, and equivalent &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; capacity must be taken out of the segment or sub-segment into which a vessel is being introduced.  In order for vessels to qualify for either a mackerel and/or herring Authorisation, vessels must be licensed with 100% capacity having the required track record as stipulated under the individual mackerel and herring fleet policies. </p>  <p>  Please note that fishing capacity is privately owned and is traded commercially, bought and sold independently of the Department and the Licensing Authority.  The request for a change in licensing policy involving the removal or amalgamation of segments or sub-segments would have a substantial impact on the Irish fishing fleet.  The current fleet policy allows operators to introduce new or replacement vessels and to modify existing vessels subject to the operator providing replacement capacity from the relevant segment and sub-segment.  The current policy has been put in place over many years and a change, as requested, would impact many elements of the fishing fleet.  It could potentially have significant impacts on access to fishing resources and the management of quotas.  I do not want to create an expectation we can go down the road of &ldquo;safety tonnage&rdquo;, which is what was available based on the application of very strict criteria, in the past, because &ldquo;safety tonnage&rdquo; is specifically not provided for in the new Common Fisheries Policy.</p>  <p>  There are many diverse views within the fishing industry and these often conflict.  It is important for the further development of the industry that views on any changes to be made are debated widely internally in the industry and that there is the maximum possible level of agreement and support within the industry for any proposed changes being sought by the industry.  Where the industry, preferably through the recognised representative structure of Producer Organisations, makes a business case for changes to the licensing policy on the basis of changed circumstance, I would examine any such case.  I would encourage the group of vessel owners who are calling for this major change to long-standing policy to engage widely with the Producer Organisations so that any proposed changes can be brought forward with widespread support from across the industry.  The changes being proposed would significantly impact many operators in the industry.  Any amendments to licensing policy that I might bring forward will be subject to a public consultation with stakeholders.</p></reply>

Such allocation is restricted to those who &lsquo;produced, reared or grew agricultural products&rsquo; in 2013 in those sectors traditionally supported under Pillar I in Ireland, i.e. the beef, dairy, sheep and arable sectors.</p>  <p>  The original allocation of entitlements in Ireland under the Single Payment Scheme was based on the receipt of a direct payment in the period 2000-2002.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case this resulted in entitlements being allocated to farmers who were paid coupled support under the Suckler Cow Scheme, and/or the Special Beef Premium Scheme, and/or the Slaughter Premium Scheme, and/or the Ewe Premium Scheme and/or the Arable aid scheme.  The farming of equines, pigs, poultry, horses etc during this original reference period did not attract the allocation of entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme and consequently they are not included in the Basic Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  The application of the Scottish Derogation to the traditional sectors supported by direct payments is consistent with the overall implementation of the Single Payment Scheme and the Basic Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  Connemara ponies are eligible for payment under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme (formerly the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme) providing they meet the breeding enterprise criteria as laid down in the terms and conditions of that scheme.</p></reply>

The Lobster (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 591 of 2014), which I signed into law in December 2014, concluded the roll-out of changes to lobster conservation measures which I had announced in May 2014.  The regulations replace and revoke previous regulations with the objective of supporting the reproductive potential of the stock.  In that regard, I am conscious of my responsibilities under the Common Fisheries Policy to strive for sustainable inshore fisheries in the long term.</p>  <p>  The measures which now apply to the lobster fishery include:</p>  <p>  - Continued legal protection in the aforementioned regulations for lobsters v-notched under an incentivised National Lobster V-Notching Programme which provides financial support for fishermen engaged in conservation practice of v-notching live lobsters and returning them to sea to contribute to the reproductive capacity of the stock;</p>  <p>  - The introduction of a new maximum landing size for lobster of 127mm, which took effect from 1 January 2015 through the aforementioned regulations;</p>  <p>  - An increase in grant aid to fishermen for the voluntary v-notching of lobsters from the existing rate of 55% to a new maximum of 75% of the market price;</p>  <p>  - Transitional arrangements that provide fishermen with grant aid of up to 75% of the market price for v-notching oversize lobsters and returning them alive to sea during the first two years of the maximum landing size measure;</p>  <p>  - EU regulations prohibiting the landing of lobsters of less than 87 mm in carapace length.   </p>  <p>  The new maximum landing size measure is expected to be less economically penalising than other possible alternative measures and particularly when provided with financial support under the v-notching programme during the transitional arrangements.  National figures from 2014 following the introduction of the new funding rate record an increase of 19,000 lobsters presented for v-notching, bringing the total to over twice the number conserved in 2013, and more than &euro;230,000 was provided to fishermen in financial support for this worthwhile conservation practice.  The scheme is operated by an Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Future funding for the lobster conservation programme is being examined in the context of the forthcoming Seafood Development operational programme.</p></reply>

As a result, there has been a significant increase in applications to my Department&rsquo;s Regional Veterinary Offices for new herdnumbers and amendments to existing herdnumbers and these are being processed as quickly as possible and currently just over 3,500 applications remain to be finalised.  In this context, priority is being given to cases relating to applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme where a minimum stocking density requirement exists.</p><p>Given the particular circumstances this year, my Department has made a number of special arrangements designed to ensure that the non-issue of a herdnumber by the relevant scheme closing date will not impact negatively on applicants under the Basic Payments Scheme.  For example, where an applicant under the National Reserve priority categories of &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; had not been issued a herd number or added to a herd number by the closing date of 31 March 2015, their application under the National Reserve is being accepted once they had applied for a herd number or to be added to a herd number prior to 31 March 2015.  Similarly, applicants under the Young Farmers Scheme who have not been issued a herd number or added to a herd number by the closing date of 29 May 2015 will have their applications under the Scheme accepted once they have applied for a herd number or to be added to a herd number prior to 29 May.</p><p>In addition, my Department is in the process of modifying the iNET online system to provide a facility whereby an on-line application can be submitted by arable farmers with greening obligations or organic farmers in cases where the applicants do not have a herd number or a live herd number.  It will, therefore, be possible for Authorised Agents to submit online applications on behalf of farmers, who do not currently hold an active herd number.  If any farmers are concerned about this matter, they can contact my Department at 0761 064441 or sent an email to<b></b>.  Finally, the Deputy will also probably be aware that I have recently extended the deadline for receipt of GLAS applications.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-26a.877.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052600070#WRS04700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 416, 420, 422 and 425 together.</p><p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme and will provide suckler farmers in Ireland with funding of some &euro;300 million over the next 6 years.  The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.</p><p>The replacement strategy is one of the main new elements of the BDGP over and above existing schemes for the suckler beef sector.  The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and ultimately farmer margins.  This scheme is putting &euro;300 million into accelerating genetic improvement and so the requirement for farmers to move towards using 4- and 5-star rated stock bulls and heifers is essential to its objectives.  I am fully aware that these requirements will take time which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time.</p><p>If this is to be successful, it is vital that farmers are aware of the ratings of the animals currently on their farms and the ratings of the animals they may be purchasing.  Farmers will be informed of the details of animals on their farms with eurostar ratings shortly after applying for the scheme.  Scheme applicants will then be able to use this information, together with other details provided to them with regarding their number of eligible animals and eligible hectares, to make a final assessment of their commitment to the scheme.  There will then be a period of time available to farmers to withdraw from the scheme, without penalty or obligation, should they feel that the scheme is not suitable to their farm enterprises.</p><p>In addition, my Department is also exploring means of making information on eurostar ratings widely available and I will be advising livestock marts to play their part in this regard.  I am confident that the provision of this information, together with the advice and guidance which scheme applicants will receive on an ongoing basis, will ensure that applicants are in position to meet all of the scheme requirements which are carefully phased-in over a number of years.</p><p>The BDGP is an area based payment whereby the number of calved cows on the holding in 2014 is divided by a standard stocking density of 1.5 calved cows/hectare in order to establish the number of eligible hectares for payment.  In line with the requirements of the European Commission, the number of eligible hectares declared each year cannot reduce by more than 20% during the course of the programme.  If a farmer knows in advance that some land rented to him will not be available from a point in time, then he/she should make every effort to ensure that he/she has sufficient land available.  This is a mandatory scheme requirement although <i>force majeure</i>provisions will be in place to deal with unexpected circumstances such as compulsory purchase orders.</p><p>The vast majority of farmers applying for the BDGP will have significantly more land than is required in order to receive full payment.  Based on participants in the Beef Genomics Scheme, nearly half of farmers (46%) will have a stocking density of less than 0.5 calved cows/hectare whereas 90% of farmers have a stocking density below 1 calved cow per hectare.  As an example, a farmer with 10 calved cows and a stocking density of 0.5 will have access to 20 hectares but will only require 6.66 hectares for the purposes of payment under the BDGP.  Even if this farmer had a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare, he/she would have 50% more land than he/she requires.  The vast majority of farmers come under a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare and I believe the relatively high stocking density of 1.5 established under the BDGP should provide a sufficient buffer for situations arising on most farms.</p><p>The BDGP has been approved under the agri-environment provisions in the Rural Development regulation and can make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd.  The six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers.  Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.</p><p>It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases.  In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty however, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations.  The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme.  As always in such cases, <i>force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease.  There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.  </p><p>The BDGP is a substantial commitment to the beef sector over the next 6 years and I will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it is fit for purpose.  The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review over the next five years.  If that finds that aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission.</p></reply>

Therefore, a long with the Taoiseach, I was very pleased to welcome Premier Li Keqiang and a large Ministerial delegation, including Minister for Agriculture Han Changfu, on a visit to the Garvey farm in Co. Mayo on 17 May.</p><p>This visit represented an invaluable opportunity to demonstrate the best of Irish farming to the Chinese Government.  The farm is typical of Ireland&rsquo;s natural, grass-based, sustainable production systems.  It combines traditional values and the best of nature with science and technology, to produce the highest quality food, with three generations of the family working together. It was a wonderful showcase for Irish food production, and I would again like to thank the Garvey family for their enthusiasm and hospitality in welcoming the large delegation to their farm and their home. </p><p>During our discussions in the Garvey farmhouse, Premier Li Keqiang was particularly interested in learning more about Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Origin Green&rsquo; sustainability programme, under which farmers and food producers set and achieve measurable sustainability targets, which are independently verified and audited. </p><p>Following the bilateral meeting between the Taoiseach and Premier Li in Ashford Castle, Minister Han Changfu and I signed a joint statement on deepening agricultural cooperation, including through:</p><p>- the establishment of an Ireland-China Joint Committee on Agricultural Cooperation and</p><p>- the development of a Medium-Term Action Plan on Agricultural Co-operation.</p><p>Ireland greatly appreciates the lifting of the ban on Irish beef imports by China, which I regard as a powerful endorsement of Ireland&rsquo;s high standards by an administration for which food safety is a critical prerequisite for trade. In Ashford Castle, Premier Li Keqiang set out the next steps before beef exports commence, which will involve a visit in the near future by a leading official from AQSIQ (China&rsquo;s quarantine and inspection bureau), followed by a team of experts visiting Ireland for an assessment. </p><p>Premier Li Keqiang tasted Irish beef for the first time during his farm visit, and later, in Ashford Castle, gave the following strong public endorsement of Irish beef in his remarks to the press, which will be of huge promotional value when the details of market access are agreed and beef exports commence:</p><p><i>&ldquo;I want to say that the very high quality and safe Irish beef will turn out to be very popular, I have confidence, among the Chinese consumers&rdquo;.</i></p></reply>

As the reduction did not impact the level of penalty on the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, no additional payment was due in respect of this scheme.</p><p>I understand that the person named has recently appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  In the event that the person named is dissatisfied with the outcome it is open to them to raise the matter with the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The person named was advised at that stage of the right to appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office if he was not satisfied by the review of the Regional Inspector. </p>  <p>  The original clawback amount on the REPS4 contract in this case was &euro;25,693.96.  There was a further in-payment penalty in relation to the 2012 REPS4 Scheme Year of &euro;10,647.82, bringing the total debt due to the Department of &euro;36,341.78.  The person named was given details of the breakdown of how these clawbacks and penalties arose in an explanatory letter from the Department.  At this stage, an amount of &euro;20,813.71 has already been recouped through the REPS4 Scheme and other Department Schemes.  There remains an outstanding debt due to the Department of &euro;15,528.07.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.</p><p>The BDGP has been approved under the agri-environment provisions of the Rural Development Regulations and can make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd.  The six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers.  Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.</p><p>The six year timeframe for the BDGP provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers allowing them to plan and budget on their farms for the duration of the programme.  It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases.  In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty however, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations. The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme. As always in such cases, <i>force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease.  There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.</p><p>The BDGP builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and most of the actions will already be familiar to most farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements.  The replacement strategy is one of the main new elements of the BDGP over and above existing schemes for the suckler beef sector.  The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and ultimately farmer margins.  The requirement for farmers to move towards using 4 and 5 star rated stock bulls and heifers is essential to the programmes objectives.  An adjustment to allow the use of 3 star animals and heifer calves under 16 months would require engagement with the Commission and would jeopardise the operation of the programme. </p><p>In addition, I should note that many farmers are already well on the way to meeting the requirement for 4 and 5 star animals.  Analysis undertaken by ICBF of the 2014 Beef Genomics Scheme has indicated that some 30% of herds are already compliant with the requirement for female animals in 2020 i.e. that the number of 4 and 5 star heifers are equal to 50% of the reference animals on each farm.  Furthermore, 52% are already compliant with the 2018 requirement.  All farmers will receive comprehensive training, and ongoing information and advice to assist them in introducing the required breeding strategy.  I am also aware that these requirements will take time to introduce which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time included in the design of the programme.</p><p>The requirement for those farmers using a stock bull is that at least one of the bulls on the holding on 30 June 2019 must be a genotyped 4 or 5 star bull on either the terminal or replacement index.  There are separate provisions for farmers using AI. </p><p>I do not believe this represents a large additional cost on the sector given the large number of 4 and 5 star bulls already on suckler farms and the benefits will outweigh any such costs.  Analysis undertaken by the ICBF has shown that there will be a sufficient quantity of such bulls available for BDGP herds.  Approximately 10,000 pedigree bulls will be eligible for the scheme each year whereas, based on the 2014 Beef Genomic Scheme, the BDGP herds would require about 7,000 such animals each year.  There is also a very wide range of AI bulls available for pedigree beef breeding that are 4 or 5 stars on either the replacement or terminal index. </p><p>The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo;.  The number of &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo; will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme.  For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype 9 cows/heifers/calves/stock bulls, in each year of the programme, without repetition.</p><p>The 60% of the herd that will be genotyped each year represents an increase compared to the 15% under the 2014 Beef Genomic Scheme, however the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes.  The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP. </p><p>The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified.  The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development. This increased level of genotyping improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and, importantly, ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star females required by BDGP herds.  </p><p>Of course, like all RDP schemes, the payments under this programme are calculated to cover costs and income foregone including a substantial overhead.</p><p>The cost of the genotyping will be finalised following the conclusion of a public tendering process undertaken by the ICBF in relation to laboratory analysis, tissue tags and the DNA chip. It is expected that this will result in a reduced sampling/genotype cost compared to the 2014 scheme.</p><p>Participants in the BDGP will receive advice and guidance on an ongoing basis to assist them in meeting the requirements.  The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review.  If aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission in a manner consistent with the relevant regulation.</p></reply>

The BDGP will accelerate improvement in the crucial area of environmental sustainability in the national herd through the application of genomic technology and will bring about long-term strategic improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd. It will also position Ireland as a global leader in the application of genomics technology and confirm our reputation as one of the most important export focused beef producing nations in the world.</p>  <p>  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that. Payment to scheme participants is on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.</p><p>The BDGP was launched on 5 May and to-date my Department has received almost 13,000 applications.  The BDGP builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and all of the actions will already be familiar to most farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements.  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that.  Payment to scheme participants is on basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.  This is a statutory requirement for RDP schemes.  All of the costs to the farmer, including a substantial overhead for time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission.  The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing, and this will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment. </p><p>The cost of completing a carbon navigator in conjunction with an approved advisor will be covered separately and will not be deducted from the farmer&rsquo;s payment.  The farmer will also be provided with an additional &euro;166 to compensate for the time and travel costs associated with attending the training course.</p><p>There has been some concern regarding the requirement to join the scheme for a 6 year period.  This multi-annual approach is required for all EU funded agri-environmental schemes and, in any event, should facilitate long term planning on individual farms.  We have also included <i>force majeure</i>clauses in the Terms and Conditions to deal with situations where a farmer has to withdraw from the programme due to circumstances beyond his or her control such as illness or disease. <i></i>There is also a facility to transfer the land in certain circumstances, including inheritance.  In any event, the vast majority of farmers will have far more land than they will need to draw down their full BDGP payment and a re free to dispose of or transfer surplus land as they wish.</p><p>The replacement strategy is one of the main new elements of the BDGP.  The need for genetic improvement in the Irish suckler herd is widely acknowledged, and the adoption of genomic technology is a critically important tool in increasing production efficiency and ultimately farmer margins.  This scheme is putting &euro;300 million into accelerating genetic improvement and so the requirement for farmers to move towards using 4 and 5 star rated stock bulls and heifers is essential to its objectives.  I am fully aware that these requirements will take time to introduce which is why there is a 5 year lead-in time provided in the scheme design.</p><p>Finally, I would like to add that both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers.  I also issued some updated information on the contents of the scheme last week, particularly as regards the 6-year requirement and the penalties which apply under the scheme.  In addition, farmer&rsquo;s can consult the Department&rsquo;s website for more information and I would encourage them to contact the Department&rsquo;s helpline if they have any further questions.</p></reply>

While the BDGP is an area based payment, the area upon which payment is made is based on the number of suckler cows calving in the herd in 2014.  It was not possible to select a future date because a scheme approved under the RDP could not provide an incentive for increasing stock numbers.</p><p>Selecting 2014 also adds a measure of administrative simplicity for farmers that will facilitate early payments under the scheme.  The provisions do, however, allow the use of 2015 as an alternative base on an exceptional basis for new entrants, applicants impacted by <i>force majeure</i>circumstances in 2014 and for those who would have been excluded from the scheme as a result of a reduction in stock numbers in 2015.  Such farmers should apply for the scheme before the 29 May deadline and the decision regarding whether to use 2015 as basis, where appropriate, will be decided after the closing date for applications.</p><p>I should also add that the above provisions relate only to the calculation of payment under the BDGP &ndash; there is no restriction whatsoever on individual farmers increasing their output and cow numbers during the course of the scheme.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.</p><p>The BDGP is an area based payment whereby the number of calved cows on the holding in 2014 is divided by a standard stocking density of 1.5 calved cows/hectare in order to establish the number of eligible hectares for payment.  In line with the requirements of the European Commission, the number of eligible hectares declared each year cannot reduce by more than 20% during the course of the programme.  If a farmer knows in advance that some land rented to him will not be available from a point in time, then he/she should make every effort to ensure that he/she has sufficient land available.  This is a mandatory scheme requirement although <i>force majeure</i>provisions will be in place to deal with unexpected circumstances such as compulsory purchase orders.</p><p>The vast majority of farmers applying for the BDGP will have significantly more land than is required in order to receive full payment.  Based on participants in the Beef Genomics Scheme, nearly half of farmers (46%) will have a stocking density of less than 0.5 calved cows/hectare whereas 90% of farmers have a stocking density below 1 calved cow/hectare.  As an example, a farmer with 10 calved cows and a stocking density of 0.5 will have access to 20 hectares but will only require 6.66 hectares for the purposes of payment under the BDGP.  Even if this farmer had a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare, he/she would have 50% more land than he/she requires.  The vast majority of framers come under a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare and I believe the relatively high stocking density of 1.5 established under the BDGP should provide a sufficient buffer for situations arising on most farms.</p></reply>

The Department will pay for this element of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme.</p><p>The Carbon Navigator is a software tool developed by Teagasc and Bord Bia to help farmers engage with practical measures that can improve on farm profitability while at the same time enhancing environmental performance. Producing more from fewer inputs is central to global sustainability initiatives and the Origin Green Programme. </p><p>The Carbon Navigator, which is available via Teagasc and private farm advisors, looks at six practical measures that farmers will be considering as they run their enterprise:</p><p>- The length of the grazing season</p><p>- Age at first calving</p><p>- Calving rate</p><p>- Daily live-weight gain</p><p>- Fertiliser usage, and</p><p>- Slurry management.</p><p>The Carbon Navigator tool is a discussion facilitator to help farmers examine current practices and identify any areas for potential improvement. One of the main reasons the Department has required that the navigator is completed with an approved advisor is that by discussion with the advisor, realistic targets can be set and more importantly a clear outline of what needs to be done to achieve these targets can be agreed. By having an advisor involved it helps ensure that the targets set are appropriate for the farm.</p><p>The advisor will be available throughout the programme to help the farmer with any challenges they encounter in achieving their targets.</p><p>Farmers who complete the Navigator can see profitability gains from each element that the tool records:</p><p>- A 10 day increase in grazing season reduces costs by &euro;25 per cow</p><p>- Reducing age at first calving from 29 months to 28 months improves returns by &euro;50 per cow</p><p>- Improving calving rate from 80% to 85% lifts returns by around &euro;45 per cow</p><p>- Increasing lifetime average daily gain from 900g to 1,000g lifts returns by around &euro;63 per head</p><p>- Reduction in Nitrogen fertiliser use by 10kg per Ha reduces costs by &euro;10 per hectare.</p></reply>

The reforms are designed to drive real, lasting change in the sector and will tackle abuse of the immigration regime and labour market, improve the overall quality of offering to international students, and improve protection for learners, whilst safeguarding the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers in line with the goals of Ireland&rsquo;s International Education Strategy.</p>  <p>  The adjustment to the working hours arrangements of international students is an integral part of the overall reform of this sector which balances the interests of legitimate operators with necessary protection of students and of Ireland's international reputation.</p>  <p>  The key reforms include:</p>  <p>  - In relation to higher education programmes, only programmes which are accredited by Irish awarding bodies, or those accredited by universities in the EU that meet quality assurance standards comparable to those of Irish accredited programmes, will be permitted to recruit international students, with a few specific exceptions.</p>  <p>  - With regard to English language programmes, only those providers who can demonstrate that they have reached an acceptable quality standard will be permitted to appear on the list from 1 October 2015. They are being given an opportunity to do that.</p>  <p>  - The standard 12 months immigration permission for the purposes of attending a 25 week English language programme is being reduced to 8 months with effect from 1 October 2015. Students will still be permitted 3 such permissions and there will be no reduction in overall tuition.</p>  <p>  - All institutions will have to comply with new requirements including a clear declaration of ownership, shadow directors, physical infrastructure and teaching capacity.</p>  <p>  - A number of measures designed to protect students are being introduced including compulsory learner protection arrangements and a separate account facility to safeguard student advance payments.</p>  <p>  As part of this reform process the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration of my Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau are working closely together to further enhance the inspection regime in respect of colleges seeking to recruit non-EEA students.</p></reply>

However, a 2013 UK Court of Appeal judgment necessitated a review of the disclosure provisions in both the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Spent Convictions Bill.  That review has been completed and amendments to the Vetting Act and consequential amendments to the Spent Convictions Bill are currently being drafted.</p><p>I intend to bring the amendments to the Bill before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with a view to enactment in the autumn. The Bill already provides that a conviction for a motoring offence can become spent if the sentence for the offence is a term of imprisonment of 12 months or less.</p><p>In addition, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed. These include any district court convictions for motoring offences which are over seven years old.</p><p>A copy of this Administrative Filter is set out.</p><p><b>Garda Vetting Procedures</b></p><p><b>Administrative Filter</b></p><p>In anticipation of the amendment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, an administrative filter in respect of Garda Vetting Unit Disclosures will operate in accordance with the following procedural guidelines. </p><p><b>A.

District Court Convictions which will not be disclosed: </b></p><p>1) Motoring Offences: </p><p>District Court convictions for motoring offences will not be disclosed after 7 years even where more recent offences have been committed. This is because it is considered that old minor motoring offences would not be relevant due to the passage of time. </p><p>2) Minor Public Order Offences: </p><p>The following convictions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 will not be disclosed if the offence is over 7 years old even where more recent offences have been committed:</p><p>- Section 4 (Intoxication), </p><p>- Section 5 (Disorderly conduct), </p><p>- Section 6 (Threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour), </p><p>- Section 7 (Distribution or display of material which is offensive),</p><p>- Section 8 (Failure to comply with direction of Garda), </p><p>- Section 9 (Wilful obstruction).  </p><p>3) Other minor offences &ndash; 1 Only:</p><p>District Court convictions for any other minor offence will not be disclosed after 7 years where the person has one such offence only (excluding motoring or public  order offences over 7 years old). This provision does not apply to offences against the person or to sexual offences.</p><p><b>C. Probation Act Provisions</b></p><p>Where persons have been dealt with by a district court in accordance with the provisions of section 1(1)(i) or 1(1)(ii) of the Probation Act 1907, the offences will not be disclosed except in cases where the circumstances of the offence gives rise to a bona fide concern that the person concerned may harm a child or vulnerable person.</p><p>Where persons have been dealt with by a court in accordance with section 1 (2) of the Probation Act, these will be disclosed in all cases. (Section 1 (2) relates solely to persons &ldquo;convicted on indictment&rdquo;.) </p><p><b>D. Offences in respect of which a person is charged but subsequently not prosecuted or acquitted. </b></p><p>Non convictions will be considered for disclosure where the circumstances of an offence gives rise to a bona fide concern that the person concerned may harm a child or vulnerable person. This information will only be disclosed if the information is of such a nature that its disclosure is necessary, proportionate and reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of children or vulnerable persons, or both, as the case may be.</p><p>The Garda Central Vetting Unit will make such decision in the context of:</p><p>- The information concerned</p><p>- The relevance of the information to the type of work/activity</p><p>- The source and reliability of the information</p><p>- The rights of the vetting applicant and any submissions made by them.</p><p>Where the GCVU makes a determination to disclose information under this section  the GCVU will:</p><p>- Notify the person who is the subject of the application for the vetting disclosure concerned, in writing, of its determination and of the reasons for it,</p><p>- Provide to the person a copy of the information to be disclosed,</p><p>- Notify the  person of the intention to disclose the information to an Authorised Signatory for the registered organisation concerned after the expiry of 14 days from the date of notification, and</p><p>- Allow the applicant the opportunity to make a written submission.</p><p>- There will also be an appeals process in respect of a decision to disclose the information. </p><p>The GCVU will not issue a vetting disclosure in respect of a person until this process has been completed.</p></reply>

The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department does not issue Deportation Orders to unaccompanied minors.</p>  <p>  In enforcing the law in respect of deportations, Ireland is no different to other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory. Ireland, like other EU member states, uses deportation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as the policy of last resort. The process leading to a deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders. It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.</p>  <p>  In order to provide a more complete picture of the situation regarding the removal of non-Irish nationals minors during the period in question, it should be noted that during the same period there were no Removal Orders effected in respect of EU National minors and that 4 Transfer Orders were effected in respect of minors under the Dublin Regulation. Minors are not refused leave to land in the State at ports of entry. However, the parents of accompanied minors can be refused leave to land and the accompanied minors are returned with their parents to the country they arrived from.

No. 525 of 2014) provide for the detailed arrangements to apply in the State where the application of the Dublin III Regulation arises.  This includes the interviewing of each applicant at first instance by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the right to appeal a transfer decision to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal with the transfer suspended pending the outcome of the appeal.  As these Regulations provide for more safeguards for applicants this has resulted in longer processing times for such cases. In addition, the enforcement of a transfer decision once issued may be impeded by the applicant's evasion.</p>  <p>  There has been one Transfer Decision completed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in respect of Italy and none for Spain and Malta since December 2014.  As would be expected, due to geographical and other reasons, the majority of transfer decisions completed by ORAC under the Dublin III Regulation are in respect of the United Kingdom and in that regard a total of 4 individuals have been returned to the United Kingdom under the Dublin Regulation since the beginning of 2015.</p>  <p>  In order to provide a more complete picture of the situation regarding the expulsion of non-Irish nationals from the State, it should be noted that, in addition, since the start of this year to the end of April, 30 Deportation Orders have been effected, 13 Removal Orders have been effected in respect of EU nationals and 909 persons have been refused leave to land in the State at ports of entry.</p></reply>

Under the 2009 Act, authorisations for surveillance are granted by a judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners or the Defence Forces in circumstances which are set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  The Act provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a member of the Defence Forces or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners shall carry out surveillance only in accordance with a valid authorisation. In that regard an application for a valid authorisation must be made by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a judge of the District Court where the officer is of the view that:</p>  <p>(a) as part of an operation or investigation being conducted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning an arrestable offence, the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purposes of obtaining information as to whether the offence has been committed or as to the circumstances relating to the commission of the offence, or obtaining evidence for the purposes of proceedings in relation to the offence,</p>  <p>(b) the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purpose of preventing the commission of arrestable offences, or</p>  <p>(c) the surveillance being sought to be authorised is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the security of the State.</p>  <p>  Exceptionally, in accordance with Section 7 of the Act, an approval may be granted without recourse to the District Court in very limited circumstances as set out in the Act where grounds of urgency exist. An approval may also be granted in accordance with Section 8 where tracking devices are to be used. The approval for the use of a tracking device is limited to providing information on the location of a person, vehicle or thing. </p>  <p>  In this regard the Designated Judge appointed to oversee the operation of the Act under Section 12 has noted, in his most recent report to the Taoiseach, that he was satisfied that applications under section 7 of the Act were properly made and that, where approvals were granted under section 8, that appropriate consideration had been given to the proportionality of the actions for which approval was sought. He was also satisfied that the provisions of the Act had been complied with in all respects.  </p>  <p>  I should also add that in the performance of his statutory role, the Designated Judge has unimpeded access to all documentation and personnel relevant to this legislation.</p>  <p>  He commented favourably on his experiences in his dealings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and concluded that it was evident from the files inspected that the use of such devices has been of great assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the detection and prosecution of offences and in the monitoring of persons suspected of being involved in  activities which could threaten the security of the State.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that in addition to independent judicial oversight by a designated Judge of the High Court, a complaints mechanism is provided for in the legislation whereby any individual who believes that they have been the victim of improper use of the legislation may have their complaint investigated by an independent Complaints Referee.</p></reply>

The General Scheme includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation.  In addition, the Bill will provide for new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.</p>  <p>  The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence.</p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.</p>  <p>  The Bill is priority legislation and is currently being drafted, with a view to publication in this parliamentary session.</p></reply>

The remaining 100 entered the college in early February.  This brought  to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College and is a measure of the Government's commitment to ensure that recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues seamlessly.  The September intake attested as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 23 April 2015 and the December intake will attest in Summer 2015.

Similarly, investments are being made in vehicles and IT, and in the recruitment of specialist professional staff.  Policing and community safety in Kildare will undoubtedly benefit from this injection of resources, as it will in all other Garda Divisions.</p>  <p>  With regard to vehicles and communication links within the Kildare Division, the information requested by the Deputy is being processed and I will shortly write to the Deputy directly on this matter. </p></reply>

The Commission indicated that they will be recommending an EU resettlement scheme by the end of May for 20,000 places.  This number will be distributed among Member States in accordance with several clearly defined criteria (Ireland&rsquo;s proposed share will be 1.36% or 272 persons).  Participation would be voluntary, given that there are no existing powers under EU law to compel Member States to participate in such schemes, but; depending on the approach adopted by Member States the Commission may bring forward binding and mandatory legislative proposals to cover the period beyond 2016.</p>  <p>  In line with our regular commitment on resettlement, Ireland had already agreed to resettle 220 refugees over the next two years.  However the Government has agreed in principle to resettle an additional 300 vulnerable people as our contribution to this important European initiative.  This brings our total commitment on resettlement to the end of 2016 to five hundred and twenty (520) people, or nearly twice the quota proposed by the Commission for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Relocation is a more complicated issue and there are different perspectives among Member States.  To deal with the situation in the Mediterranean the Commission is now proposing to trigger the emergency response mechanism under Article 78.3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU via a proposal to be published by the end of May 2015.  This proposal will include a distribution mechanism for persons in clear need of international protection.  Such persons would have their asylum claim considered in the receiving Member State.  However no details are available as to what the Commission plan would actually entail and until we have more information it would be premature for me to comment  further at this point.</p>  <p>  I would refer the Deputy also to my reply to Question Number 114 answered today which goes into the situation in the Mediterranean in more depth. </p></reply>

Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 123 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.  VAT exemptions for fees in family law cases are not under consideration.</p><p>Under the Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, backed up, for the first time in legislation, by a set of Legal Costs Principles and published legal costs determinations. The Bill will also pave the way for the introduction of new business structures combining legal and other service providers so that they can combine to meet the needs of consumers in a more cost-effective way. In England and Wales, for example, greater cost transparency has been achieved and savings have been made by consumers in specific areas of family law since the introduction of these new legal business models. </p><p>In addition to these legal services and costs reforms there are other family litigation supports which deserve mention. The Deputy will wish to know that family law proceedings are, in fact, exempt from the payment of court fees.  In terms of assisting those engaged in family law litigation who are most in need, it must also be recognised that family law continues to constitute the predominant area where the Legal Aid Board provides legal services. Of the cases handled by the Board in 2013, 85 per cent, that is to say 12,936 cases, were in the family law area. Moreover, since 2011, the Board also has responsibility for the Family Mediation Service, which is staffed by professionally trained and accredited mediators through a network of full- and part-time offices around the country.The service is currently free.</p><p>In general, as set out in Section 29(1)(b) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, clients being provided with legal aid make a payment before they see a solicitor (an advice contribution) and a further payment before their solicitor represents them in court (an aid contribution). The amount of the payment is based on the person&rsquo;s disposable income and, where their capital assets (excluding their family home) exceed &euro;4,000, their disposable capital also. The minimum contribution is usually &euro;30 for legal advice and &euro;130 for legal aid. Most of the applicants for the Board&rsquo;s services pay these minimum contributions. The service which the Board provides is a full service involving advice, representation (including in certain cases the services of legal counsel), implementation and enforcement. It should be noted that VAT is not paid on contributions.</p><p>In respect of the rare cases in which the contribution might be significant, section 28(4)(c) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 specifically allows the Board to refuse legal aid where the contribution is likely to exceed the amount of fees which an applicant might be charged if he/she went to a private solicitor. In practice this provision has only rarely been applied as the costs of privately delivered services usually will exceed any contribution which might be charged.</p><p>In replying to the Deputy, I also understand that persons who apply for legal services to defend proceedings brought by the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) to take children into state care or to supervise them in their own homes do not pay a contribution towards legal services. In addition, section 29(2)(b) of the Act provides that the Board can waive any contribution due, or accept a lower contribution, in cases where failure to do so would cause undue hardship to the applicant. In most family law cases involving persons who are in receipt of legal aid the usual practice is for the Court to make no order as to costs at the end of the case. This means that each party pays their own costs. In the unusual event that costs are awarded against the other party the Board is required to seek to recover its costs from the costs awarded and the person in receipt of legal aid is under an obligation to assist the Board in doing this.</p><p>Provision is also made under section 33(7) of the 1995 Act which can mean that if a person recovers any settlement monies these must be paid into the Legal Aid Fund. This is to enable the Board to recover the costs of providing the service to the legally aided person. If any property other than the person&rsquo;s home is recovered or preserved it is subject to a charge in favour of the Legal Aid Fund. The Board will generally cap the solicitor&rsquo;s fees element of any costs recovered from a person receiving legal aid in judicial separation and divorce cases at &euro;5,000. It will not recover its costs from newly awarded maintenance, nor from maintenance arrears where the amount recovered is less than &euro;3174.35. Section 33(8) of the Act provides that the Board can waive any money or property it is due under section 33(7) if not to do so would cause hardship.</p></reply>

This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules, 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her.  There were 15 prisoners under the age of 21 who had their regime restricted for this reason. </p><p>In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules, 2007.  There were 2 prisoners under the age of 21 who had their regime restricted for this reason.  There were also 2 prisoners with restricted regimes for discipline reasons (Rule 67). </p><p>In July 2013, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service established a high level group to look at measures which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners currently held on restricted regimes with a view to ensuring that all receive, as a minimum standard, out of cell time of 3 hours per day to engage in exercise or activity.  Since April 2015, prison governors have implemented individual case management plans for all prisoners who are accommodated on a 22 or 23 hour lock up regime. </p><p><b>Table 1 - Total number of prisoners under 21 years of age in custody.</b><table><tr><th>Prison/Place of Detention</th><th>17 yrs</th><th>18 yrs</th><th>19 yrs</th><th>20 yrs</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Castlerea Prison</td><td>0 </td><td>1</td><td>13</td><td>15</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill Remand Prison</td><td>0 </td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>12</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Prison</td><td>0 </td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick Prison (F)</td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>2</td><td>0 </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick Prison (M)</td><td>0 </td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>0 </td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands Prison</td><td>0 </td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy Prison (F)</td><td>0 </td><td>2</td><td>0 </td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy Prison (M) </td><td>0 </td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise Prison</td><td>0 </td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>0 </td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>St. Patrick's Institution</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0 </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>28</td><td>22</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>10</td><td>37</td><td>74</td><td>91</td><td>212</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2 - Age of prisoners under 21 years of age on restricted regimes.</b><table><tr><th>Age</th><th>Number of Prisoners.</th></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>19</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3 - Breakdown of restricted regime for prisoners under 21 years of age.</b><table><tr><th>Regime</th><th>Number of Prisoners</th></tr><tr><td>19 Hours</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>20 Hours</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>21 Hours</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>22 Hours</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>23 Hours</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>19</td></tr></table></p></reply>

While it is the case that a shortfall in staffing numbers on a particular day can impact negatively on service provision, the Irish Prison Service is actively pursuing the option of having all libraries in prisons managed by long-term, suitably trained prisoners, with professional oversight in order to maximise the service.  Prisoners have been trained up and are active in supporting library services in Arbour Hill, the Midlands Prison, Training Unit, Castlerea Prison, Limerick, Portlaoise, Mountjoy, Wheatfield and the D&oacute;chas Centre.

These functions are provided from the Burgh Quay offices in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  The office also provides a range of other immigration related services with approximately 130,000 people per annum attending in person at the office.  These include applications for re-entry visas administered by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department which are issued to visa-required nationals resident in Ireland to ensure they can return to this State after leaving the jurisdiction for visit purposes.  This office is probably one of the busiest Public Offices with some of the longest opening times in the State.  </p><p>The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to five-hundred people who attend at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at this registration office, to ensure that those attending are dealt with on a 'first come first served' basis.  In addition those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return at the appropriate time if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.  Specific times are set aside for certain categories of persons such as students.  Indeed, for the peak student period in autumn last year the office opened on Saturdays.  Tickets are not issued to non-nationals whose registration relates to their presence in Ireland for study related purposes until after 9am so as to facilitate those non-nationals whose permission to reside in the State is work related.  </p><p>In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an announcement  is posted on the Garda Website alerting customers to the number of available tickets remaining at the Burgh Quay public office for that day.</p><p>It is a requirement of the registration function that persons seeking to register present in person to their local registration office.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  The registration process includes an interview with the person, the examination of relevant documentation, photographing and biometric capture and the issuing of a registration certificate.  It also includes the placing of the appropriate permission to remain endorsement on the passport of the person concerned.  It should also be noted that for most persons, renewal of their registration is at most a yearly requirement and that for the majority of customers the GNIB provides a <i>'</i>same day service<i></i>at its Burgh Quay office.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a major reform of the delivery of immigration services is underway including the transfer of registration functions from the GNIB to the INIS.  This presents opportunities to streamline both registration and visa re-entry services and INIS is working on introducing on-line services as part of this process including a booking system for appointments.</p></reply>

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  </p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of organised crime. </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not.     </p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  </p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.  </p>  <p>  At international level, the question of how best to deal with participation in and/or directing a criminal organisation through the criminal law has been the subject of debate in the development of common international standards.  Relevant international instruments to which Ireland is a party are the European Union Council Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA  on the fight against organised crime and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.</p>  <p>  Ireland has given effect to these instruments through domestic criminal law including the legislation outlined above.</p></reply>

The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.

Training and education activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release and also to help prisoners cope with their sentences.  A priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years.

There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  </p>  <p>  Placements in prison are made having considered the safety of prisoners and the maintenance of good order and security in the prison. Irrespective as to whether a prisoner is a first time offender, a gang affiliated prisoner or part of the general prisoner population, prison management assess the needs of prisoners and refer them to the appropriate services.  The manner in which records are collated does not allow the Irish Prison Service to differentiate between first-time offenders and gang affiliations. </p>  <p>  Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the Education Training Boards and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.  The partnership endeavours to meet the needs of students through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.  A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University.  There is an increasing focus on FETAC accreditation as the modular structure best meets the needs of students in prison.</p></reply>

This case management is undertaken by Probation Officers in the community for the duration of the specified community sanction. </p>  <p>  Newly committed prisoners with a sentence of greater than one year are eligible to take part in Integrated Sentence Management (ISM).  This involves a specific orientation in the delivery of all rehabilitative prison-based services to prisoners and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services while in prison.  The end result is a prisoner-centred, multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress. </p>  <p>  The guiding principle which underpins education and work and training services in prisons is to make available, work, work-training, education and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Training and education activities endeavour to meet the needs of prisoners through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.</p>  <p>  A primary function of the Psychology Service in prisons is to assist offenders address factors that place them at risk of re-offending including inter alia; anger issues, substance abuse, sexual and violent offending.  The service delivers the Building Better Lives programme for sex offenders in Arbour Hill and a similar programme for violent offenders in Wheatfield Place of Detention.  The Irish Prison Service continue to ensure that all appropriate efforts are made to work with sex offenders to ensure the risk of re- offending after release is reduced to the greatest extent possible and that they are supported in reintegrating into the community.  A Joint Irish Prison Service/Probation Service working group has been established to review sex offenders' risk and offence related issues.</p>  <p>  Local review meetings are held in prisons on a monthly basis where prisoners' sentence progression are discussed.  These meetings facilitate the exchange of information and aid decision making with respect to the management of prisoners' sentences.  They are chaired by the Governor with the attendance of senior prison management, Probation staff, Chaplains, Teachers, other prison staff and an official from the Prisons Service Headquarters.  Part of the discussions cover the risk of re-offending on release and the risk of failing to comply with temporary release conditions are discussed, generally in the case of prisoners being assessed for early release.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that a new pre-release planning policy for the Irish Prison Service is at an advanced stage and will represent considerable improvements to current pre-release planning and practices in Irish prisons.  This policy will address issues arising for the individual in custody under six key pillars: Housing/Accommodation Needs, Financial Supports, Healthcare, Public Safety and Statutory Requirements, Families &amp;amp; Personal Relationships, Education, Training and Employment. </p>  <p>  A new central information window on the electronic Prisoner Information Management System (PIMS) is under development to support this policy.  This new window will record a range of information with regard to post-release concerns and sentence plans for individual prisoners.  It is the aim of the Irish Prison Service that all releases from Irish prisons and places of detention are planned releases to ensure the informed and effective transition of the offender from prison to the community, in compliance with statutory, legal and sentencing provisions.</p></reply>

Consequently, recruitment across the justice sector remained subject to specific sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Recruitment by way of sanctioned exception to the moratorium was therefore restricted to specific or priority posts.  In that context the following recruitment took place during 2014:<table><tr><th>Department/Section</th><th>Numbers Recruited</th></tr><tr><td>Department (Including Irish Prison Service &amp;amp; Probation Service)</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Courts Service</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>National Disability Authority</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Legal Aid Board</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td><td>204</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that a number of the posts filled related to posts vacated by retiring staff members or staff who otherwise left their posts including by way of transfers or promotions.  Furthermore, 76 of the posts shown above relate to temporary clerical officers employed on short term contracts.  These are, by definition, short term contracts designed principally to meet seasonal peaks and facilitate staff who avail of the Shorter Working Year Scheme. </p><p>In addition to the above a number of staff joined the Department on transfer or through redeployment from other areas of the Civil and Public Service.  </p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is an independent statutory body, established under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, 2014 with effect from 1 November 2014.  In order to facilitate the establishment of the Commission from that date, recruitment to a number of posts by the then Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission was undertaken and the table below reflects recruitment in 2014 prior to the establishment date of 1 November 2014.<table><tr><td>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission</td><td>5</td></tr></table></p><p>The numbers of civil and public servants from my Department or Agencies under the aegis of my Department who were seconded out or abroad during 2014 is set out in the table.<table><tr><th>Department/Section</th><th>Numbers Seconded</th></tr><tr><td>Department (Including Irish Prison Service &amp;amp; Probation Service)</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Property Registration Authority</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Courts Service</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Legal Aid Board</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td><td>55</td></tr></table></p><p>The following public servants under the aegis of my Department retired during the year 2014:<table><tr><th>Department/Section</th><th>Number of Retirees</th></tr><tr><td>Legal Aid Board</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td><td>249</td></tr></table></p><p>The information in relation to civil service retirements is being provided on a centralised basis by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The Justice Sector continues to have a total staff strength of 22,000 approximately and notwithstanding the continuation of the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in 2014, I was delighted to have recently secured sanctions to recruit significant numbers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to specific areas or roles such as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Charities Regulatory Authority and also to the Border Management Unit of my Department to facilitate operating frontline immigration controls at Dublin Airport by civilians.  I will continue to prioritise frontline service delivery.</p></reply>

Membership of the Group includes representation from right across Government, including the Departments of Education and Skills, Jobs and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and as well as the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and An Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Group has held a series of bilateral discussions with relevant Government Departments, including the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills, Finance, Jobs and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  To inform its work, the Group has already solicited the views of key stakeholders, interested parties and the general public through a number of consultative processes, including an Open Policy Debate on Future Investment in Early Years and School-Age Care and Education Services, which was hosted by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on 31st March 2015 and attended by some 40 invited representatives including parents, providers, academics, childcare committees, and NGOs.</p>  <p>  Two separate online consultation processes - one with the early years sector and one with parents and guardians - have also taken place and the approximately 400 submissions received from the early years sector and almost 1,000 submissions received from parents and guardians are currently being analysed.</p>  <p>  The question of tax relief or tax credits as a means of supporting working parents was looked at previously but was considered to be unsuitable for a number of reasons.  For example, the introduction of tax credits would not help to support quality improvements within the childcare sector and would not help those families on low pay who may not have any tax liability. There is also concern that the application of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents.</p>  <p>  I am determined that all spending, whether existing or additional, will be based on good evidence, and co-ordinated strategically, so that we achieve the best possible benefits for children.  It is for this reason that I established the Inter-Departmental Group which will look at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context. The Group will submit its report to Government by end June 2015.</p></reply>

The organisation is funded by Tusla up to the end of June 2015.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres are front-line services rooted in the community they serve.  They offer an open door and respectful service.  This universal accessibility allows for early identification of need, provision of appropriate interventions and timely referrals to appropriate services and for more intensive and targeted work as required.  Acting as a focal point within their community, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families.  This is inclusive of children and families who may have a disability.</p>  <p>  Tusla values the work of DESSA and recognises the impact of its work across the Family Resource Centre Programme.  I am assured by Tusla that the existing Family Resource Centre network has the capacity to deliver the services in question and to the required level.  Tusla intends to build on the significant strengths of Family Resource Centres in meeting its mandate for community-based early intervention and family support.  In this regard, Tusla is providing funding of &euro;13.09m to 109 Centres across the country in 2015.</p>  <p>  In seeking to improve outcomes and well being for children and young people, Tusla must ensure that it makes the most efficient use of its resources and in a way that is efficient, equitable, proportionate and sustainable. Tusla is giving particular priority in 2015 to the protection of front-line services and those which are best aligned to the priority outcomes as set out in the Agency's Corporate Plan.</p>  <p>  Tusla is in receipt of Exchequer funding of &euro;643m in 2015 which represents an increase of &euro;34m or 5.6% over 2014. The level of funding provided represents tangible evidence of this Government's commitment to improving services for the most disadvantaged children and families.</p></reply>

In September 2014 officials from my Department and the Child and Family Agency met with the National Carers' Association to discuss the role of the Department and the Agency in relation to the National Carers' Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 brings together a range of existing services for children and families to one agency.  The Child and Family Agency is responsible for the former Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and also for the functions of Child and Family services previously provided by the HSE.  The Agency's functions include maintaining and developing services in order to support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children and to support effective functioning of families. In so doing the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation to ensure that services are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015/16 academic year. The Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its service strands.</p>  <p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles.</p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy is also being developed by my Department for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support. I am pleased that representatives of the Carers' Association participated in the consultation process in the development of this strategy.</p></reply>

Tusla has asked Chairpersons of Local Management Committees to prepare their school retention plans for the 2015/2016 school year based on the expenditure allocated last year and to return them to the Agency by June 5th. Following receipt of these plans, all school completion projects including those in Co.

These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.</p>  <p>  On the specific issues raised by the Deputy, the Department of Health has informed my Department that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Improving access to the pre-school year for children with special needs is a priority for my Department.</p>  <p>  The intersectoral work done under the chairmanship of the Office of the Minister for Disability and Mental Health and through the Cross Sectoral Team on children&rsquo;s disability issues agreed that the best approach to meeting the needs of children with a disability of pre-school age was through mainstream pre-school services, but no agreement was reached on what the model of provision would be, or, who would lead out on developing this.</p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department has recently agreed with his counterparts in the Departments of Health and Education and Skills that my Department will seek to gain agreement, in a relatively short time-frame, between the three sectors (children, education, health) on the most appropriate, workable model for supports to pre-school children with special needs. This will be followed by very close co-operation between the sectors in defining/developing the model and in making an agreed cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required to implement it. The team will use information from recent consultations with parents and providers to inform their work and will conduct further consultation as the tight time-frame allows.</p>  <p>  There will be several challenges to agreeing an appropriate and workable model &ndash; including reviewing existing resources in the system to determine how they can best meet children&rsquo;s&rsquo; needs, and accessing the additional investment needed. My Department has committed to leading this process and it is my intention that a proposal will be available in time for the Estimates process.</p></reply>

Of these, nearly 93% are in foster care, either with relatives or a general foster placement.  Of all children in care, over 92% (5,878) have an allocated social worker and 90% (5,739) have an up to date written care plan.  This indicates that 515 children in care are without a dedicated social worker and that there were 654 who did not have an updated care plan.</p>  <p>  The policy in place and utilised by Tusla states that all children coming into care, and those in high risk placements, have an allocated social worker.  Maternity leave, vacancies and competing priorities all contribute to gaps in staffing, which can cause strain on the allocation of social workers.  I would note that figures provided by Tusla for children with a written care plan only include care plans that have formally completed the review process required under the Child Care Regulations 1995.  Where a review is taking place, the existing care plan remains in place.</p>  <p>  According to Tusla policy, where a child is awaiting the allocation of a social worker, they are responded to by a duty team on a risk management basis for any change in circumstances.  During this time, specific pieces of work on the child's case may be undertaken by staff working in the duty system. Also, structures are in place to regulate and inspect service provision, including the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority.

Programmes for life skills can be provided if this is one of the assessed needs of the child who is preparing to leave care.</p>  <p>  Aftercare workers are provided both by Tusla as well as through services that are commissioned from community, voluntary and private organisations.  Funding is also made available to support a person who is to remain on with their foster family as part of their aftercare plan.

I understand that Tusla provides age appropriate information for young people preparing to leave care, and has plans for further accessible information on diet, money management and other basic life skills.</p>  <p>  The Government has decided to amend the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.

Some 30 national and major regional youth services receive funding under the Youth Services Grants Scheme.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres Scheme. The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2015, an allocation of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department to support the provision of youth services.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have available to it, funding for the summer project initiative detailed by the Deputy. The project may be eligible for funding under the Summer Project Grant Scheme operated by the City of Dublin Youth Services Board. Under the scheme, grants are awarded towards the cost of educational programmes and activities in locally organised summer projects in the Dublin City area.

The Government decided that the preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.  The Health (Transport Supports) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for 2015.  On foot of a Government decision, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed, on the basis that this would prevent hardship and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p></reply>

An action area within that objective is to ensure that carers' needs are considered in the development of any policies that might affect them (such as the Review of Disability Policy, the National Positive Ageing Strategy, and the Children and Young People's Policy Framework 2012-2017.</p><p>The needs of those who care for people with disabilities have been taken into account in the development of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services and related policy documents and will continue to be taken into account during implementation of the Review&rsquo;s recommendations. Consultation with stakeholders, including carers, was a key element of the development of these policy initiatives, and this will continue to be the case. For example, carers were included in recent consultations on draft interim day service standards for people with disabilities which are nearing finalisation. Families and carers are also an integral part of the consultation and planning process for the transition of people living in congregated settings to community living. The provision of respite services is a vital part of the continuum of services which the HSE provides to support the families of people with disabilities. This year 5,274 people with a disability are expected to avail of residential centre-based respite services, utilising 190,003 bed nights, and increasing use is being made of newer and more innovative forms of non-centre-based respite services.</p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy notes that 80% of the main caregivers to people over the age of 50 are themselves aged 50 or over and approximately 20% of these are over 65. It states that Ireland's ageing population, coupled with medical advances in relation to disability and chronic illness, will result in more older people being cared for in the community in the years ahead. Under National Goal 2 of the Strategy which is to support people as they age to maintain, improve or manage their physical and mental health and wellbeing, Objective 2.3 explicitly stresses the need to recognise and support the role of carers by implementing the National Carers' Strategy.</p><p>The vital role of carers is also explicitly acknowledged in the recently published National Dementia Strategy (2014) which states that carers are the cornerstone of care for people with dementia living in the community. Carers' needs are accordingly prioritised throughout the Strategy. Section 6 of the Strategy focuses on integrated services, supports and care for people with dementia and their carers, and a number of the priority actions relate to the supports that need to be available both to people with dementia and to their carers to enable them to continue in their caring role. These include home care packages, respite care and access to information on available services and supports. The HSE has set up a National Dementia Strategy Implementation Office to bring forward implementation of the Strategy.</p><p>The needs of young carers are recognised in the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020 <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures</i>in light of the potential vulnerability of children and young people with caring responsibilities.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has recently engaged with the Carer's Association in the development of the draft National Youth Strategy.</p></reply>

An action area within that objective is to promote more proactive approaches to the identification of carers and to addressing their needs among staff and organisations that are likely to encounter individuals in caring situations (e.g. health and personal social service providers, and particularly primary care team members, community and education professionals).</p><p>Within the Community Health Organisations (CHO) arrangements for care needs assessments are made as appropriate through the multi disciplinary primary care teams, public health nursing service, multi disciplinary (hospital &amp;amp; community) home care committees, and local placement fora (for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme).  Input from a carer as appropriate i.e. with the service user&rsquo;s permission; is integral to ensure that both informal and formal care is taken into account to ensure a holistic care package is developed.</p><p>In March 2014 the HSE launched &lsquo;<b>The Integrated Care Guidance: A practical guide to discharge and transfer from hospital&rsquo;.  </b>Within the guide there are 9 steps for effective discharge planning and transfer from hospital to community healthcare settings. These include steps which specifically outlines the involvement of the service user and carers so they can make informed decisions and choices for future care.</p><p>In parallel to the on going work with the Single Assessment Tool, the HSE working with Irish Carers organisations and interRAI have finalised a draft Carers Need Assessment questionnaire. The draft is being further refined by interRAI and it is hoped to conduct a pilot in Ireland followed by a larger international field trial. This is a significant development for the HSE and carers.</p><p>The HSE has established a cross-divisional working group to examine all of the health related actions in the Strategy and this will include actions promoting more proactive identification of carers and their role in care planning subject to the consent of the service user.</p><p>With regard to education professionals, the Department of Education &amp;amp; Science actively participates in and supports the National Carers Strategy and is cognisant of the needs of the broad range of needs of carers within the education system be they parents or guardians of students therein or students with caring responsibilities themselves.</p><p>A core aim of DES policy in the school system is to provide a safe supportive and vigilant environment in which pupil learning and personal development can be nurtured. The core focus in this regard is, on the one hand, the promotion of positive mental health generally and, on the other, the identification and support of those pupils with a broad range of problems relating to their behavioural, emotional and social development. Supports are delivered via curricular programmes (SPHE, PE, etc), whole school policies (anti-bullying, R.S.E., substance misuse, etc) and by direct intervention through the class teacher, guidance counsellor, pastoral care structure assisted by a range of outside agents, including those within the education community.</p><p>Engagement with carers, especially carers of pupils with special educational, social or emotional needs, by the range of educational professionals is welcomed and encouraged relating to policy formulation, consent, advice, guidance, intervention and in some situations onward referral to other services.</p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government supports the Community and Voluntary Sector in its contribution to an active, democratic and pluralist society, including the role of carers and the support they provide.</p><p>The funding Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary sector along with the associated Bridging Funding Scheme provides multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services. (Among the organisations funded through these mechanisms are The Care Alliance, Caring for Carers Ireland and The Carers Association).</p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government also manages the Seniors Alert Scheme, which encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities by providing grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.

Input from a carer (with the service user&rsquo;s permission), is integral to ensure that both informal and formal care is taken into account to ensure a holistic care package is developed.</p><p>In addition, in March 2014 the HSE launched &lsquo;<b>The Integrated Care Guidance: A practical guide to discharge and transfer from hospital&rsquo;.  </b>Within the guide there are 9 steps for effective discharge planning and transfer from hospital to community healthcare settings. These include steps which specifically outline the involvement of the service user and carers so they can make informed decisions and choices for future care.</p><p>The HSE established a cross-divisional working group to examine and progress all of the health related actions in the Strategy, which will include the actions regarding the involvement of carers with health professionals in the development of care plans.</p></reply>

NOSP has developed a range of initiatives to support people who are suicidal and also supporting their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts. It has progressed substantial work on almost every recommendation of <i>Reach Out,</i>and funds over 40 individual organisations and programmes, both internal and external to the HSE.</p><p><i>Reach Out</i>came to the end of its 10-year term at the end of 2014 and consequently the Department of Health and the HSE have been developing a new strategic framework for suicide prevention for the period 2015-2020, building on the comprehensive work delivered under <i>Reach Out.</i>The new strategy is focused on a whole-of-government approach, including engagement with several other Government departments, and sets out a comprehensive and multi-layered response, with interventions at different levels, and involving a range of stakeholders. It provides a set of strategic goals, objectives, related actions and high-level outcomes to progress suicide prevention over the next five years. Each area of action is led by a Government department or agency, working closely with communities and non-statutory partners. An implementation plan will be developed which will identify clear roles and responsibilities, robust monitoring and accountability structures to support and drive action across all stakeholder organisations.</p><p>Work on finalising the new National Strategic Framework is at an advanced stage. Subject to Government approval, the Framework should be completed and published by end-June 2015. The publication of the new Framework will present opportunities for further cooperation on suicide prevention initiatives in the areas of research, evaluation, raising awareness, promoting positive mental health, shared learning and good practice.  The new Framework includes a number of actions and outcomes which I hope will help us achieve our goal of fewer lives lost through suicide.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year).  The transition to this new service model is taking place on a phased basis and includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, including service users and their families.</p><p>My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in respect of the detailed operational issues that she has raised.

This data was examined in conjunction with all the other data collated by the CMO.</p>  <p>  This data, together with the conclusions and recommendations, are set out clearly in the CMO's Report into the HSE Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise Perinatal Deaths (2006-date) February, 2014.  </p>  <p>  Overall the CMO concluded that using the available data including in relation to claims on an ongoing basis is a straightforward and useful way for maternity units to monitor trends, so areas of possible concern for the service can be identified early and actions take as required.  It is for this reason that the CMO recommended that the HSE should ensure that every maternity service (and later every health provider) be required to complete a Patient Safety Statement which is published and updated monthly.

This echoes the findings of the CMO's Report into perinatal deaths in Portlaoise published in February 2014.  To address this, HIQA has made the following recommendation in its Report:</p><p>&quot;<i>The Health Service Executive (HSE), the chief executive officer of each hospital group and the State Claims Agency must immediately develop, agree and implement a memorandum of understanding between each party to ensure the timely sharing of actual and potential clinical risk information, analysis and trending data. This information must be used to inform national and hospital-group patient safety strategies.&quot;</i></p><p>Work is ongoing between the State Claims Agency and the HSE to optimise the use of the data provided on clinical incidents (including Serious Reportable Events) by the HSE using the National Incident Management System in order to analyse trends and minimise risk in a timely fashion.  The process for sharing this data will be agreed as quickly as possible in a Memorandum of Understanding between the relevant parties, as recommended by HIQA.</p><p>The HIQA Report also called for the establishment of an oversight group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report.  The Minister has approved the composition and terms of reference of this Group. </p><p>The Minister has also written to the Director General of the HSE to request the HSE to submit a plan and timetable to implement the HIQA recommendations.  This plan will be used by the Oversight Group to monitor the HSE's progress on implementation.  A named person in the HSE will have responsibility for reporting on behalf of the Directorate to the Oversight Group each month on progress in implementing the recommendations.</p></reply>

The Government has commenced this process in respect of all children under 6 years. The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was enacted on 25th July 2014. </p>  <p>  Agreement has been reached between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation on terms for the delivery of GP care without fees for all children aged under 6.  Under the new arrangements, an additional 270,000 children under 6 will benefit from GP care free at the point of service.  All children under 6 will benefit from the new enhanced service under the proposed GP contract. </p>  <p>  This will involve age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and the prevention of disease.  These assessments will be carried out when a child is aged 2 and again at age 5.  The contract will also cover an agreed cycle of care for children diagnosed with asthma, under which GPs will carry out an annual review of each child where the doctor has diagnosed asthma.</p>  <p>  In parallel with this, GP care without fees will be extended to all persons aged 70 years and over, subject to the passing of the necessary legislation.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2015, which was published on 25 March 2015, will provide the statutory basis for the over-70s universal GP service.  This service will benefit about 36,000 people and will be provided under the existing GMS contract. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises that different age-groups have different healthcare needs and ability to access services and that children and older people have particular needs in this regard.  For many years we have had universal eligibility for acute hospital services but the first and most effective point of contact with the health service which is provided by GP's has only been provided on a public basis to those on very low incomes. </p>  <p>  The provision of universal GP access through greater public investment in primary care services is a critical reform in resolving inequities and re-balancing our services towards earlier prevention.  The introduction of universal GP access for the youngest and oldest members of our community is an important step in the phased implementation of these reforms.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria  including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. They are not political or Ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. </p>  <p>   In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. </p>  <p>  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. </p>  <p>  It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014.  The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering and these engagements have been completed.  It is not possible to say when a decision on the funding of this medication will be made as the HSE is considering the outcome of those commercial engagements as well as the outcome of discussions which the HSE has had with clinical experts regarding this drug.</p></reply>

This report recommended the establishment of seven Hospital Groups which have now been set up on a non-statutory administrative basis. </p>  <p>  In October 2014, the HSE launched the Community Health care Organisations (CHO) Report. The Report sets out plans for a comprehensive reorganisation of health services outside the acute hospital system into nine CHOs.  The primary focus is to meet the maximum proportion of people's care needs in the communities where they live and to achieve joined-up, integrated services. </p>  <p>  In determining the optimum organisational model for the CHOs, the HSE identified a requirement for integration between the different parts of the community health care services; between community health care services and acute hospitals; with wider public service organisations such as local authorities, the Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the education sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and with local voluntary organisations.</p>  <p>  The option selected was arrived at after consideration of a number of options, details of which are contained in the HSE report on Community Health care Organisations. The option selected was deemed the most appropriate on the basis that it met a key requirement of linking primary care teams and networks with acute hospitals; it provided a strong basis for linkage with local authority boundaries and it struck an appropriate balance between an organisation of sufficiently large scale to support organisation and business capability, while at the same time being of sufficiently small scale to provide the local community connection and response required to deliver integrated care.</p>  <p>  The CHO structures became effective in January 2015. It is envisaged that the principal day-to-day linkages at clinical and patient level will be between the primary care networks and the relevant service within the Hospital Group.  There will also be significant inter-Hospital Group interfaces for certain national services and it is envisaged that individual CHOs will interface with hospitals from more than one Hospital Group. Work to give effect to these interfaces is comprehended by the reform programmes currently underway in the HSE.</p></reply>

Its introduction in 2009 relieved families of potentially very onerous expense and ensured equity of treatment based upon means, regardless of the type of nursing home care provided. The Scheme involves very significant financial commitment on the part of the State with &euro;993m allocated to the Scheme in 2015. This represents an increase of &euro;54m on the 2014 figures. </p>  <p>  There are several important safeguards built into the scheme which ensure that both the person entering long-term nursing home care and their spouse/partner are adequately provided for:</p>  <p>  - Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</p>  <p>  - The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.</p>  <p>  - The principal residence (and farms/businesses in certain circumstances) is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care.</p>  <p>  - Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p>  <p>  - If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will retain 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p>  <p>  - The scheme also provides for certain items of expenditure, 'allowable deductions', to be taken into account during the financial assessment. These include health expenses, levies required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person's principal residence.</p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. This review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche Consultants on specific issues which required specialised expertise. The review is considering the long term sustainability of the Scheme including funding arrangements.  No decisions have been taken nor plans in place regarding changes to the way the Scheme currently operates.</p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, as well as considering how the Scheme has operated to date, is expected to identify some of the broader issues that will need to be considered and tested more fully into the future, including the future financing of the full range of supports for older people, how community and residential supports and services should be balanced, and whether new care approaches can contribute positively. A continuum of more efficient care might serve to reduce the number of people requiring nursing home care and limit the projected increase in the cost of the Scheme.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the actions in the Roadmap for Implementation are those that can be achieved on a cost neutral basis.</p><p>The National Carers' Strategy committed to the production of an Annual Report on progress which would be published on the websites of relevant Departments.  The first Annual Report on implementation of the Strategy was published in November 2013 and the second in January 2015, both of which are available on my Department's website.  These Annual Reports will provide the Deputies with a list of actions that were identified in the Strategy and what progress has been made on each one since the Strategy&rsquo;s publication.</p><p>While The Carers Association's recently published <i>Family Carers Scorecard</i>raises concerns over the pace of implementation, much work has been done and the report acknowledges achievements such as:</p><p>- The development of a single assessment tool for older people containing a detailed Carers Needs Assessment;</p><p>- The imminent release of one million euro funding from Dormant accounts for training and information provision for family carers;</p><p>- The hosting of an Annual Carers Forum by the Department of Social Protection and in particular the positive engagement around the structure of this forum to meet the needs of family carers.</p><p>At my Department's request, the HSE has set up a multi-disciplinary working group to bring forward implementation of the health aspects of the Strategy.</p><p>I am determined that this Strategy will be applied in a way that makes a real and positive difference to the lives of carers, their families, and those that they care for.</p></reply>

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008. However, the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in Budget 2015 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels. The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy, outlining planned pay expenditure and staff numbers.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction will be issued. As this process is still ongoing, the existing moratorium and Employment Control Framework arrangements will continue to apply. However the number of staff employed has already increased by over 900 since January, the majority of whom are frontline staff, including speech therapists. This increase partly reflects the initiative being undertaken by the HSE to reduce reliance on agency and to offer contracts of employment where agency can be replaced by full time posts.  This increase also reflects the continuing capacity of the HSE to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front line services.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the aspect of the question that relates to speech therapists. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

The Strategy is a cross cutting area of public policy and service delivery which requires a co-ordinated approach across many Government Departments and Agencies, in conjunction with the Community and Voluntary sectors to tackling the drugs problem.    </p>  <p>  Prevention and awareness programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem particularly among young persons.  The Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) Programme is the foundation for developing awareness of drug and alcohol issues in schools.  The Department of Health's Drugs Initiative provides almost &euro;4m in funding to 61 education and prevention-specific community drugs projects.  Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces operate a range of education and prevention programmes locally which aim to promote healthier lifestyle choices among young people and other vulnerable groups at risk of problem drug use.  </p>  <p>  In addition, young people at risk of drug misuse can access diversionary programmes, facilities and services and family support.  Significant investment is being made in the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, which seeks to divert at risk young people from becoming involved in criminal behaviour including drug-related crime and in preventing their succumbing to drug misuse.</p>  <p>  The provision of appropriate and timely treatment services is a key goal of the Strategy.  At the end of December 2014, 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week of assessment and 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment.  An additional &euro;2.1 million has been provided in the HSE budget this year for measures targeting vulnerable problem drug users, including the provision of more residential detoxification and rehabilitation places.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is beginning work on the development of a new Strategy for the period after 2016.  The process will include a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities.  It will also take account of evidence-based research, information and data sources on the extent and nature of problem drug use in Ireland.  As Minister with lead responsibility for drugs policy, I will play an active role in the development of the new strategy and I look forward to engaging with all interested parties in this work.</p></reply>

A substantial number of general practitioners have signed this contract to date.  I am confident that there will be sufficient numbers of GPs participating to introduce the new service as planned.</p>  <p>  The HSE plans to begin patient registration for the under-6 service on schedule in early June so that the under-6 GP service can commence in early July. In order for a doctor's details to be included in the HSE's on-line database when patient registration begins, signed contracts must be returned by 5 June at the latest. The HSE will continue to accept signed contracts after that date and will add the details of the doctors concerned to its database on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  On 9 May I attended the Irish College of General Practitioners' annual general meeting, at which I participated in a Question-and-Answer session on a range of issues, including the introduction of the under-6 GP service.

Since the publication of the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s Report on Portlaoise last year, much has been done to strengthen services in the hospital, and HIQA has acknowledged this.  New management is in place, with significantly improved clinical governance and additional key clinical staff have been appointed. </p>  <p>  Portlaoise Hospital is now part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group and the Government is committed to securing and further developing the role of the Hospital. Any change to its services will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner guided by what is best in terms of patient safety and outcomes. It is not appropriate to comment further at this time, other than to note that a number of staff have had complaints made to their professional regulatory bodies, in relation to their involvement in care in Portlaoise. These will be investigated in line with standard procedures and due process will apply. In addition, the HSE is finalising an investigation, in line with its Code of  Governance and Disciplinary Procedures, which may result in disciplinary action being taken against individuals involved.</p>  <p>  I have made enforcement of the implementation of HIQA recommendations a clear priority within the priorities I outlined earlier this year. Informed by the recommendations contained in the published HIQA investigation reports on various hospital services and based on analysis and internal discussions on patient safety priorities, I have come to the conclusion that providing a national focus for patient safety is best achieved by strengthening the patient safety role and functions of my Department. I intend to develop a significantly enhanced patient safety function within my Department with a clear mandate to provide the required leadership, direction and oversight for national improvements in patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience. The policy oversight for this function will be integrated within the existing system of accountability which operates through me as Minister for Health.  </p>  <p>  The Authority's Report further recommends that I should establish an oversight committee in the Department to ensure that the Portlaoise Report's recommendations are implemented. I have approved the membership, terms of reference and reporting arrangements of the committee which will be chaired by the Chief Medical Officer. The HSE will submit a plan and timetable to implement the recommendations; this plan will be used by the oversight committee to monitor the HSE's progress on implementation.</p>  <p>  Finally, I plan to establish a fully independent national advocacy service. The scope, role and functions of the independent advocacy service will be considered along with the appropriate structural, governance and funding arrangements that need to be put in place. My Department will be consulting widely on the best way to get the service up and running in the shortest possible timeframe.</p></reply>

Reviews of services at the hospital point to the need for reconfiguration of some services, to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can meet their needs.</p>  <p>  The future of the hospital is as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. That Group also includes St James's; Tallaght; Tullamore; Naas and the Coombe Hospitals. Any change to services at Portlaoise Hospital will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner. This will be guided by what is best in terms of patient safety and outcomes and will take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. The timing and scope of such changes will have regard for the capacity and capability of other services within the Group particularly in the short term. This work will be overseen by the Joint Steering Group comprised of representatives from Portlaoise and other hospitals in the Group, including the Group CEO, Dr. Susan O&rsquo;Reilly.</p>  <p>  In relation to resources, the 2015 allocation for Portlaoise is &euro;49.7m. Funding levels for hospitals are determined and set out in the HSE Annual Service Plan within the context of total funding provided to the HSE. Hospital funding is not framed or specifically determined by categorisation or designation but rather is based on the range and complexity of services provided by each hospital and by their level of activity. Activity Based Funding (ABF) is a new model for funding public hospital care.  ABF is intended to ensure a fairer system of resource allocation to hospitals. Hospitals will be funded based on the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients, and will be encouraged, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance. Full roll-out of ABF is a multi-year project and a phased approach to implementation is being taken in order to ensure operational stability in hospitals.</p></reply>

It provides a set of information which outlines the specialised health services currently used or needed by people with an intellectual disability.  Participation in the database is voluntary and not every individual in Ireland with an intellectual disability is availing of or requiring a specialised disability health and personal social service.

However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, under section 4(2), designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  My predecessor, Minister James Reilly T.D, wrote to the The Health and Social Care Professionals Council last year seeking advice on the question of specifically designating counsellors and psychotherapists under the 2005 Act. </p>  <p>  A number of issues require clarification and there are varying views among the professional bodies representing counsellors and psychotherapists in Ireland. The main questions to be resolved include whether counselling and psychotherapy should be treated as one or two professions for the purposes of regulation, the title or titles of the profession(s) to be protected, and the  minimum qualifications that would be required of applicants for registration. The readiness and compatibility of the professions for designation under the 2005 Act also need to be determined. </p>  <p>  The Council's detailed report on the matter has now been received and is being examined carefully in the Department with a view to deciding the next steps which, I envisage, will include a wider round of consultation involving the various professional bodies and other interested parties.</p></reply>

Patients have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.

Agreement between public service management and public service staff representatives was reached on a series of measures to secure an additional &euro;1 billion annual saving from the public service pay and pensions bill by 2015. A key requirement for the health service during the process was to protect front-line care while at the same time significantly reducing costs.</p>  <p>  Savings have been achieved through the reduction in the overtime rates payable, the elimination of twilight payments. Savings were also achieved through the reduction to pay for those in receipt of salaries of &euro;65,000, measures to delay or freeze increments, and balancing measures for those already at the maximum of their scales. In addition, the HRA provides for an increase in working hours for most staff and this will deliver a long-term, sustainable and unprecedented increase in productivity.   </p>  <p>  As part of the HRA a Joint Oversight Group was established to provide a forum for discussion between management and unions with a view, as far as possible, to oversee and support implementation of the terms of the Agreement as they apply to the health service. The parties agreed to resolve disputes in accordance with paragraph 5.1 of the Agreement. Where disputes progress to the Labour Court the court's decision is final and binding. </p>  <p>  The first official engagement between public sector employers and ICTU took place on Tuesday 12th May and the unions were provided with a fiscal briefing. The approach to the discussions and the way in which it will differ from the Haddington Road Agreement process will become clearer as the talks progress.</p></reply>

This role involves post market surveillance of products that have been placed on the market and are in use. </p>  <p>  The HPRA has no direct role in the authorisation of any medical device before it is placed on the market.  Medical devices such as food intolerance tests can be placed on the European market once they bear a CE mark issued by an independent certification body known as a 'notified body'. The notified body carries out a conformity assessment to confirm that the devices meets specified safety and performance requirements.  The HPRA does not approve or certify these devices for sale in Ireland or any other country, nor does it have a role in regulating the provision of food intolerance testing services by pharmacies, clinics and other entities that may be providing such services.  </p>  <p>  The HPRA issued a Medical Devices Information Notice on 24 March 2015 on Food Intolerance Testing.  This Notice may be found on the HPRA website.  The HPRA position, as set out in the Information Notice, is that the diagnosis of any condition relating to the ability to digest or "tolerate" foods should  be made in careful consultation with a doctor who is familiar with the patient's health history and should not be based on the use of self testing alone.  The HPRA does not recommend using these tests or interpreting results without this involvement as it may have negative health effects such as the removal of important food groups from an individual&rsquo;s diet, or the potential misdiagnosis of a serious medical condition.  </p>  <p>  In January the HPRA commenced an active surveillance programme on food intolerance tests.  This involves reviewing the performance and safety implications of the products and services available on the market. As part of this surveillance programme, the HPRA is cooperating with European regulatory partners, including the United Kindgom, as many of the products available in Ireland have been manufactured or received their CE mark from  notified bodies in the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  At European level, the regulatory framework for medical devices is currently being reviewed.  The purpose of this review is to strengthen the legislation including improvements to market surveillance and clinical evaluation of medical devices. The progression of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the HPRA.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

Over the past two weeks, there has been a wave of killings, militias have acted with impunity, and the country has experienced arbitrary arrests, intimidation, forced closures of media outlets and the targeting of human rights defenders.  I have condemned the coup attempt by senior military figures on 13 and 14 May, which added to the rising toll of death and injury and increased the numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>  <p>  Burundi has experienced recurring violence over the years since its independence in 1962.  The recent street protests arose in response to a decision by the ruling party to name President Pierre Nkurunziza as its candidate for a third presidential term in elections scheduled for June.  Widespread complaints that this breaches established term-limits were considered by the Constitutional Court of Burundi, which pronounced on 5 May that the candidacy is constitutional.</p>  <p>  We discussed the situation in Burundi at the EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on 18 May.  The Council condemned the attempted coup, highlighted the need for restraint, re-stated the importance of inclusive and transparent political dialogue and expressed support for the mediation efforts of the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative, the African Union and the East African Community.  The Council also stressed the importance of a credible, transparent and non-violent election process in the country and noted that, as conditions conducive to the holding of elections are not in place at the moment, they should be postponed within constitutional limitations. </p>  <p>  I am also following the situation in Burundi through our Ambassador in Dar-es-Salaam, who is also accredited to Burundi.  I am particularly concerned about the plight of Burundian refugees, with as many as 47,000 now in Tanzania.  Our Embassy in Dar-es-Salaam is closely monitoring refugee movements and engaging with and supporting the local efforts of the UN High Commission for Refugees.  In 2014, Ireland provided approximately &euro;1 million to NGO partners, Concern Worldwide and Civicus, for their work in Burundi.</p></reply>

We have also been following closely the case of vulnerable migrants, including members of the Rohingya community that have been stranded at sea in the Bay of Bengal and off the coast of South East Asia. Many migrants have landed in Malaysia and Indonesia in recent months including into the Indonesian province of Aceh. 1700 migrants are reported to have landed into this province.</p><p>Ireland welcomes the commitment announced on May 20 by the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to resolve the issue of these refugees and migrants. A solution is of the utmost importance given that the UN says that some 920 migrants are known to have perished in the Bay of Bengal between September 2014 and March 2015. The priority now must be to ensure that lives are saved and these people receive any required medical treatment and appropriate care. Ireland welcomes the commitment of Indonesia and Malaysia to allow these migrants to safely disembark.</p><p>In their statement from 20 May, the Ministers from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have said that further action will be needed including addressing the reasons for the continued flow of migrants into these nations. Ireland supports calls by the UN High Commissioner and others for the countries in the region and the international community to work together to address these root causes.</p><p>Ireland also welcomes the announcement that Thailand will host a regional meeting on irregular migration in the Indian Ocean on 29 May. We hope that a basis for further cooperation between regional countries and possible ways forward and solutions can be found at this meeting.</p><p>The underlying root causes of the migration in the region include the ethnic tensions that exist in Rakhine State in Myanmar/Burma which is home to the Rohingya people, and this issue along with all other root causes must be addressed as part of a long term solution. Ireland believes that it is imperative that there should be a guarantee of respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar/Burma and throughout the region. </p><p>Ireland has called for more investment in early recovery and support for livelihood opportunities for both the Rohingya community and the Buddhist community in Rakhine State, but a longer term Government of Myanmar Strategy for rehabilitation and reconciliation is required.</p><p>As a member of the UN Human Rights Council for the term 2012-2015, Ireland has also expressed concerns about the human rights situation of minorities in Myanmar. On March 16 of this year in Geneva, Ireland made a statement during the interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, at the 28th session of the UN Human Rights Council. We fully supported the view of the Special Rapporteur that the severe curtailment of the rights of internally displaced persons, in detention and with limited access to essential services, is a serious violation of human rights law and must be immediately addressed. Ireland also co-sponsored the EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, which reiterated the HRC&rsquo;s serious concern about the situation of persons belonging to the Rohingya minority and other minorities in Rakhine State. The HRC decided to extend for one year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar and requested a progress report to the General Assembly at its 70th session and to the HRC in accordance with its annual programme of work. The resolution was adopted by consensus.</p><p>The Irish Embassy in Vietnam, which is accredited to Myanmar/Burma, closely monitors this issue, and, in September 2013, the Ambassador travelled to Rakhine State to assess the situation on the ground.  Most recently, the Ambassador visited Naypyidaw on 23 May 2014 and met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  At that meeting he expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the situation of the Rohingya people in Rakhine State and humanitarian access to the region. In 2015, Irish Aid will provide &euro;80,000 to <i>Plan International</i>to help to address the humanitarian needs of the Rohingya community in Rakhine State.</p><p>Ireland will continue, through relevant bilateral and multilateral channels, to press the authorities in Myanmar to address the serious situation in Rakhine State, as part of a continuing process of democratic transformation.</p></reply>

We are preparing for three interlinked international conferences: in Addis in July on financing for development, in New York in September on a new set of Sustainable Development Goals and in Paris in December on a new climate treaty.  I will lead the Irish delegation to the Conference in Addis, the outcome of which will be essential for success in the subsequent conferences.  Ireland is playing a strong international role in the overall process to agree a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals, post-2015.</p>  <p>  The contours of a useful agreement will need to be broad if they are to support the new set of Sustainable Development Goals to be adopted at the major Summit at the UN in New York.  Official Development Assistance (ODA) will be a vitally important element of the package, but agreement will also be needed on a much wider range of resources for development.  ODA is particularly important for the fight to end poverty in the Least Developed Countries, including many African countries and fragile states.  Ireland supports calls to commit to the UN target of allocating 0.15% of GNP in ODA to Least Developed Countries.  We already exceed this target.</p>  <p>  Against a background of extraordinary economic challenge, the Government has broadly protected and stabilised Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme and our ODA.</p>  <p>  As our economic recovery continues to consolidate and strengthen, the challenge now is to determine how best we can make sustainable progress towards the 0.7% UN target, as we continue to build on Ireland&rsquo;s world-class aid programme by ensuring we make an effective contribution to the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger post-2015.  Ireland is committed to working with EU and UN partners to secure an inclusive agreement at Addis that will support the new, transformative Sustainable Development Goals.</p></reply>

Early each year, I agree the annual programme of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led overseas trade missions and events with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, based on the proposals submitted by Enterprise Ireland and focused on the priority markets of interest to their client companies. As part of this programme, I am currently leading a trade mission to South Africa with over thirty Irish companies who are participating in a major drive to increase Irish exports to South Africa. This mission, taking place seven months after President Higgins&rsquo; official visit, will help those Irish companies already active in the South African market to further develop sales and exports contacts, and strengthen their relationships with key contacts.</p>  <p>  In late September, I will travel to New York to participate in the General Assembly of the United Nations and to address that body on Irish foreign policy priorities.  I will also meet with Foreign Ministers and UN leaders there, to discuss a range of international issues as well as bilateral issues and Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2020. Given the importance of our economic relationship with the United States, I anticipate, as on previous visits, to prioritise opportunities to advance our economic interests and will work closely with the economic agencies on an appropriate economic promotion programme. </p>  <p>  I will also continue to attend EU related meetings, including meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and Informal Meetings of EU Foreign Ministers, over the coming months. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Mr. Se&aacute;n Sherlock T.D., Minister of State for Development, Trade Promotion and North-South Co-operation, led a trade mission to London in recent weeks and is currently preparing to lead a second UK-based mission this week. He also intends to lead trade-focussed visits to Estonia and to France in the coming months. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Diaspora Affairs, Mr. Jimmy Deenihan T.D., will travel to Colorado, Denver, Austin and San Antonio from 20-24 June. The purpose of the visits is to engage with the Irish Communities in these cities, including members of the business community. Minister Deenihan will also travel to London on 30 June, where he will launch an Irish Design 2015 &lsquo;We Built this City&rsquo; event. The aim of the event is to highlight the contribution the Irish Diaspora has made to the building of cities like London.

The world has changed a great deal in the 70 years since the UN&rsquo;s foundation, and we recognise that UN structures must change to reflect this. We believe that the Security Council must be expanded to better reflect these new realities in a regionally balanced way, and to redress the serious under-representation of some regions such as Africa. Equally however, in any reform of the composition of the Security Council, Ireland would want to prevent any diminution in the capacity of smaller Member States, such as Ireland, to serve as non-permanent members on a rotating basis and at regular intervals.</p>  <p>  Ireland would oppose the conferral of veto powers on any new Members. Like many other States, we believe that extending the veto right to additional members of the Council would only compound the difficulties associated with the current arrangements regarding veto rights. Ideally, Ireland would wish to see the veto rights of the five permanent members of the Security Council ended altogether, but if this is not possible we see merit in initiatives to regulate the use of the veto.</p>  <p>  Ireland sees the five elements for Security Council reform as inter-related parts of a single package [categories of membership, the question of the veto, regional representation, size of an enlarged Council and working methods of the Council, and the relationship between the Council and the General Assembly].  Successful reform is contingent on agreement in all five areas. </p>  <p>  We recognise that the bar to agreement on Security Council reform is high. Any amendment to the UN Charter, to give effect to Security Council Reform, would require the approval of two-thirds of the membership of the UN, including all five permanent members of the Security Council. Equally, for reforms to be durable they must enjoy the widest possible support. We would like to think that Member States will be open to compromise in the interest of obtaining overall agreement.</p>  <p>  Finally, while full reform of the Council&rsquo;s composition may be some way off, Ireland believes that the working methods of the Council in its current from can be improved. Through our membership of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group of states, we advocate for a more transparent, efficient, inclusive, coherent, legitimate and accountable Security Council.</p></reply>

This was the first meeting of EU Foreign Ministers since the formation of the Israeli government, and in the run up to the meeting I had urged High Representative (HR) Mogherini to include the Peace Process on the Council agenda.  The exchange of views was frank, and Ministers will return to the issue next month for more substantive discussions. For my part, in the exchange of views that took place, I emphasised that the EU has the capacity to make a positive difference and, further, that we have a responsibility to act. The Peace Process itself is at a standstill. We know that events on the ground are rapidly closing the window on a possible two-state solution. We must act to defend that solution which is the core of our policy on the Middle East Peace Process and the only path that will provide peace, security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians alike. I look forward to continuing discussions on the Peace Process next month - at which time HR Mogherini and newly-appointed EU Special Representative for the Peace Process, Fernando Gentilini, will report back to Ministers on their visit to the region, which took place last week.</p>  <p>  Foreign Ministers briefly addressed the crisis on the ground in Burundi, where Conclusions were adopted condemning the violence, and re-iterating support for the UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region, Sa&iuml;d Djinnit. Concern was also expressed about the crisis in Macedonia. It was agreed to monitor the situation closely, and to discuss the matter again at the Council in the near future.</p>  <p>  The Council also met in joint session with Foreign and Defence Ministers, where initially, in the presence of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, we had an exchange of views on the security situation in the EU&rsquo;s broader neighbourhood. </p>  <p>  The Council &ndash; EU Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers only  &ndash; then proceeded to discuss  preparations for the European Council in June, where Heads of State and Government will discuss the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Ministers adopted a comprehensive set of conclusions on CSDP which will feed into that discussion. Key areas covered by the conclusions include enhancing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP in contributing to international peace and security; enhancing the development of capabilities required for that purpose and improving the capacity of European industry to provide those capabilities. The conclusions highlight the fact that the EU and its Member States, through CSDP and other policy instruments, have a strong role to play in preventing and managing conflicts and addressing their causes. </p>  <p>  HR Mogherini then outlined to us her thinking on a new European Foreign Policy and Security Strategy. An assessment of the changed global environment will be prepared by HR Mogherini for consideration by Heads of State and Government when they meet next month. It is expected that work will then commence on drafting a new European Foreign Policy and Security Strategy in consultation with the Member States - Ireland will participate fully in this process. Indeed, having recently concluded a review of our own national foreign policy strategy, I believe it is timely that a similar exercise is conducted at EU level.</p>  <p>  Discussions then turned to follow up to the Special Meeting of the European Council on 23 April, attended by the Taoiseach, which addressed the migration crisis in the Mediterranean. The FAC adopted a Decision to establish a European Union operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean to disrupt the smuggler networks that drive this criminal trade in human misery and exploit vulnerable people for profit.  The Mission will be called EUNAVFOR MED and will implement its mandate in several phases. In discussions to date Ireland has insisted that the EUNAVFOR MED operation should be carried out in full accordance with international law.  The establishment of this operation is one strand of the comprehensive approach being pursued by the EU to tackle the root causes of the human emergency and to prevent the loss of more lives at sea which also includes continued provision of development  assistance to build capacity in source countries and performance of search and rescue tasks as necessary.  This follows on from the commitment made by Heads of State and Government to use all of the tools at the EU&rsquo;s disposal for this purpose.</p></reply>

This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching provision that we have ever had. These increases, building on increases which have already been provided in recent years, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teaching and SNA support to schools to support children with special educational needs and additional care needs respectively.</p>  <p>  All schools have been asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March, 2015. On 21st May, 2015, I announced that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will increase its allocation of Resource Teacher Posts to schools by over 9% for the start of the coming school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will allocate 6,454 resource teacher posts to schools for September 2015, which is an increase of 554 posts -or 9.4% - since September 2014. Even in the constrained economic circumstances we have faced in recent years, we have been able to continue to meet the needs of children with special educational needs attending our schools.</p>  <p>  This year we have again increased the number of Resource Teachers which will be allocated to schools, keeping pace with both demographic growth and increased demand. The NCSE has now published details of the allocations which will be made to each individual school on the NCSE website ncse.ie. The NCSE will also have a second round allocation process to respond to late enrolments, or from diagnosed disabilities emerging after the closing date for the first allocation round, to the start of the new school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will also consider all applications for SNA support which have been made by schools, following which allocations will be made to qualifying schools. Schools will be advised of their revised SNA allocations for the 2015/16 school year, prior to the end of the current school year. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The procedures for applying for SNA support and resource teaching hours have not changed in the current year. It remains the case that SNA support and Resource teaching hours are allocated on the basis of assessed needs of the qualifying children in line with my Departments policy.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that investment in education has been a priority for this Government and we have been resolutely committed to protecting, and in some instances increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.</p></reply>

To achieve this goal, the Council's first task was to issue a call for proposals from a consortia of industry, education and training providers, to develop new apprenticeships in areas outside the current portfolio of apprenticeship programmes. The Apprenticeship Council received 86 proposals for new apprenticeships from 48 separate organisations. This includes 10 proposals in the tourism and sport sector.  To manage the evaluation process in a fair and consistent manner the Apprenticeship Council established an evaluation panel, assisted by an independent process auditor, to evaluate submitted proposals. The evaluation panel is currently in the process of evaluating the submissions.</p><p>  It should also be noted that in relation to the hospitality sector, SOLAS is currently engaged in the development of a pilot Career Traineeship model of training programme delivery for the hotel sector. This model is being developed in partnership with Education and Training Boards (ETBs) the Irish Hotel Federation, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and hoteliers. These pilot training programmes will commence in the last quarter of 2015.</p></reply>

It remains open to any school to encourage its students to learn and sing the anthem, at school events or otherwise.</p>  <p>  It is not Departmental policy to impose regulations on schools regarding national expression, so there are no directives or guidelines on the use of the anthem beyond that identified in primary SPHE. This is consistent with government practice in most countries today.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, schools are free to incorporate the learning of the anthem within their curricular provision, such as in music or singing lessons, and a number of initiatives in this regard have been given Departmental support. These include the distribution of a CD of the National Children's Choir signing our national anthem to every school some years ago, and the Taoiseach's launch of the Gael Linn 'Gaelbhratach' initiative earlier in 2015. This latter idea promotes the teaching of the national anthem from third class onwards, as part of an overall school approach to the use of Irish in communication.</p></reply>

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is currently preparing Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism. The NCSE has advised my Department that the Policy Advice will be delivered shortly.</p><p>  I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years. </p><p>  The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of children diagnosed with Asperger's that were/are attending mainstream primary and secondary schools is not available.</p><p>  Information on the number of children diagnosed with Autism that were attending mainstream primary and secondary schools in 2005 and 2010 is not readily available, but I will arrange for the National Council for Special Education to respond directly to the Deputy with this data.</p><p>  The number of children diagnosed with Autism that are attending mainstream settings in primary and secondary schools in 2014/15 school year is 5,793 at primary level and 2,946 at post-primary level.  In addition, there are 2,585 children with Autism in special classes in mainstream schools.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p><p>  Home tuition is provided to children with autism aged between 2&frac12; and 3 years of age as they cannot enrol in a school until they reach the age of three.  Parents can choose to enrol children with autism in an early intervention class from the age of three and where such a placement is not available home tuition is approved. Children with autism over the age of four may also be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications for primary and post-primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents are encouraged to liaise with the local SENO to discuss placement options for their child.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the National Council Special Education (NCSE) is currently at an advanced stage in the preparation of policy advice on the education of children with autism which includes a review of early intervention provision.  I expect that the NCSE final report, which is to be delivered shortly, will reflect the broadest possible range of views, both National and International and will provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

While the research is useful it is important to note that the survey did not include a school management perspective or encompass the role of other teachers in schools given that guidance provision is a whole school activity.</p><p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p><p>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.</p><p>  I have no plans to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools. If economic recovery continues I hope the Government will be in a position to improve the standard staffing allocation to schools. However, I believe that it is desirable to give schools discretion on how to use those increased resources. </p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support. </p><p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students.  NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools.  Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.</p><p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on &quot;wellbeing&quot; being studied by all pupils.</p></reply>

In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice.  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.</p><p>The budget measure that required schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation was introduced as an alternative to an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule. Such an adjustment would be the equivalent of an 0.6 change in the staffing schedule.  My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations so that it is based on a ratio of 18.25:1 compared to the standard 19:1 &ndash; an improvement of 0.75 on the standard staffing schedule for these schools.  </p><p>  The net reduction in guidance provision as a consequence of this budget measure was of the order of 500 posts. The annual budget saving from this measure is over &euro;30 million. This gives an indication of the cost involved if this budget measure was not in place.  Confining such a budget measure to fee-charging schools would not significantly change this estimated cost.</p><p>  I have no plans to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools. If economic recovery continues I hope the Government will be in a position to improve the standard staffing allocation to schools.

The  criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements  annually and are available on the Department website.</p><p>At post primary level and in addition to teacher allocations based largely on  pupil teacher ratios, an ex-quota allocation of one teaching post is also  allocated to Island schools. In accordance with the published staffing  arrangements each school management authority is required to organise its  subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The  deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and  ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a  matter for the school management authorities. </p><p>  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a  school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within  its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional  short term support i.e., curricular concessions.  Short term support is needed  (normally for one year but not exceeding 2/3 school years) to enable the school  authority to respond to the identified difficulty in meeting essential  curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation. </p><p>  The detail of the curricular concession process is set out with the criteria  for the allocation of posts and is also available on the website. </p><p>  At primary level the staffing arrangements for the 2015/16 school year are set  out in Department Circular 0005/2015 which is available on my Department's  website at www.education.gov.ie.  Section 1 of the Circular sets out the  retention arrangements for Island Schools in the event that a reduction in the  pupil numbers of an island school will result in the loss of the second or  third classroom teaching post and where the school is the only primary school  remaining on the island. </p><p>  The circular also sets out the improvements to the staffing schedule for the  2015/16 school year for small schools. These improvements are improved  retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the  improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools.  </p><p>  The allocation processes also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools  can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The  appeal procedures are also set out in the published staffing arrangements.  The  Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is  final. </p><p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return  to a position where we are seeing economic growth.  It is a continuing  improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us  to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher  resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class  size and support for classroom teachers. </p><p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated  resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes. </p><p>  My Department launched its &quot;Policy Proposals for Educational Provision in  Gaeltacht areas&quot; on 5 May, 2015.  The proposals aim to strengthen Irish-medium  provision in Gaeltacht schools. They include a range of policy options and  measures that could potentially address the challenges facing Gaeltacht  schools. Interested parties have been invited to provide their views in  relation to the policy options set out in the document.  This will be done  through a survey and responses are requested by 15 June 2015.  It is hoped that  organisations and individuals in the Gaeltacht and with an interest in  Gaeltacht education will respond to the survey.  It is also intended to meet  with stakeholder groups during the consultation process.  It is expected that  there will be a forum in the autumn where the findings of the consultation will  be considered. </p><p>  Such responses will inform the development of a Gaeltacht Education Policy.  The  level of resourcing required to deliver the agreed policy will be a key  consideration when the consultation is concluded.  The new Gaeltacht Education  policy should be available in 2016.</p></reply>

Third level institutions are autonomous bodies and it is therefore a matter for the institution to determine the rate of fee payable by students (EU or non-EU). </p><p>  However, in the case of students who do not meet the residency clause, higher education institutions have been requested to charge the more moderate EU fee to EU/EEA/Swiss nationals who have completed at least five academic years of study (Primary or Post-Primary level) in the EU/EEA or Switzerland. </p><p>  It has been agreed that a review of this measure will be carried out early in the 2015/16 academic year, following this work my Department will be better placed to provide the detailed costing referred to by the Deputy.  There are no plans at present to amend the residency requirement of the Free Fees Initiative.</p></reply>

In pursuing settlements, the State Claims Agency will be considering cases of school child sexual abuse where there was a prior complaint about the relevant teacher's sexual abuse to school authorities.  The rationale for this approach is that these were the circumstances on which the European Court of Human Rights judgment was based.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to those cases that were not progressed for a number of reasons, including those which might have been discontinued after receiving letters from the State Claims Agency is that I asked the Agency to undertake a review to clarify the exact position as to whether the cases had been formally discontinued or not.  The Agency has completed its review and my Department is considering its report and has sought some clarification from the Agency.  I expect to be in a position to report to Government on this matter shortly at which time the Government will consider whether any measures will be taken in relation to these cases.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the coming school year 2015/16 are set out in Circular 0005/2015 which is available on the website.</p><p>My Department introduced reforms to the teacher allocation process for resource hours in recent years which included the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools to cater for NCSE approved resource hours for individual pupils in schools.  This network of base posts is designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level. 83% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours in the 2014/15 school year were allocated to schools that had permanent resource base posts.  There will be no changes to the location of permanent resource base posts for the 2015/16 school year.</p><p>  Schools with a resource base post are required to co-operate with their neighbouring schools to ensure that any surplus capacity in the (25 hour) resource post(s) is made available to neighbouring schools to meet their NCSE approved resource hour requirements. </p><p>  Schools that do not have a resource base post are required to check for available surplus capacity in base posts in neighbouring schools before making an application to the Department's Primary Teacher Allocations Section. </p><p>  Where a school that does not have a base post has been approved for 25 or more NCSE approved hours, a temporary post will be sanctioned for the 2015/16 school year. </p><p>  Where a school has less than 25 hours that cannot be met from other schools, sanction will be given for part time hours. </p><p>  When the allocations and redeployment process for surplus permanent/CID holding teachers is completed later in the summer, schools that have complied with the published staffing arrangements will be given some discretion to operate, where possible, their own temporary local arrangements in relation to the day to day work arrangements of teachers in full-time shared posts.  These arrangements are aimed at minimising any time lost in travelling between schools.</p></reply>

Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or on the basis of some other criterion.

Work shadowing with experienced inspectors provides opportunities to observe models of inspection in practice.  Other elements of the induction programme include upskilling in the provision of feedback, of data collection and analysis, and of reporting orally and in written format in English and Irish, as appropriate to the language medium through which the inspector will work.  The programme seeks to build on inductees' own professional background and experience, and to develop the knowledge, skills and competences required to fulfil the role of the inspector. </p><p>  All inspectors participate in a programme of continuing professional development in line with the individual inspector's needs and the business needs of the Inspectorate.

When state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest. This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period. </p><p>  As a result of negotiations in the late 1990's on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease.  The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property.  Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing. </p><p>  The Deed of Variation refers to a change in the terms of a charging lease or Declaration of Trust. With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p><p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. </p><p>  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  The legislation also provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. </p><p>  The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent. </p><p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. </p><p>  The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

The document referred to by the Deputy relates to the terms of the arrangements for the provision of funding to the private commercial organisation.  These arrangements take account of the fact that children are tutored in group settings giving rise significant cost savings.  My Department has no contract with this or any other provider.  The contract is essentially between the parents and the provider.</p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that it is, in my view, reasonable to conclude that the Department has maintained a consistent position in relation to the development of group arrangements and direct payment arrangements for home tuition and that the scheme is operated in a consistent and equitable manner.</p>  <p>  The rates agreed between my Department and a number of providers in 2013/2014 represents significant value for money.  The rate agreed with the one provider was agreed in 2008 and is subject to review and my Department will decide if and when such a review should be undertaken.  The rates agreed with the later organistations were the best rates which could be agreed at the time and represent value for money for the Department.</p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process.  55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.  A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on this occasion.</p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector.</p><p>On 25 May 2015 I announced that that funding will be provided from 1 July this year to 30 June 2016 to a number of health, disability and other organisations following a review in relation to the impact of the cessation of their current funding on 30 June 2015.</p><p>Funding of &euro;1.32 million is being made available for this 12 month period to organisations, currently funded under a bridging scheme which was put in place to support the majority of organisations who were unsuccessful in their applications under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) but had received funding previously from it up to 30 June 2014 and submitted a valid application in 2014.  This further support will be based on current levels of funding to the organisations in question and is being provided through a Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations.  The funding to be provided to each organisation is set out in the table.</p><p>It is envisaged that the new Scheme to Support National Organisations will be advertised in early 2016 and all groups will be required to apply for funding under the Scheme and meet the criteria required for funding.  The funding over the next 12 months will give time for organisations to prepare their applications.<table><tr><th>Bridging Funding Provided 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland </td><td>53,882 </td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td>19,066 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td>33,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td>70,462 </td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities</td><td>45,592</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The NPPR Charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment.</p><p>A number of exemptions from the charge are set out in section 4 of the 2009 Act.  Section 4(1)(b) of the Act provides that discretionary trusts within the meaning of section 2 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 or bodies corporate that are accorded charitable status under tax law (section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended)) are not required to pay the NPPR charge for residential properties that they own.</p><p>The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted.  The guidelines, which are available at encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases.  It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by installment.  All non-compliant owners or owners with queries should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments.</p></reply>

If a customer does not pay their water charges, late payment provisions shall automatically apply, unless the customer enters into a payment plan.  In the case of a One Adult Household (capped at &euro;160), &euro;30 will be added to any bill where outstanding payments equate to the total annual payment and remain unpaid for 3 months or more.  An additional &euro;30 will be added on every anniversary of the original add on date while the bill remains unpaid or a payment plan has not been entered into with Irish Water.  In the case of a Two Adult Household (capped at &euro;260), &euro;60 will be added and again at each anniversary.</p>  <p>  The late payment charges will only apply where someone is in arrears for more than 12 months and has not entered into a payment plan with Irish Water.  Payment plans will be developed based on an ability to pay and it is important to note that the late payment charges are focused on those who &ldquo;will not pay&rdquo;, rather than those who cannot pay.</p>  <p>  A range of flexible payment options will be available. Irish Water will facilitate bill payment through direct debit, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a Paypoint or Payzone sign, or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made.  The overall net cost for those who register is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others.  Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.</p>  <p>  Any customers who have unpaid water charges can be pursued through the Courts by Irish Water for the sums due and a debt judgment may be obtained against the customer.  As announced recently, the Government intends to bring forward legislation to implement a number of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the enforcement of debt.  Accordingly, my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality will be bringing forward a Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill which will allow creditors to apply to the Court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deduction form social welfare payments, as appropriate for the purposes of enforcing debt.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed Charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid.</p>  <p>  Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge.  The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities.  If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014.  As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.  In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen; the legislation does not provide for further penalties to apply after this date.   </p>  <p>  As the NPPR charge is based on self-declaration and the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment, it is not possible to state with any certainty the level of non-compliance with the Charge.  Section 11 of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 provides for the exchange of data between local authorities and certain bodies defined in the Act, being the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Electricity Supply Board, the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social Protection and any other person prescribed for the purpose under the section.  I am confident that compliance levels are high as a result of data matching undertaken with other public bodies as provided for in the legislation.</p>  <p>  The 2009 Act, as amended, places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority; my Department has no role in relation to enforcement of the Charge.  The data requested in relation to the numbers of notices issued by local authorities, the potential liability for the Charge related to those notices, the numbers of persons who availed of the grace period, the numbers of certificates of certificates of discharge issued by local authorities and the numbers of payment plans entered into is therefore not available in my Department.  The Local Government Management Agency coordinates certain matters relating to the NPPR, acting on an agency basis on behalf of the local government sector.</p>  <p>  According to data provided by the Local Government Management Agency, NPPR payments in excess of &euro;40 million were collected by local authorities in the grace period 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014.  An additional amount of almost &euro;50 million has been collected since 1 September 2014.</p></reply>

Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  Section 19 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 makes it an offence to exhibit articles or advertisements on property in or visible from a public place without the prior written authority of the relevant owner, occupier or person in charge.  In the case of an advertisement, the person on whose behalf the advertisement is exhibited will also be guilty of an offence.</p>  <p>  Section 20 of the Litter Pollution Act (powers of local authorities regarding articles and advertisements on, and defacement of, certain structures, etc.) applies in regard to the display of advertisements on perimeter railings or street lamps.  Under this Section, a local authority may serve a notice on the occupier of land requiring the removal of an advertisement exhibited on any structure or land that is in or visible from a public place if it appears to the local authority that it is in the interests of amenity or of the environment that the advertisement be removed.  However, the Section also provides that it is a defence in any action for failure to comply with such a notice to show that the exhibition of the advertisement concerned was in accordance with a planning permission.  I currently have no proposals to review these provisions.</p></reply>

The existing compulsory muzzling of the 12 then-restricted breeds should be retained, except for Pit Bull Terrier and Japanese Tosa.</p>  <p>  The view of the IVA was that dogs of the Pit Bull Terrier, Dogo Argentina, Japanese Tosa and Filo Brasilia breeds should be subject to a continued requirement for muzzling and lead control in public areas, that further importation of these dogs should be banned and that those already in the country should be neutered.</p>  <p>  The ISPCA, while having reservations in relation to muzzling all dogs of a particular breed, understood the Minister&rsquo;s first duty is to ensure as far as possible that the general public is protected from unnecessary risk.  They reluctantly agreed to muzzling and maintenance on a lead in a public place of all American Pit Bull Terriers and all internationally known fighting dogs.</p>  <p>  The IKC rejected the concept of muzzling dogs by reason of their breed.</p>  <p>  The ISPCA was consulted in 1998 in relation to a number of matters and expressed reservations about muzzling generally as they felt it could lead to behavioural problems in dogs, and that muzzling (but not leashing) should be relaxed as a first step in the case of the Bulldog, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and English Bull Terrier.  The ISPCA considered all dogs should be on a leash in a public place as many dog owners were incapable of keeping their dogs under effectual control.</p>  <p>  To ensure as far as possible that the general public would be protected from unnecessary risk, the compulsory provision of muzzling and leashing in public was retained in the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 for the following breeds: American Pit Bull Terrier, English Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Bull Mastiff, Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd (Alsatian), Rhodesian Ridgeback, Rottweiler, Japanese Akita, Japanese Tosa, Bandog and strains and crosses of these breeds.</p>  <p>  The Control of Dogs (Restriction of Certain Breeds) Regulations 1991, repealed by the 1998 Regulations, also included the Bulldog on the list of restricted breeds.  The Bulldog was not included on the list of restricted breeds in the 1998 Regulations on advice that the breed is physically unsuitable for muzzling and is not considered to present the degree of risk posed by the other breeds of dogs.</p>  <p>  I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 542, 543 and 559 on 6 May 2015 in relation to the reasons why I have no plans to amend the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to 2010 in respect of these matters.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these specific control requirements for the listed breeds are a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, respects animal welfare to the extent possible, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury, or cause death.</p></reply>

The scheme targets low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  Recognising that similar mortgage arrears distress was being experienced by people with mortgages borrowed from local authorities and recognising the scale of the problem, the Government piloted a Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme in Dublin City and Westmeath County Councils in 2013.  The LAMTR Scheme was rolled out nationally in February 2014.</p>  <p>  The LAMTR scheme allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.  This enables families to stay in their home and their established community.  Surrendering the ownership equity in a home is a very difficult decision for a family; however, the mortgage to rent option does provide families with stability and continuity, after an often long period of financial turmoil.  Ownership of the home transfers to the local authority and the family pays a differential rent.  My Department is keeping the operation of the LAMTR scheme under constant review.</p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department received and approved a total of 18 claims under the pilot LAMTR scheme. In 2014, 63 claims were received and approved.  To date in 2015, six claims have been received and will be processed shortly.  In total, my Department has paid &euro;7.971m in respect of 81 claims.  A 2015 budget allocation of &euro;10m is available for Mortgage to Rent, including both the LAMTR and private MTR schemes.  Both Mortgage to Rent schemes are demand led and offered, as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, where it is considered the most appropriate resolution, from a range of possible resolutions, for householders with unsustainable mortgages.</p></reply>

In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases.  It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners.  In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.  All non-compliant owners or owners with queries should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments.</p></reply>

The capped annual charges will be &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018.  All households now know what their capped bills will be until the end of 2018, which is particularly important for larger households or those with high usage due to medical needs.</p>  <p>  In addition, a water conservation grant of &euro;100 per year will be available to qualifying households.  The Department of Social Protection is administering the grant on behalf of my Department, which will be available to households (principal private dwellings) that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process on or before 30 June 2015. </p>  <p>  The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced and is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future.</p>  <p>  The charges structure was revised with a view to making it simpler and fairer, providing more clarity and certainty to households.  The overall cost for those who register with Irish Water, net of the &euro;100 water conservation grant, is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others.  Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.</p>  <p>  When it comes to payment, a range of easy pay options are in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made.  Irish Water also intends participating in the Household Budget scheme.  This facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, provides customers with a facility to have their household utility bills and social housing rents deducted directly from their weekly social welfare payment.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I issued a Direction to a number of key housing authorities on 27 January 2015 to prioritise homeless and other vulnerable households.  This Direction applies for six months, from 27 January 2015 to 26 July 2015.  Under this Direction, each of the Dublin housing authorities must ensure that at least 50% of the dwellings available for allocation under Section 22 of the 2009 Act during the specified period will be allocated to such households that had qualified for social housing support on or before 1 December 2014.  Data submitted by housing authorities in the Dublin Region indicated that a total of 597 units were allocated in the Dublin Region, under Section 22, in the three-month period, since the Direction was introduced of which approximately 38% were allocated to homeless and other vulnerable households.</p><p>I am making an additional &euro;10.5 million of &lsquo;Section 10&rsquo; funding available for homeless accommodation and services across the country in 2015.  This is an increase in funding of over 20%, bringing the Exchequer contribution to &euro;55.5 million.  The 2015 regional allocations are currently being finalised with a view to their confirmation shortly.  To date in 2015, my Department has recouped &euro;12,528,889 in &lsquo;Section 10&rsquo; funding to Dublin City Council.</p><p>South Dublin County Council has recently completed the purchase of a NAMA apartment block, as the preferred alternative to a hotel property, which will operate as an assessment centre for homeless families providing 65 units of accommodation.  A service level agreement has been put in place with a provider and it is expected that this facility will be fully operational by June.</p></reply>

I am currently in the process of developing a new Energy Policy Paper which will set out Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy out to 2030.  The Public Service Obligation (PSO), and the levy associated with it, are matters for consideration, along with many others, in the context of developing the forthcoming policy document.  However, given the total amount of the PSO has to be recovered by the levy, it should be noted that changes to it which would have the effect of reducing the amount paid by some users, as proposed in the paper submitted by the Deputy, would result in some, or all, other users paying more.  This is acknowledged in the paper.</p>  <p>  The PSO levy has been in place since 2001 and is the overall support mechanism for generation constructed for security of supply purposes, including peat generation, and for the development of renewable electricity.  It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. No. 217 of 2002).  The annual PSO levy amount for 2014/2015 is &euro;335.4 million. This equates to &euro;64.37 per annum for residential customers, &euro;221.66 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;34.20/kVA for medium and large customers.</p>  <p>  The biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is estimated to be around 10% lower than last year.  This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs.  The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since mid-2013.  This drives up the proposed PSO levy.  However, if these lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, it will reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay. In turn, suppliers should be in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase. I note increased competition in the retail electricity sector recently which should help offset some of the PSO increase. The CER is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.</p></reply>

Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Ratings (BER).</p><p>In March of this year I announced increases of between 25% and 50% in the grant levels awarded to householders under the scheme.  In addition, a bonus payment has been introduced for householders that complete three or more energy efficiency improvements.</p><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households who meet the defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty.  Recipients of the scheme do not receive grants but have measures installed free of charge.  Since the commencement of the scheme in 2000, almost 123,150 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures under the Scheme.  &euro;15.8m has been allocated to the Scheme for 2015.</p><p>The Better Energy Areas &amp;amp; Communities Scheme supports sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings and facilities in the community sector as well as clusters of homes likely to be at risk of energy poverty.  The Areas and Communities scheme was amalgamated last year and &euro;14.2 million in Exchequer funding has been allocated for 2015.</p><p>Over the period 2012-2014 the two schemes provided &euro;46.8m in direct grant assistance.  This supported 230 individual projects, resulting in the upgrade of a total of 9,644 homes, the majority of them in energy poverty.</p><p>From 2006-2011 the Greener Homes Scheme supported householders wishing to install renewable energy heating technologies, including wood pellet/chip stoves and boilers, solar panels and geothermal heat pumps.  The programme facilitated the wider deployment of renewable energy heating technologies in the residential sector, and supported the development of a sustainable market, resulting in reduced dependence on fossil fuels and lower CO2 emissions.</p><p>The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme provided assistance to homeowners interested in improving the energy efficiency of their houses in order to reduce energy use, energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions.  The scheme was piloted in 2008 and fully deployed on a national basis in 2009.  HES supported the installation of over 33,400 energy efficiency measures in over 18,100 homes in 2009.</p><p>A breakdown on the amount of grants awarded under the Better Energy Programme is provided in the following table (for 2015 the figure relates to spend to date).</p><p>SEAI Programme Spend 2006-2015 (to date)<table><tr><th>Programme (Spend in &euro;m)</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Greener Homes Scheme</td><td>4.3m</td><td>26.7</td><td>22.5</td><td>11.6</td><td>6.5</td><td>Greener Homes Scheme phased out in 2010.

A new Energy Policy Paper, which will set out Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy up to 2030, is being developed.  To facilitate the development of the new Policy Paper, a Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland was published in May 2014 opening a written public consultation process that concluded on 31 July 2014.  The Green Paper sets out six policy priority areas in respect of which submissions were sought.  Over 1,200 submissions were received in the written consultation process. In addition, there was a targeted stakeholder consultation process involving 11 seminars, six of which focused on the priorities identified in the Green Paper, four regional seminars and a seminar on costs.  My Department is carrying out the detailed work needed to develop the new Policy Paper which I aim to publish in October.</p>  <p>  A central focus of discussions arising from the consultations and stakeholder engagement process has been the need to place the citizen at the heart of our energy policy and the need to address local community and rural concerns, particularly those that are focused on the building of new infrastructure.  This has coincided with initiatives such as those undertaken by Eirgrid in revising its approach to public engagement.  For instance, in March of this year Eirgrid published, for public comment, a discussion paper on Ireland's grid development strategy - "Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow."</p>  <p>  The discussion document presents an ideal opportunity for all communities, both rural and urban, to provide their views on any future development of electricity transmission infrastructure.</p></reply>

Its property portfolio comprises circa 9 acres, on which it has over 100,000 sq. feet of commercial office space, as well as a number of derelict, protected buildings fronting onto several streets in this historic area. Currently, it is home to some 86 digital enterprises, employing more than 930 people.</p>  <p>  The DHDA's property portfolio has been significantly enhanced as a result of the strategic partnership arrangement between DHDA and Knightsbridge Student Housing Ltd (KSH), entered into in March 2014.  Under this agreement, the DHDA&rsquo;s derelict 19th century Grainstore building has been refurbished by KSH, to provide the Digital Hub with an additional 10,650 square feet of enterprise office.  The DHDA is now undertaking the fit-out of the building to office standard, with a view to the first tenants occupying the building this autumn. This expansion in its office capacity will allow the DHDA to continue to grow its enterprise cluster, while contributing to the economic sustainability and regeneration of the Liberties area.</p>  <p>  The arrangement will also see KSH develop high quality student accommodation on an acre site, formerly part of the Digital Hub campus.  Construction work on this 500-bed student accommodation development is on target for completion in September 2016.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that this strategic partnership is delivering a quantum of office space for the Digital Hub, and in turn will bring new activity and renewed energy of both young students and digital entrepreneurs to the area.</p></reply>

To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  To date onshore wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  The existing feed-in tariff schemes supporting onshore wind are a very cost effective tool to support renewable energy development relative to other EU Member States.  Ireland's approach was confirmed as one of the most cost effective within the EU by a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January this year.</p>  <p>  The cost effectiveness of support for renewables is a key consideration in the work now underway in my Department to consider the appropriateness and design of any new support scheme for renewable electricity.  Any scheme would be subject to EU rules on State Aid.  The commercial success of onshore wind means that we are now at the point where a gradual move to a more market based support for the technology is appropriate.  Taking account of developments in EU electricity market integration, my Department will be engaging with stakeholders in this work, a key component of which will be consideration of the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of any support required.</p></reply>

The NBS, combined with private sector investment in the broadband market over recent years, means that there is now a choice of commercial operators offering basic broadband services, over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout Ireland.</p><p>With reference to the particular quality of service issues outlined in the Question, since the customer is being served by &ldquo;3&rdquo; in its commercial capacity, my department no longer has a role in the resolution of performance issues.  The provision of electronic communications services occurs within a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent market regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  If, after having exhausted the service provider&rsquo;s complaint handling procedures, a customer is not happy, they may contact the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, on 1890 229 668, online at or by email at for further assistance and guidance.</p><p>The National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.  This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016.  The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.</p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators, 100% of premises in the Athy area will be covered by the commercial sector by the end of 2016.  Members of the public should access the map for themselves to establish the precise status of their individual premises.  I note that other mobile services providers are also upgrading 3G and 4G services across Ireland with at least one operator already having 94% population coverage of 4G.</p><p>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area.  Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.</p><p>I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 3 to 5 year period.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in mainly rural parts of the country.</p></reply>

I can confirm that the grants are being maintained at this level for the current year also.  In addition, in 2014 my Department granted a special once-off capital grant of &euro;200,000 to Mountain Rescue Ireland, the all-island overarching body responsible for mountain rescue, for the purchase of vehicles which I believe was drawn down just last week. </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated to the House, MRTs are not tasked directly by the IRCG, rather they are tasked by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  While I accept the vital nature of the commitment made by these voluntary groups, I believe that within the IRCG, budgetary priority must be given to the primary responsibility of providing a marine emergency response service.  The IRCG has a responsibility to equip and train approx. 918 Volunteers from 44 Volunteer Units around the Country.  Each Unit is subject to operational readiness audits to ensure they are positioned to provide a safe and effective service. </p>  <p>  Therefore, with the current and competing pressures among the budgets in my portfolio, I cannot commit to any increase in funding at this present moment.</p></reply>

The University of Ghent report on atypical employment in aviation was published in February this year and my Department and I are aware of it.  The report was produced under the European Social Dialogue Committee by social policy experts.</p>  <p>  The EU's extensive aviation safety regime is separate to the European Social Dialogue.  The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has competence for all areas of aviation safety in the EU and is best placed to give an expert view on any potential safety impacts of various working arrangements.  Ireland has a strong reputation for robust regulatory oversight of civil aviation.  Our safety oversight regime is based on EU law and also accords with all applicable International Civil Aviation Organisation requirements.  Ireland's safety oversight regime has been recognised as among the best in the world by ICAO under its Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme. Aviation safety risks are managed within this framework.</p></reply>
