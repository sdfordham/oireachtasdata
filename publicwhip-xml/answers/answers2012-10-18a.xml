The Council meets in this format in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in the area of tourism including decisions on policies and actions to be implemented by Tourism Ireland Limited, the body responsible for promoting the island of Ireland overseas as a tourist destination.  Funding for Tourism Ireland's operations is provided by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and by my Department in the South. </p><p>  The last NSMC meeting in Tourism Sectoral format took place on 25 January last while the next one is scheduled to take place on 28 November in Armagh.  Amongst the items likely to be discussed at the meeting are a review of this year's visitor numbers to the island of Ireland, Tourism Ireland's Business Plan for 2013 and major tourism opportunities north and south in 2013. </p><p>In terms of overall approaches to tourism development on the island of Ireland, the Deputy may be aware that t<font color="#333333">he Tourism Recovery Taskforce (TRT), which was formed in early 2011 with the aim of ensuring growth in inbound tourism, includes representation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the NITB and Tourism Ireland as well as other relevant stakeholders in the tourism sector North and South.  It is expected that the recommendations of the TRT will form input to the Business Plans of the tourism agencies for the years ahead.</font></p><p>  In terms of the general coordination between the tourism agencies, the Chief Executive of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Chair of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board both sit on the Board of Tourism Ireland.  The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Authority also meets the Board of Tourism Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on an ongoing basis to discuss issues of mutual interest on tourism.   Furthermore the Chief Executives and senior management teams in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board work hard to foster ever closer working relationships between the agencies.  This includes joint preparation of marketing programmes.    </p></reply>

According to the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey for April to June 2012, the largest increase in employment in any sector over the year to June 2012 was in tourism-related jobs, with employment in the Accommodation and Food sector increasing by 5.9% or 6,300 jobs.  </p><p>  As regards arrivals, following a return to growth last year for the first time since 2007, the latest CSO figures show that overseas visits to Ireland in January-August 2012 showed a marginal decrease of 1.4% when compared to 2011, while the peak June-August period saw a fall of 2% in trips.  At main market level, results were mixed.  Despite continued growth from continental Europe &ndash; the main source of overseas tourism revenue - and from the high-spending other areas of developing markets, there was a decline in trips from Great Britain and a slight decline from North America.  The British market in particular is proving difficult, with a flat economy and weak consumer confidence having a significant impact on outbound travel generally, while the Olympics generally seemed to have limited effect on consumer demand in Britain.  </p><p>  Tourism Ireland has been conducting an extensive promotional programme this year, focused on our main markets including Britain and North America.  Its autumn campaign aims to boost late-season travel to Ireland from around the globe, as well as promoting The Gathering Ireland 2013.  For next year, The Gathering will form the central focus of all tourism campaigns, with the work carried out by the Tourism Recovery Taskforce further informing marketing plans and activity in British and North American markets.</p><p>   An important part of improving tourist numbers from foreign markets is air access.  The Dublin Airport Authority has some very attractive incentive schemes in place, including a long-haul incentive scheme, offering significant discounts on various charges for airlines opening up new routes.  In particular, air access to the North American market is crucial to success in that tourist market.</p><p>  As part of a recent tourist mission to North America to promote the Gathering, I met with United Airlines in Chicago and a new Chicago-Shannon route has been confirmed for next summer.  Discussions are ongoing with a number of other carriers for additional capacity linked to both general traffic demand and the expected increased traffic linked to the Gathering.</p><p>  Current indications are that transatlantic capacity for summer 2013 will be higher than summer 2012, which was in the region of 27,500 seats per week.  Tourism Ireland continues to work closely with Dublin Airport Authority to secure additional capacity.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s tourism performance is dependent on improvements in the economic situation and consumer confidence in overseas markets, as well as the efforts of the industry and the agencies to promote our tourism offering and deliver a competitive and quality product.  Using The Gathering as our centrepiece for 2013, working with Tourism Ireland to sell Ireland as a destination overseas and with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to continually strengthen the competitiveness of our product, I am confident that we can grow tourist numbers and employment in the sector for 2013 and beyond.</p></reply>

My Department has no direct control over this cost but keeps under review all costs over which we do have an influence, including the cost of services provided through our agencies.  In this context, my Department is engaged in an initiative to reduce, where feasible, the administration cost to business of complying with transport legislation.</p><p>  From my contacts with the haulage industry, I am aware that they have raised the issue of reducing taxation on fuel.  However, this is a matter primarily for the Minister for Finance.    </p><p>  The Government's plans to address the economic difficulties facing all elements of the economy are set out in the Programme for Government and place a heavy emphasis on the delivery of effective transport services.  In addition, the Government's Jobs Initiative includes a number of measures intended to stimulate tourism by increasing the competitiveness of access transport and our tourism product.</p><p>  I have outlined my priorities to 2016 on my Department's website and in my Department's Statement of Strategy.  There is constant ongoing contact at all levels in my Department with stakeholders and, in particular, during the preparation of this three year strategy.  A key commitment in the Strategy 2011-2014 is to increase tourism numbers to 8 million by 2015.  The Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy of 2010 envisaged that this would result in an additional 15,000 jobs directly employed in tourism.  </p><p>  Earlier this year I set out on my Department&#8217;s website details of the progress that I and my Department have made since my appointment (). I would also refer the Deputy to my reply to Question 704 on Tuesday, 9th October, 2012 in which I gave an update on progress on the Programme for Government commitments for which I have specific responsibility.  </p></reply>

Up to 180,000 people are employed in the industry and total tourism revenues in 2011 are estimated at &euro;5.5 billion.  That is why - despite our enormous national financial difficulties - the Government continues to deploy a range of programmes and measures to support the sector and to enhance competitiveness and to maintain our marketing drive at home and overseas.  I remain in regular contact with major stakeholders in the tourism sector and am kept advised on trends and issues of concern to the industry.   </p><p>  As demonstrated by last year's Jobs Initiative and the Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government recognises the vital contribution of tourism to employment.  The VAT reduction on a range of tourism services from 13.5% to 9% enhances the competitiveness of our tourism product and this lower rate of VAT will continue through 2013.  In addition, the Visa Waiver Scheme is encouraging visitors from emerging markets to add Ireland to a trip to the UK, and the halving of employers&rsquo; PRSI for those on modest wages has significantly reduced the cost of employing people.  </p><p>  The measures put in place to support tourism helped to contribute to growth of almost 8% in visitor numbers in 2011.  In addition, the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey shows that 6,300 more people were employed in accommodation and food services in the second quarter of this year compared to the same quarter in 2011 and 10,600 more people compared to the first quarter in 2011. </p><p>  The Gathering Ireland 2013 has the potential to provide enhanced business opportunities and to give a further lift to growth next year.  A great deal of time and energy has been invested in putting structures and resources in place to to give this ambitious initiative every chance of being successful.  </p><p>   </p></reply>

This work involves the mutual recognition, rather than harmonisation, of certain road traffic offences, along with the penalty points associated with those offences in each jurisdiction.  Harmonisation would be a much more complex issue to address and is not envisaged at this time.</p><p>  It was agreed at the NSMC Transport Sectoral meeting on 21 October 2011 that officials would work together to bring forward proposals for the introduction of the mutual recognition of penalty points for speeding, drink/drug driving, non-wearing of seatbelts and using a mobile phone while driving.  </p><p>  The detailed timetable agreed at the North South Ministerial Council Meeting held on 5 October 2012 includes the key milestones for the drafting, passage and enactment of parallel legislation, North and South, by 31 December 2014 to allow for the mutual recognition of penalty points across the island of Ireland.</p><p>  Steering and working groups, comprising of representatives of the relevant stakeholders in both jurisdictions, have been established to bring the required work forward and decide on how the necessary key deliverables will be achieved legislatively and operationally.  Both groups have met on a number of occasions to date.  </p><p>  To achieve the December 2014 deadline, a significant volume of work will be required, including putting in place the necessary administrative arrangements and IT systems and agreement on data sharing protocols and procedures.  In taking the work forward, complex issues need to be addressed by the two jurisdictions with a view to establishing a workable system which is perceived as proportionate and equitable and which attracts widespread public support throughout the island. </p></reply>

I am, however, concerned about issues that impact on the tourism sector in Ireland and am anxious that the relevant bodies should address these issues.  The Car Rental Council of Ireland is the representative trade organisation for the car rental industry in Ireland.  From time to time, my Department raises matters with the Car Rental Council of Ireland in relation to the manner in which their member companies deal with tourists. </p><p>  The National Consumer Agency, which comes within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is responsible for the enforcement of the Consumer Protection Act 2007. That Act provides for the regulation of quotes or other communications by traders to consumers relating to the price of goods and services, including car rentals.  Consumers who have been subject to misleading or unfair practices by car rental companies may make a complaint to the Agency.     </p><p>  I am also informed by the NCA that under Article 22 of Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights, a trader must seek the express consent of the consumer to any extra payment in addition to the payment agreed upon for the trader&rsquo;s main contractual obligation.  If this express consent is not obtained but has been inferred by using default options which the consumer is required to reject in order to avoid the additional payment, then the consumer shall be entitled to reimbursement of this payment.  I understand that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation intends to enact Regulations giving effect to Article 22 by the end of 2012 or in early 2013.  </p><p>   </p></reply>

Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.  In addition, it was noted that the Irish Government remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole, but that the Government is not in a position to make funding commitments for the period post-2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.  The NSMC plenary approved a funding implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 which incorporated the STG&pound;50m committed by the Irish Government.  The implementation of the project is a matter for the Northern Ireland Road Service.  With regard to the N2 from Clontibret to the Border section of the road, this is a matter for the National Roads Authority.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </p><p>  Given budgetary constraints the NRA will have to operate within the allocations set in the capital expenditure framework for the period to 2016.  Within its capital allocation, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  Unfortunately funding limits mean that the Authority will not be in a position to progress a range of projects over the next number of years.  In the case of this scheme, I understand that it is intended to bring to completion the Route Selection Phase later this year.  However, due to the reduced funding available to the Authority under the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan 2012-2016, the Authority intends to suspend the scheme once the Route Selection Phase is completed.  It is not expected that the NRA will be in a position to proceed to the Design Phase during the period to 2016.</p><p>   </p></reply>

In order to better inform our understanding of the drug driving problem and the options available to tackle it, I asked the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, earlier this year, to undertake a study on roadside drug testing and related matters.  The associated report and its recommendations were published yesterday (17 October).</p><p>  One of the main objectives of the study was to determine whether there are currently available any suitable devices, similar to breathalysers, that can detect and measure the level of drugs in a driver&rsquo;s system.  The Bureau has advised that, while research in the area is continuing, oral fluid is emerging as the specimen of choice for use in roadside chemical drug testing devices.  As a result, I have approved the establishment of a Working Group to consider the issues associated with introducing such devices.  I am advised that, while there is now the potential for a suitable roadside device to be used for the testing of a number of commonly used drugs, there is still no device available for the testing of all drugs.</p><p>  In advance of any technological measures, I also propose to introduce impairment testing for use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in determining whether a driver is incapable, from intoxication, of having proper control of a vehicle.  This testing will consist of simple, physical, cognitive tests such as walking a straight line, tipping one&rsquo;s nose or counting while standing on one leg.  In order to implement this measure, I intend amending a previously uncommenced provision of the 2010 Road Traffic Act for inclusion in the next Road Traffic Bill currently being prepared by my Department.</p><p>  I will examine all the recommendations arising from the Bureau's study and will support any measures aiming to enhance the detection and deterrence of drug driving in this country. </p></reply>

It has engaged with tourism groups, chambers of commerce and local authorities to deliver tourist information services, rationalised its property requirements and where appropriate pursued shared services and activities with Tourism Ireland and other agencies.  </p><p>  Tourism Ireland has also delivered the required efficiency savings for north-south bodies through better procurement and other efficiency programmes. Among the measures undertaken in this regard have been the renegotiation of a number of leases on Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s overseas office network and the securing of better rates for the purchasing of advertising space. </p><p>  More broadly the Government is committed to supporting the tourist industry and last year's Jobs Initiative and the Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2012 recognised the vital contribution of tourism to employment, economic activity and foreign revenue earnings.  For example, the VAT reduction on a range of tourism services from 13.5% to 9% has enhanced the competitiveness of our tourism product.  This lower VAT rate will be maintained until the end of 2013 and represents a substantial resource commitment on the part of the Government.  Furthermore, the Government is funding the biggest ever tourism initiative &quot;The Gathering Ireland 2013&quot; through F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland which it is projected will deliver 325,000 extra visitors next year.</p></reply>

Several European countries have measured the economic importance of sport but each country adopted different definitions of sport, and used different methodologies, and consequently the results were non-comparable. However, there is growing evidence that sport makes a significant contribution to the economy and is an important driver of growth and employment, while also ensuring social cohesion and well-being. According to a recent EU-wide study, sport accounts for 1.76% of overall gross value added in the EU. When multiplier effects are taken into account, the share of sport is 2.98% of overall gross value added in the EU.</p><p>  However, I do not believe relating sports funding to either overall gross national product, or the sub-section of same relating to sports activity is the appropriate mechanism to set the level of state funding for sports.</p><p>  More broadly, an EU Commission study on the financing of grassroots sports in the EU found that financial constraints in the public sector, demographic change and a lack of solidarity between the top and the bottom of the sporting pyramid created a challenging environment for grassroots sport in the future. The study expected a downward trend in revenue from households and private companies (sponsorships, donations) in the short term, and a strong decrease in national budgets for sport.  Because of this downward trend it is important that we create the environment which enables sport to generate its own revenues while at the same time funding sport to the appropriate level that the prevailing economic conditions allow.</p></reply>

Any measures introduced should be evidence based, effective and proportionate, and should have regard to the potential downsides that may occur.</p><p>  A legislative ban on sponsorship would have negative consequences for sport and tourism.  There are huge economic, social and health benefits accruing from sport.  From a health perspective alone, there are clearly significant benefits for individuals and for our health system in maintaining and increasing participation levels in sport. One of the goals of my Department is to contribute to a healthier and more active society by promoting sports participation.  However, it is important that funding is available to sports organisations to ensure that sport is maintained at grassroots level so that as many people as possible can participate.</p><p>  Also, it is my view that sport plays an important role in diverting young people away from alcohol. The financial support provided through sponsorship is integral to the availability of sport at grassroots level and I am concerned that placing constraints on the sporting organisations by eliminating the alcohol industry as a source of sponsorship will have a negative impact on the development and availability of sport, particularly in the current economic climate.  </p><p>  Furthermore, it must be recognised that many of the major sporting events in which Irish teams compete are international events and are directly or indirectly broadcast into the state by foreign broadcasters. Were Ireland to ban alcohol sponsorship, the only effect would be to exclude the Irish sporting organisation from sponsorship money while the advertising occurred anyway. I also note that Britain, having recognised the failure of the 'Loi Evin' in France to reduce alcohol consumption by young people, decided not to ban alcohol sponsorship of sport for evidence based reasons.</p><p>  My Department has engaged with the Department of Health with regard to proposals which that Department is bringing forward. </p></reply>

The &ldquo;Household Travel Survey&rdquo; reports on Irish households&rsquo; travel and tourism, both at home and overseas, and includes details on expenditure, purpose of trip and overnight stays.</p><p>  In addition to using the CSO statistics, the tourism agencies also conduct their own analyses of tourism performance and further research to provide supplementary information and insights.  This includes a range of tourism surveys conducted by F&aacute;ilte Ireland (including the Survey of Overseas Travellers and the Visitor Attitudes Survey) which give further detail on aspects such as visitors&rsquo; motivation for holidaying in Ireland, activities undertaken, destinations visited and accommodation used.  Given the differing demands of agencies, policymakers and industry, and the balance required between quality, standardisation, frequency and relevance of statistics, it is appropriate to use a range of data sources such as these, as well as the official CSO data.</p></reply>

In consideration of these matters, I have consulted with the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications over the past year and it is intended to incorporate their views to a large extent in the General Scheme. In relation to drug testing, I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 20, 24 and 43 today.  I expect that the Bill will be ready for publication at the end of this year or very early in the New Year.  </p></reply>

Fourteen of the thirty largest lessors globally, including nine of the top ten global operators, are based in Ireland and fifty percent of the world's commercial aircraft fleet is managed from Ireland, representing &euro;83bn in assets.  The Government is committed to helping the sector achieve further growth and will continue to work in close collaboration with the industry to ensure that its full potential can be exploited and that Ireland retains its pre-eminent global position in this sector.</p><p>  Ireland was one of the first signatories to the Capetown Convention which is aimed at facilitating the financing of mobile assets, particularly aircraft, and the international registry of mobile assets established under the Convention is operated out of Dublin.  A number of tax initiatives have also been introduced in recent budgets aimed at supporting the leasing and aviation finance industries.  The Government will continue to actively engage with the sector and I will have a direct opportunity to do so at a Conference I am facilitating on 3 December to launch a review process for the development of a new civil aviation policy for Ireland. Many representatives from the leasing industry have been invited to attend and I look forward to discussing with them how the Government can best support continued growth in the industry in Ireland.</p></reply>

The recommendations contained in the Taxi Regulation Review Report, including those relating to improving vehicle standards, reflect the agreement of the Review Group following an extensive consultation process involving the taxi industry and the public at large. The thrust of the reforms outlined in the Review Report will mean better services for consumers and improvements to the operating environment for taxi drivers generally. Any compliance burden impact will be offset by the benefits to taxi operators and to consumers of a better regulated and safer taxi sector.</p><p>  The Group did not make any proposals relating to measures to help taxi drivers source credit for upgrades to vehicles. However the review group proposed, following a consultation process with the sector by the NTA, to allow vehicles licensed before 2009 to ply their trade for up to fourteen years subject to a twice yearly NCT test. This will allow some time for vehicle owners and drivers to adjust to the new regime.</p></reply>

Funding is also being made available for the development of the National Cycle Network, to improve urban, interurban and rural cycling facilities.</p><p>  The NTA has published a comprehensive design manual for the provision of cycle routes which is available at .  Dissemination of best practice and facilitation of appropriate cycle infrastructure design training are also key roles of the Smarter Travel Local Authority Network developed by my Department.

Luas BXD to Broombridge was designed to be a key element in an overall  integrated transport network for Dublin.  It will create a Luas network by joining  the Luas Red and Green Lines and will also link with rail services from Maynooth and Dunboyne and with existing Quality Bus schemes which enter or cross Dublin City Centre.  It will also, in time, interchange with future key projects such as Dart Underground and Metro North.  The project has been prioritised under the Governments's 5-year capital plan - <i>Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 - Medium Term Exchequer Framework - </i>  which was published in November 2011. Funding has been included in my Department's capital allocation to 2016 to cover the cost of commencing the main construction works in 2015 and for  pre-construction enabling works in 2013 and 2014.  Construction is expected to take 4 years.</p><p>  An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la gave approval to the project on 2<sup>nd</sup>   August 2012 and, following the statutory 8-week appeal period, the railway order (RO) is now operational. I understand that the business case for the project is now being updated by the RPA having regard to conditions attached to the RO and other information updates.  There has been extensive engagement between the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) and both Dublin City Council (DCC) and Dublin Bus aimed at minimising the construction impacts of Luas BXD on all road users, including pedestrians, and on businesses in the city centre area.  The ongoing engagement between the relevant agencies on these important issues, which now also includes the NTA, will intensify both prior to and during the construction of the project.</p></reply>

Due to the overall reduction in funding for transport infrastructure the priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards.  The limited funding available over and above this priority will only be provided for projects which are affordable, meet overall transport objectives and deliver the best return in terms of economic recovery and job creation.  Moreover the ability to operate profitably and without the need of any subsidy would also be a key consideration for any new rail projects or extensions. </p><p>  We have no money for new subsidies.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Programme for Government and in particular the commitment that: &quot;We will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value-for-money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period.&quot;   </p><p>  Furthermore, the AECOM/Goodbody &#8220;<i>2030 Rail Network Strategy Review&#8221;</i> carried out for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann examined the potential for new and re-opened lines and it did not recommend the development of a rail link between Sligo and Derry or between Donegal and Derry.  Likewise its predecessor, the &#8220;<i>Strategic Rail Review&#8221;</i> in 2003 did not recommend such rail links.    </p><p>  It should also be noted that the Northern Ireland Executive has no proposals to provide such new rail lines.  For the Deputy's information, Sinn F&eacute;in's recently published Jobs Plan which provides for &quot;&#8364;13 billion additional investment in job creation and economic growth over [the next] four years&quot; does not provide for any investment in these new rail links and services.</p></reply>

Every day it saves lives and builds capacity for the future &ndash; making a real difference in the lives of millions.  The programme is central to our foreign policy, has an enviable international reputation, and consistently enjoys strong political and public support.</p><p>  Our Programme for Government contains a very clear commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, and to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA).  Last month, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, again confirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the aid programme and to reaching the 0.7% UN target as soon as we possibly can.</p><p>  Despite the enormously challenging budgetary environment the Government has managed to maintain Ireland&rsquo;s ODA levels above 0.5% of GNP.  For 2012, the Government has allocated &euro;639 million to ODA which is expected to achieve an ODA/GNP percentage target of 0.51%.  This is an important and significant achievement and a very clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the poor and hungry in the world.  However the 0.7% target can only be achieved with the restoration of sustainable growth in the economy.  This is the Government&rsquo;s absolute priority and we are working extremely hard to achieve this goal.</p><p>  The Government remains ambitious for, and committed to, Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme.  We are determined to maintain and build on its high international reputation, and to ensure that it continues to build the foundation of real change, future prosperity and wellbeing in the lives of many of the world&rsquo;s poorest people.</p></reply>

Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy.</p><p>  I am further advised that Revenue tackles the problem of people working in the shadow economy through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects.  A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre-arranged aspect queries on specific items.  In addition, joint operations are conducted with the Department of Social Protection using Joint Investigation Units.</p><p>  Revenue also has a particular focus on tackling evasion of taxes and duties in the oil and tobacco sectors.  In 2012 to date nine oil laundries have been detected, thirty-eight filling stations have been closed down and over one hundred and fifty-six thousand litres of fuel have been seized from oil laundries.  During 2011 Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service seized a total of 109 million cigarettes in 10,581 seizures.  Commercial quantities in maritime freight traffic accounted for 76.4 million cigarettes.  Revenue also seized 11,158kg of tobacco in 2011.</p><p>  Regarding the amount of money lost to the State each year due to the shadow economy, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that given the nature of the shadow economy there is no reliable system to measure the tax lost.</p><p>  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme, which is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms.  For the year 2011, the Revenue Commissioners secured &euro;440m in additional yield through their audit programmes.  This additional yield includes a significant amount in respect of interest and penalties.  In addition, through its programme of assurance checks for 2011, the Commissioners secured additional yield of &euro;81m.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses.  The following is a summary of the audit results for the year 2011 for a number of sectors:</p><p> - Specific hospitality businesses (bars and restaurants) - 613 audits - Yield &euro;16.9m</p><p> - Professionals (White Collar) &ndash; 543 audits - &euro;14.5m yield</p><p> - Rental &ndash; 908 audits - &euro;35.1m yield.</p><p>  The Deputy should also note that changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting the shadow economy.  Two notable examples are the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalties regime for employers who fail to operate the PAYE regulations fully, both of which came into operation during 2012.</p></reply>

My Department is just one of many who are working to support and encourage business in Ireland, and the following are some examples of how this is being done.  Access to credit is widely regarded as one of the biggest challenges facing businesses in Ireland at present.  The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks achieved their 2011 targets and I would be confident of them achieving the more challenging target this year.  In terms of rejection rates from banks, the Credit Review Office (&lsquo;CRO&rsquo;) can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &euro;1,000 up to &euro;500,000.  The CRO is overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them.</p><p>  My Department also introduced the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act this year and the fund commenced business on 1st October.  This provides for a scheme which will facilitate up to &euro;40 million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  Furthermore, the Government is in the process of facilitating up to &euro;150m per annum of additional credit through the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, designed for small and medium enterprises who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  </p><p>  Further, the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation have taken the lead on a number of measures, including the transposition of Directive 2011/7/EC which has the purpose of establishing a clear legal obligation regarding the timing of payments from debtors.  This mechanism is to improve cashflow for businesses and is deemed to be particularly useful for small businesses.</p><p>  Aside from incentives to support and encourage businesses, there are a number of measures in place to ensure tax compliance for all businesses.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their tax compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focused on ensuring tax compliance.  The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax evasion.</p><p>  In terms of upcoming plans, it is not appropriate to discuss any measures which could form part of Budget 2013, but all of theses issues will feed into our considerations.</p></reply>

Any contribution made by an individual in defraying nursing home expenses on behalf of an individual, where that individual has received State support under section 3 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, otherwise known as the &ldquo;Fair Deal Scheme&rdquo;, is treated as health expenses qualifying for relief.  This relief is given at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax.  The State support contribution towards the cost of such nursing home expenses under this scheme is not treated as a qualifying expense.  Relief is granted to an individual after the end of the tax year by way of a claim made to the Revenue Commissioners by completing a tax return including form Med 1, or through the online services of "ROS" or "PAYE Anytime".</p></reply>

In addition, we will not increase the top marginal rates of taxes on income.  There are no plans at this time to depart from this policy.  I should point out that the top marginal rate of taxation on income is now 52% for PAYE workers and 55% for the self-employed.  The latest OECD data indicates that Ireland has the most progressive tax system of the EU members of its organisation.  A progressive taxation system ensures the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay.  It is estimated that in 2012, the top 5% of income earners will pay 43% of the total income tax, while it is estimated that those earning &euro;50,000 or less, representing 78% of income earners, will pay 20% of the total income tax.  Furthermore, it is estimated that in 2012, 841,100 individuals, representing 39% of the income tax base, will be exempt from income tax.  When marginal rates of tax are very high, jobs are lost.  Indirect taxes have a less adverse impact on employment.  That is why indirect taxes rather than taxes on income were increased in the last budget.  However, that does not mean the wealthy should not carry the principal burden of tax.  The minimum effective tax restriction on high earners is designed to ensure this by imposing a minimum effective income tax rate of 30% for those subject to the full restriction, in addition to 4% in PRSI and up to 10% in the USC.</p></reply>

However, RCT applies to all construction works ranging from major construction projects to general repair works.  Repair work includes the replacement of constituent parts of a building or structure, for example, the repair of a broken window.  Maintenance, on the other hand, includes cleaning, removal of graffiti and the unblocking of drains, etc.  In the light of the difficulty some school boards of management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT system, the Revenue Commissioners have made available detailed guidance notes specifically tailored for boards of management regarding the operation of RCT.  These guidance notes, which clarify the position in relation to repair work and maintenance work, have been published on the Revenue website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.  The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school boards of management and other principal contractors.  RCT plays an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to introduce a threshold for this type of work.  From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of RCT following the introduction of a dedicated online facility which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper-free system.  This has significantly reduced the administrative burden associated with RCT.  Finally, having regard to the pressures on the public finances, it is important that the RCT system is implemented correctly to minimise tax evasion in the construction sector, particularly where the project involves substantial State funding.  The new online system introduced by Revenue has significantly simplified the RCT process for principal contractors, including school boards of management.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners the "remittance basis of taxation" means, in brief, that apart from employment income, foreign income and foreign capital gains are chargeable to Irish tax only when remitted to the State.  With regard to employment income, where an individual who is tax resident but not domiciled in the State holds a foreign employment, the "remittance basis" of taxation is available to him or her in respect of that proportion of the income attributable to the performance outside the State of the duties of that foreign employment.  The remittance basis is not available in respect of that proportion of the income attributable to the performance in the State of the duties of that foreign employment.</p><p>  As there is no statutory obligation on those availing of the remittance basis of taxation to make an annual return of their un-remitted income and gains, it is not possible to quantify or estimate the amount of tax yield to be gained from the abolition of the remittance basis of taxation.</p></reply>

For companies whose current expenditure on R&amp;D does not exceed their 2003 expenditure, no credit is due and information in relation to R&amp;D expenditure in both the base year or current year are not required or entered on the corporation tax return and is consequently not available.  Based solely on the companies with positive claims for R&amp;D tax credits in their 2010 corporation tax returns, the full year cost of abolishing the base year is tentatively estimated to be in the region of &euro;45m.  However, caution should be exercised with regard to this figure as the full cost of abolishing the base year would additionally include companies whose current R&amp;D expenditure does not exceed their 2003 base year spend.  As already stated, the Revenue Commissioners do not have access to this additional information.

An authorised dealer is a person who is authorised under section 136 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) &#8220;<i>to manufacture, distribute, deal in, deliver, store, repair or modify unregistered vehicles and to convert registered vehicles</i>&#8221;.  Authorisation brings a number of responsibilities concerning the management and record keeping in relation to vehicles, responsibilities that are subject to control and scrutiny by the Commissioners.  Because of the significant amount of relief from both VRT and VAT available to purchasers of vehicles under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers scheme, it is appropriate that vehicles provided under this scheme should be provided by authorised dealers to facilitate the monitoring of various elements of the scheme. </p><p>  It is not possible to avail of the scheme if a vehicle was purchased privately.

In the interim, temporary accommodation was sanctioned for the school to meet the 2012/13 accommodation needs.</p><p>  In the case of the two remaining post primary schools in Balbriggan listed by the Deputy, one has just had a major extension completed to cater for existing enrolment (approx 1,185) and the other has been included in the 5 year Capital Investment Programme to commence construction in 2014/15 that will expand the schools capacity to 1,000 pupils.</p><p>  In addition, the Deputy may also be aware that one of the new post primary schools that I announced in June 2011 to be established nationally will be provided in Balbriggan in 2014. In July 2012 I announced further post primary schools to be established including an English medium school in Balbriggan post 2015.</p><p>  In 2008, recognition was granted to a new Community College in Donabate that resulted in a new 1,000 pupil school building being completed for the 2011/12 academic year. Enrolments in the school have increased from 100 pupils in 2008 to 586 pupils in 2012/13 with 143 first year pupils enrolled in September 2012. The school has capacity for at least 180 first year pupils.</p><p>  With regard to post primary provision in Swords, there are over 2,400 post primary places provided in the four schools listed by the Deputy. An extension to one of those schools to provide an additional 400 places for the area was announced earlier this year as part of the 5 year Capital Investment Programme.</p><p>  In relation to the school in Rush, my Department approved funding earlier this year to relocate and refurbish temporary accommodation to meet the schools 2012/13 accommodation needs. A new 1,000 pupil post primary school to be located in Lusk was announced earlier this year and is due to commence operation in 2013.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my priority is to ensure that there is sufficient school accommodation to meet projected pupil enrolment increases into the future. The 5 year Capital Investment Programme that I announced earlier this year was part of a &euro;2 billion Capital Investment Programme which outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Programme. In addition, my Department will consider applications by schools for funding for additional classrooms, which schools may provide on a permanent basis, where an immediate enrolment need is arising.</p><p>  The current status of all projects on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my  Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the  staffing resources available to my Department. <br />  There are 10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts available for allocation  in the 2012/13 school year which is the same number of posts which were  available for allocation for the 2011/12 school year. The NCSE has notified  schools of their SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid  applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.  <br />  To date the NCSE has allocated 10,311 WTE SNA posts to schools. Every child who  meets the criteria for access to SNA support in the current school year is in  receipt of this support. This leaves 264 posts available for allocation  throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or  emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme.  The NCSE have estimated that based on the experience of last year, that it is  estimated that these 264 posts should be sufficient to meet demand during the  school year.  <br />Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were  not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year  were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot  cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support  which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA  support or for a review of their SNA allocation.  <br />  The specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of SNAs allocated for 1997 to 2011 is provided in the attached table.  <br />Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that this Government has demonstrated its  commitment to protecting services for children with special educational needs  by maintaining the overall number of SNA posts which will be available for  allocation to schools for the 2012/13 school year, at a time when there has  been a requirement to make savings across a range of expenditure areas.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Special Needs Assistants 1997 - 2011</th></tr><tr><td>*1997</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>*1998</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>*1999</td><td>558</td></tr><tr><td>*2000</td><td>1495</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>2988</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>4979</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>5367</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>5869</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>7294</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>8390</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>9824</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>10,442</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>10,342</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>10,543</td></tr><tr><td>**2011</td><td>10,117           (10,320)</td></tr></table></p><p>* SNA data from 1997 &ndash; 2011 relates to Primary and Special Schools only.</p><p>** Total number of SNA posts approved by the NCSE for the 2011/12 school year was 10,320.

It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. I am confident schools will act in the best interest of students. I acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools is challenging for schools. However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation, the alternative to which was to make an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule, must be seen in the context of our very difficult budgetary constraints. As part of the budgetary measure my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation.</p></reply>

At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. <br />My Department provides funding to Community and Comprehensive schools on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school etc. <br />With regard to the VEC sector financial allocations are made to VECs as part of a block grant. VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and each is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. <br />My Department provides funding to voluntary secondary schools by way of per capita grants. <br />Fee charging schools do not receive any capitation or related grants from my Department.<br />Information going back to 1997, as requested by the Deputy, is not readily available.

I have submitted the detailed General Scheme of a Freedom of Information Reform Bill to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for its views and recommendations.  I believe that the Committee can on its own account and drawing on the perspectives, experience and expertise of a broader range of relevant parties make a very significant contribution  to the further development and refinement of these important legislative proposals. I expect to be in a position to publish the Freedom of Information Bill following careful consideration of the views to be furnished by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the legislative proposals and the drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel in due course.</p></reply>

The Authority has workplace inspection programmes in place, and insofar as a sports club would be a workplace such clubs would be liable to inspection under health and safety legislation.  </p><p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 places a responsibility on all employers to ensure the safety, health and welfare at work of their employees. In meeting this responsibility, employers must identify hazards at the place of work and carry out an assessment of the risk presented by any such hazards.  Following a review of this assessment the employer is required to implement appropriate steps to bring about any necessary improvement to the safety, health and welfare at work of their employees.</p><p>  In relation to chemicals such as lime or petroleum products, there are no specific occupational health and safety Regulations that provide for the prohibition of such chemicals.   However, health and safety information on chemicals can be found on product labels in line with the EU&#8217;s Classification, Labelling and Packaging of chemicals Regulation (1272/2008). Under that Regulation, if the chemicals are classified as hazardous, then a Safety Data Sheet must be provided to professional users at work and must be prepared in a format set out in the EU &#8220;REACH&#8221; Regulation (1907/2006). </p><p>  &#8220;REACH&#8221; provides for the uses of some hazardous chemicals to be prohibited or restricted across Europe so as to protect human health and the environment.

I understand from IDA Ireland that, depending on the size and scale of the project, the lead in time from first engagement to job announcement can vary from 12 months upwards.  A number of factors have an impact on this timeframe.  For example, a large multinational may require its own board approval for large investment whereas a smaller emerging business/ financial service company may not.  The sector and business activity can also have an impact.  With Pharmaceutical/Medical Technology companies or large ICT companies, a fit out or new build may be required.  Finally, deciding on a location can also be a contributory factor.  Normally a company is shown three or four selected towns which could meet its requirements for skills, labour, site and/or buildings, infrastructure, etc. and while IDA Ireland will seek to influence the selection of location, the final decision on the location of and the announcement to proceed with the project is taken in all cases by the promoting company.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-18a.396.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101800054#WRP01100"><p>The Employment Appeals Tribunal is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and I have no direct involvement in its day to day operations.  The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&#8217;s recommendation/decision.  The Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably this has had the unfortunate consequence of increasing the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard.  All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgement with the Tribunal.</p><p>  Despite the significant increase in the volume of claims, the Tribunal has been pro-active in seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency. As part of the drive for efficiencies the Tribunal streams cases, of similar types where possible or where the parties are the same.  These efficiencies have resulted in quicker turnover and improvements to the service provided and delivered significant increases in output and the number of cases disposed of, in 2010 (+30%), 2011 (+11%) and a further marked increase to date in 2012.  The number of claims awaiting hearing at the end of Q3 2012 is 4,311. There has been a continued reduction in the number of claims awaiting hearing since Q1 2011. However, of the total number of claims received by the Tribunal, approximately 25% to 35% of these claims are Unfair Dismissal claims.  Due to the contested nature of unfair dismissal cases, a very significant but varying amount of the Tribunal&#8217;s time is given to these hearings.</p><p>  I am informed that the waiting periods at the end of September 2012, ranged from 9 weeks to 94 weeks.  The reason for the variance in these waiting times is because the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 36 locations. Where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases are on hand so as to maximise value for money.  Once a critical mass of hearings is assembled, 5 days of hearing in a single location can reduce the waiting time in the area concerned significantly. I have asked the Tribunal to examine if further efficiencies can be achieved through rationalizing their hearing venues.  Delays are also impacted upon by the number of postponement or adjournment applications made by either party.  I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding; using the resources it has currently available.  The Tribunal is actively working to meet this challenge, notwithstanding the high level of claims in recent years and the administrative resources available.</p><p>  I believe it is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  When I came into office last year I inherited a system for resolving employment disputes that did not achieve this.  The system was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT and others to reduce backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.</p><p>  It is for these reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform programme I have commenced will deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations structure. I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p><p>  The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court will be merged into the new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the EAT, to significantly improve the quality of service to users including a reduction in waiting times.</p><p>  Since I announced my reform proposals we have undertaken two public consultation processes; published two policy documents; published a new website; introduced a single complaint form and single contact portal and commenced delivery of an Early Resolution Service.  In addition we have prepared the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill and secured Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill. </p><p>  Significant progress has been made to date which means we now have:<blockquote>- A new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; dealing with all Workplace Relations complaints which has replaced the five separate entry points.<br /><br />- Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.<br /><br />- The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing. Again this was taking up to eight months<br /><br />- There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.<br /><br />- A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<br /><br />- A new workplace relations interim website www.workplacerelations.ie is in place.<br /><br />- A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.</blockquote>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results so far.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.</p><p>  The State plays a major role in the private rental market through the rent supplement scheme.  As the Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions.  Revised maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  Any price differential between North and South Tipperary was based on the analysis of their respective local rental markets.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p><p>  Analysis of the rental market shows that for both North Tipperary and South Tipperary there are properties available for rent supplement recipients.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no immediate plans to revise the existing rent limits.  The next review of rent limits will take place before June 2013 and any changes to the limits in Tipperary will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 16,000 mortgage interest supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;51 million for in 2012.  From 18 June 2012, applicants for MIS must comply with an alternative payment arrangement agreed with their lender for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months prior to becoming eligible for the scheme.  The underlying principle of this legislative change is to ensure that MIS eligibility criteria reflect the forbearance arrangements set out in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). Part of the MIS eligibility criteria includes the provision of written evidence that applicants have engaged with his/her mortgage service provider under the MARP.</p><p>  There are standard controls which form part of the day-to-day administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  This includes a number of operational controls in place to ensure that payment of mortgage interest supplement does not continue to those who no longer have an entitlement such as regular review of claims.  These reviews include the provision of information by the claimant and a statement on the current position of the mortgage from the mortgage provider. In addition warning reports are issued to officers where there is a change in circumstances which would prompt a review of entitlement.  The delivery of services and control related functions in relation to processing MIS applications is subject to on-going review.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two involve the enhancement of the website  and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the lenders.  The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence.</p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  This framework will be reviewed in June 2013.</p><p>  The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service.  Accountants, with practising certificates who want to be involved, need to indicate to their relevant accounting bodies their wish to participate in the service.  To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are now listed on  on a county by county basis.</p></reply>

To this end it put in place the first phase of the Exemplar programme, a test bed facility based on one such new and advanced Irish technology - Optical Packet Switching and Transport (OPST) from Intune Networks.  This facility has been available for the development and testing of next generation services and has been accessible though the HEAnet academic network in Ireland, and via this to academic networks and their users elsewhere in Europe.  The Test-bed has 14 industry partners and 8 academic research partners and has led to the creation of 50<b></b>new jobs in Ireland.</p><p>  Under phase II of the Exemplar programme, my Department is examining whether a research support platform, involving academic and industry researchers and including the OPST and other publicly funded research facilities, would stimulate increased cross-organisational research, formalise existing support mechanisms and provide a basis for better researcher-to-researcher networking in developing innovative ICT products and services.  These might include Big Data services, analytics services and new cloud support services.  My Department is also in discussions with HEAnet, in this context, with a view to using its extensive network to widen access to the test-bed.  Phase 3 of the Exemplar Programme envisioned the development of a national smart communications infrastructure.  The scale, scope, and breadth of this phase of the Exemplar programme will need to be set by private investors/funders.</p></reply>

Ireland is fully compliant with its European Union (EU) obligation to hold 90 days supply of category one, category two and category three oil products for use in the event of an oil supply disruption.</p><p>  Ireland is also fully compliant with its International Energy Agency (IEA) obligation to maintain 90 days of oil stocks.  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) was established to ensure that Ireland meets its EU and IEA oil stockholding obligations.  In 2012, under IEA methodology, NORA is required to hold 75 days of Ireland&#8217;s 90 day stockholding requirements, the balance of which is held by industry.</p><p>  NORA meets its stock-holding obligations by a combination of wholly-owned stocks and stock &#8220;tickets&#8221; (short term contracts to purchase oil in the event of an oil supply disruption).</p><p>  Of the stocks currently held by NORA, approximately 66% are held as physical stocks on the island of Ireland, 33% are held as physical stocks abroad, and 2% are held as stock tickets.</p><p>  All industry stocks are held as physical stocks within the State.</p><p>  It is Government policy to increase the volume of strategic stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.  In 2011, NORA commissioned two new storage facilities at Ringsend, in Dublin and Kilroot, in County Antrim.  In addition, the refurbishment of an existing facility at Tarbert Power Station, County Kerry is at an advanced stage.  This additional storage capacity will considerably enhance oil security on the Island of Ireland.</p><p>  The costs of maintaining the strategic stocks held by NORA are outlined in the NORA annual financial statements, which are published on the website .  The costs vary from year to year depending on the obligation level set for NORA which in turn depends upon the level of oil consumption in the State.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding and its operations are funded by a levy imposed on the disposal of oil products which is currently 2 cents per litre and by borrowings from commercial banks.  The levy rate is reviewed from time to time and was increased from 1 cent per litre to the current rate of 2 cents per litre with effect from October, 2009.  I have no plans to amend the current rate.</p><p>  Ireland, through its membership of the IEA has access to the latter&#8217;s oil market analysis, and as such my Department does not undertake independent projections or forecasts of future oil prices.  Volatility in global oil prices underscores the Government&#8217;s ongoing commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported carbon intensive fossil fuels.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.  Business and domestic customers can now avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.</p><p>  With regard to gas, up until 1 October 2011 the CER has regulated the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  I have no function in the matter.</p><p>  For Bord G&aacute;is Energy&rsquo;s residential tariffs, the allowed revenue is examined twice yearly.  These examinations set the BG Energy tariffs for the following six months of the gas year.  To set the prices that BG Energy may charge customers, the CER first determines the revenue that BG Energy needs to earn to meet costs efficiently.  These costs include the cost of buying wholesale gas, transportation, BG Energy's own supply cost, profit margin and capital expenditure.  The most recent Gas Tariff Review (CER/12/146) was published on 4 September 2012.</p><p>  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers. Ireland is however a price taker for gas.</p><p>  The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy is charged to all electricity customers.  It is designed to support the national policy objectives of security of energy supply, the use of indigenous fuels (i.e. peat) and the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation, as set out in legislation. The proceeds of the levy are used to recoup, inter alia, the additional costs incurred by electricity suppliers in sourcing, and ESB Power Generation producing, a proportion of their electricity from such generators.</p><p>  Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 sets out the legal basis for the PSO levy in Ireland.  Statutory Instrument No. 217 of 2002 made under Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act requires that the CER calculates and certifies the costs associated with the PSO and sets the associated levy for the required period.  The PSO levy takes into account the estimated and actual costs incurred in undertaking generation activities which are covered in the relevant PSO legislation. Articles 8 and 9 of Statutory Instrument 217 of 2002 set out the methodology of the calculation of the components of the PSO levy and the estimation of the amount of the PSO levy by the CER.</p></reply>

Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time. </p><p>  Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &ndash; 2013 was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme. No proposal for the Castleisland Sewerage Scheme was received from Kerry County Council in response to the review process.</p></reply>

Circular HMS 05/2003, as updated by Circular HMS 06 and 06A/2003, outlined the operation of the Scheme, including details in respect of repayment calculation on the mortgage and rental elements of such loans. </p><p>Under the scheme the rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.Local authority mortgage holders &ndash; including those who purchased under shared ownership &ndash; also benefit from extremely keenly priced interest rates which currently stand at around 1.5% below average variable rates available in the market. This is a very substantial differential.</p><p>  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude later in the year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.</p></reply>

One of the conditions of the Plan, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.</p><p>  The provision requiring that mortgage protection insurance is held by mortgage holders is contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995. This legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>  Compared with other schemes of mortgage protection, the local authority scheme covers disability as well as death, and the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available.</p><p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee seeks to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided. In negotiating a renewal of the scheme, which came into effect from 1 January 2012, the Committee was able to harness the downward pressure on pricing in the economy and secure an average 19% reduction on the rate which applied to the previous scheme.</p></reply>

My Department has been working with the main health insurers and has agreed in principle a system of improved cash-flow and accelerated payments, which will provide a once-off cash flow benefit in 2012 in the region of &euro;125m for the health system.  The detailed arrangements for the accelerated payments are being finalised with the health insurers at present.</p><p>  The HSE is continuing a drive to reduce the time taken to submit claims to private health insurance companies. A key element in this drive includes the implementation of an electronic claims management system in its hospitals. This system will address the deficiencies of the paper based process and will also ensure that standardised work practices are implemented across hospitals.</p></reply>

The level of funding available for the health budget and the extent of the savings required in the health sector is being considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2013 which is currently underway. Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.</p></reply>

Animal-drawn vehicles are bound by road traffic legislation, as are all vehicles used on public roads.  If used properly and in accordance with the legislation they should not pose a danger to other road users.  I do not believe that it would be proportionate to ban any particular category of vehicle from the roads  because some very reckless individuals have used them in ways which are illegal.     </p><p>  It is of course a matter of concern when vehicles are used improperly.  In particular, there can be no question of using public roads for races with sulkies or any other kind of vehicle, except in circumstances where sections of public road are temporarily closed to regular traffic by the relevant authorities for the purposes of legitimate sporting events.  I am however satisfied that the Garda have sufficient power under current legislation to intervene in cases where people using sulkies, or any other kind of vehicle, are acting illegally, whether by racing or in any other way.</p></reply>

The price cap set by CAR for this year is &euro;10.76 but the DAA has, however, kept the headline charge at the 2011 rate of &euro;10.43 which is 3.2 % below the cap for 2012. </p><p>  A published study of airport charges conducted in 2010 by the Airports Council International (ACI) found that Dublin Airport's charges were in the middle range of comparable metropolitan airports in Europe.  A cost comparative exercise would be beneficial but difficult, as the data needed is commercially sensitive and not readily available.</p><p>  The Jobs Initiative launched by the Government last year includes a three-pronged strategy to encourage inbound tourism.  One element of this is the introduction of a new growth incentive scheme by the DAA at the three State airports.</p><p>  This scheme which is due to run until 2014 was designed to encourage growth in passenger numbers.  Earlier this year, DAA paid a rebate of &euro;1.5 million to the 30 airlines that grew their business from Dublin last year.  </p></reply>

For companies whose current expenditure on R&amp;D does not exceed their 2003 expenditure, no credit is due and information in relation to R&amp;D expenditure in both the base year or current year are not required or entered on the corporation tax return and is consequently not available.  Based solely on the companies with positive claims for R&amp;D tax credits in their 2010 corporation tax returns, the full year cost of abolishing the base year is tentatively estimated to be in the region of &euro;45m.  However, caution should be exercised with regard to this figure as the full cost of abolishing the base year would additionally include companies whose current R&amp;D expenditure does not exceed their 2003 base year spend.  As already stated, the Revenue Commissioners do not have access to this additional information.  Further, given that companies who have never claimed the credit are likely to have a high 2003 base year spend, which explains why they have never been able to claim the credit, the additional cost arising may be significant.</p><p>  Taking all of these factors into consideration, the cost is likely to be greater than &euro;45 million and possibly significantly so.</p></reply>

Because of the significant amount of relief from both VRT and VAT available to purchasers of vehicles under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers scheme, it is appropriate that vehicles provided under this scheme should be provided by authorised dealers to facilitate the monitoring of various elements of the scheme. </p><p>  It is not possible to avail of the scheme if a vehicle was purchased privately.  I have no plans to change the eligibility rules at present.</p></reply>

Phase I of this school's permanent building, catering for 350 pupils, was delivered in 2010 and phase II, catering for 650 pupils, is proceeding to construction shortly. Enrolments have increased from 66 pupils in 2009 to 408 pupils in 2012/13 with 121 first year pupils enrolled in September 2012. The school will have capacity for at least 180 first year pupils once phase II of the permanent building is delivered. In the interim, temporary accommodation was sanctioned for the school to meet the 2012/13 accommodation needs.</p><p>  In the case of the two remaining post primary schools in Balbriggan listed by the Deputy, one has just had a major extension completed to cater for existing enrolment (approx 1,185) and the other has been included in the 5 year Capital Investment Programme to commence construction in 2014/15 that will expand the schools capacity to 1,000 pupils.</p><p>  In addition, the Deputy may also be aware that one of the new post primary schools that I announced in June 2011 to be established nationally will be provided in Balbriggan in 2014. In July 2012 I announced further post primary schools to be established including an English medium school in Balbriggan post 2015.</p><p>  In 2008, recognition was granted to a new Community College in Donabate that resulted in a new 1,000 pupil school building being completed for the 2011/12 academic year. Enrolments in the school have increased from 100 pupils in 2008 to 586 pupils in 2012/13 with 143 first year pupils enrolled in September 2012. The school has capacity for at least 180 first year pupils.</p><p>  With regard to post primary provision in Swords, there are over 2,400 post primary places provided in the four schools listed by the Deputy. An extension to one of those schools to provide an additional 400 places for the area was announced earlier this year as part of the 5 year Capital Investment Programme.</p><p>  In relation to the school in Rush, my Department approved funding earlier this year to relocate and refurbish temporary accommodation to meet the schools 2012/13 accommodation needs. A new 1,000 pupil post primary school to be located in Lusk was announced earlier this year and is due to commence operation in 2013.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my priority is to ensure that there is sufficient school accommodation to meet projected pupil enrolment increases into the future. The 5 year Capital Investment Programme that I announced earlier this year was part of a &euro;2 billion Capital Investment Programme which outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Programme. In addition, my Department will consider applications by schools for funding for additional classrooms, which schools may provide on a permanent basis, where an immediate enrolment need is arising.</p><p>  The current status of all projects on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my  Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the  staffing resources available to my Department. <br />  There are 10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts available for allocation  in the 2012/13 school year which is the same number of posts which were  available for allocation for the 2011/12 school year. The NCSE has notified  schools of their SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid  applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.  <br />  To date the NCSE has allocated 10,311 WTE SNA posts to schools. Every child who  meets the criteria for access to SNA support in the current school year is in  receipt of this support. This leaves 264 posts available for allocation  throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or  emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme.  The NCSE have estimated that based on the experience of last year, that it is  estimated that these 264 posts should be sufficient to meet demand during the  school year.  <br />Where schools have enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were  not considered at the time that the allocations for the 2012/13 school year  were made, or where schools are in a position to demonstrate that they cannot  cater for the care needs of qualifying children from the level of SNA support  which has been assigned to them, they may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA  support or for a review of their SNA allocation.  <br />  The specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of SNAs allocated for 1997 to 2011 is provided in the attached table.  <br />Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that this Government has demonstrated its  commitment to protecting services for children with special educational needs  by maintaining the overall number of SNA posts which will be available for  allocation to schools for the 2012/13 school year, at a time when there has  been a requirement to make savings across a range of expenditure areas.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Special Needs Assistants 1997 - 2011</th></tr><tr><td>*1997</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>*1998</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>*1999</td><td>558</td></tr><tr><td>*2000</td><td>1495</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>2988</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>4979</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>5367</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>5869</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>7294</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>8390</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>9824</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>10,442</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>10,342</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>10,543</td></tr><tr><td>**2011</td><td>10,117           (10,320)</td></tr></table></p><p>* SNA data from 1997 &ndash; 2011 relates to Primary and Special Schools only.</p><p>** Total number of SNA posts approved by the NCSE for the 2011/12 school year was 10,320.

It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. I am confident schools will act in the best interest of students. I acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools is challenging for schools. However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation, the alternative to which was to make an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule, must be seen in the context of our very difficult budgetary constraints. As part of the budgetary measure my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation.</p></reply>

At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. <br />My Department provides funding to Community and Comprehensive schools on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school etc. <br />With regard to the VEC sector financial allocations are made to VECs as part of a block grant. VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and each is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. <br />My Department provides funding to voluntary secondary schools by way of per capita grants. <br />Fee charging schools do not receive any capitation or related grants from my Department.<br />Information going back to 1997, as requested by the Deputy, is not readily available.

I have submitted the detailed General Scheme of a Freedom of Information Reform Bill to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for its views and recommendations.  I believe that the Committee can on its own account and drawing on the perspectives, experience and expertise of a broader range of relevant parties make a very significant contribution  to the further development and refinement of these important legislative proposals. I expect to be in a position to publish the Freedom of Information Bill following careful consideration of the views to be furnished by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the legislative proposals and the drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel in due course.</p></reply>

The Authority has workplace inspection programmes in place, and insofar as a sports club would be a workplace such clubs would be liable to inspection under health and safety legislation.  </p><p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 places a responsibility on all employers to ensure the safety, health and welfare at work of their employees. In meeting this responsibility, employers must identify hazards at the place of work and carry out an assessment of the risk presented by any such hazards.  Following a review of this assessment the employer is required to implement appropriate steps to bring about any necessary improvement to the safety, health and welfare at work of their employees.</p><p>  In relation to chemicals such as lime or petroleum products, there are no specific occupational health and safety Regulations that provide for the prohibition of such chemicals.   However, health and safety information on chemicals can be found on product labels in line with the EU&#8217;s Classification, Labelling and Packaging of chemicals Regulation (1272/2008). Under that Regulation, if the chemicals are classified as hazardous, then a Safety Data Sheet must be provided to professional users at work and must be prepared in a format set out in the EU &#8220;REACH&#8221; Regulation (1907/2006). </p><p>  &#8220;REACH&#8221; provides for the uses of some hazardous chemicals to be prohibited or restricted across Europe so as to protect human health and the environment.

I understand from IDA Ireland that, depending on the size and scale of the project, the lead in time from first engagement to job announcement can vary from 12 months upwards.  A number of factors have an impact on this timeframe.  For example, a large multinational may require its own board approval for large investment whereas a smaller emerging business/ financial service company may not.  The sector and business activity can also have an impact.  With Pharmaceutical/Medical Technology companies or large ICT companies, a fit out or new build may be required.  Finally, deciding on a location can also be a contributory factor.  Normally a company is shown three or four selected towns which could meet its requirements for skills, labour, site and/or buildings, infrastructure, etc. and while IDA Ireland will seek to influence the selection of location, the final decision on the location of and the announcement to proceed with the project is taken in all cases by the promoting company.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-18a.825.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101800060#WRP01100"><p>The Employment Appeals Tribunal is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and I have no direct involvement in its day to day operations.  The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&#8217;s recommendation/decision.  The Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably this has had the unfortunate consequence of increasing the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard.  All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgement with the Tribunal.</p><p>  Despite the significant increase in the volume of claims, the Tribunal has been pro-active in seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency. As part of the drive for efficiencies the Tribunal streams cases, of similar types where possible or where the parties are the same.  These efficiencies have resulted in quicker turnover and improvements to the service provided and delivered significant increases in output and the number of cases disposed of, in 2010 (+30%), 2011 (+11%) and a further marked increase to date in 2012.  The number of claims awaiting hearing at the end of Q3 2012 is 4,311. There has been a continued reduction in the number of claims awaiting hearing since Q1 2011. However, of the total number of claims received by the Tribunal, approximately 25% to 35% of these claims are Unfair Dismissal claims.  Due to the contested nature of unfair dismissal cases, a very significant but varying amount of the Tribunal&#8217;s time is given to these hearings.</p><p>  I am informed that the waiting periods at the end of September 2012, ranged from 9 weeks to 94 weeks.  The reason for the variance in these waiting times is because the Tribunal conducts hearings in about 36 locations. Where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases are on hand so as to maximise value for money.  Once a critical mass of hearings is assembled, 5 days of hearing in a single location can reduce the waiting time in the area concerned significantly. I have asked the Tribunal to examine if further efficiencies can be achieved through rationalizing their hearing venues.  Delays are also impacted upon by the number of postponement or adjournment applications made by either party.  I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding; using the resources it has currently available.  The Tribunal is actively working to meet this challenge, notwithstanding the high level of claims in recent years and the administrative resources available.</p><p>  I believe it is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  When I came into office last year I inherited a system for resolving employment disputes that did not achieve this.  The system was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT and others to reduce backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.</p><p>  It is for these reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform programme I have commenced will deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations structure. I propose to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p><p>  The activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court will be merged into the new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the EAT, to significantly improve the quality of service to users including a reduction in waiting times.</p><p>  Since I announced my reform proposals we have undertaken two public consultation processes; published two policy documents; published a new website; introduced a single complaint form and single contact portal and commenced delivery of an Early Resolution Service.  In addition we have prepared the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill and secured Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill. </p><p>  Significant progress has been made to date which means we now have:<blockquote>- A new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; dealing with all Workplace Relations complaints which has replaced the five separate entry points.<br /><br />- Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.<br /><br />- The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing. Again this was taking up to eight months<br /><br />- There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.<br /><br />- A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<br /><br />- A new workplace relations interim website www.workplacerelations.ie is in place.<br /><br />- A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.</blockquote>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results so far.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.</p><p>  The State plays a major role in the private rental market through the rent supplement scheme.  As the Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions.  Revised maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  Any price differential between North and South Tipperary was based on the analysis of their respective local rental markets.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p><p>  Analysis of the rental market shows that for both North Tipperary and South Tipperary there are properties available for rent supplement recipients.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no immediate plans to revise the existing rent limits.  The next review of rent limits will take place before June 2013 and any changes to the limits in Tipperary will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 16,000 mortgage interest supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;51 million for in 2012.  From 18 June 2012, applicants for MIS must comply with an alternative payment arrangement agreed with their lender for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months prior to becoming eligible for the scheme.  The underlying principle of this legislative change is to ensure that MIS eligibility criteria reflect the forbearance arrangements set out in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). Part of the MIS eligibility criteria includes the provision of written evidence that applicants have engaged with his/her mortgage service provider under the MARP.</p><p>  There are standard controls which form part of the day-to-day administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  This includes a number of operational controls in place to ensure that payment of mortgage interest supplement does not continue to those who no longer have an entitlement such as regular review of claims.  These reviews include the provision of information by the claimant and a statement on the current position of the mortgage from the mortgage provider. In addition warning reports are issued to officers where there is a change in circumstances which would prompt a review of entitlement.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two involve the enhancement of the website  and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the lenders.  The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence.</p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  This framework will be reviewed in June 2013.</p><p>  The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service.  Accountants, with practising certificates who want to be involved, need to indicate to their relevant accounting bodies their wish to participate in the service.  To date, some 2,700 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are now listed on  on a county by county basis.</p></reply>

To this end it put in place the first phase of the Exemplar programme, a test bed facility based on one such new and advanced Irish technology - Optical Packet Switching and Transport (OPST) from Intune Networks.  This facility has been available for the development and testing of next generation services and has been accessible though the HEAnet academic network in Ireland, and via this to academic networks and their users elsewhere in Europe.  The Test-bed has 14 industry partners and 8 academic research partners and has led to the creation of 50<b></b>new jobs in Ireland.</p><p>  Under phase II of the Exemplar programme, my Department is examining whether a research support platform, involving academic and industry researchers and including the OPST and other publicly funded research facilities, would stimulate increased cross-organisational research, formalise existing support mechanisms and provide a basis for better researcher-to-researcher networking in developing innovative ICT products and services.  These might include Big Data services, analytics services and new cloud support services.  My Department is also in discussions with HEAnet, in this context, with a view to using its extensive network to widen access to the test-bed.  Phase 3 of the Exemplar Programme envisioned the development of a national smart communications infrastructure.  The scale, scope, and breadth of this phase of the Exemplar programme will need to be set by private investors/funders.</p></reply>

Ireland is fully compliant with its European Union (EU) obligation to hold 90 days supply of category one, category two and category three oil products for use in the event of an oil supply disruption.</p><p>  Ireland is also fully compliant with its International Energy Agency (IEA) obligation to maintain 90 days of oil stocks.  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) was established to ensure that Ireland meets its EU and IEA oil stockholding obligations.  In 2012, under IEA methodology, NORA is required to hold 75 days of Ireland&#8217;s 90 day stockholding requirements, the balance of which is held by industry.</p><p>  NORA meets its stock-holding obligations by a combination of wholly-owned stocks and stock &#8220;tickets&#8221; (short term contracts to purchase oil in the event of an oil supply disruption).</p><p>  Of the stocks currently held by NORA, approximately 66% are held as physical stocks on the island of Ireland, 33% are held as physical stocks abroad, and 2% are held as stock tickets.</p><p>  All industry stocks are held as physical stocks within the State.</p><p>  It is Government policy to increase the volume of strategic stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.  In 2011, NORA commissioned two new storage facilities at Ringsend, in Dublin and Kilroot, in County Antrim.  In addition, the refurbishment of an existing facility at Tarbert Power Station, County Kerry is at an advanced stage.  This additional storage capacity will considerably enhance oil security on the Island of Ireland.</p><p>  The costs of maintaining the strategic stocks held by NORA are outlined in the NORA annual financial statements, which are published on the website .  The costs vary from year to year depending on the obligation level set for NORA which in turn depends upon the level of oil consumption in the State.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding and its operations are funded by a levy imposed on the disposal of oil products which is currently 2 cents per litre and by borrowings from commercial banks.  The levy rate is reviewed from time to time and was increased from 1 cent per litre to the current rate of 2 cents per litre with effect from October, 2009.  I have no plans to amend the current rate.</p><p>  Ireland, through its membership of the IEA has access to the latter&#8217;s oil market analysis, and as such my Department does not undertake independent projections or forecasts of future oil prices.  Volatility in global oil prices underscores the Government&#8217;s ongoing commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported carbon intensive fossil fuels.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.  Business and domestic customers can now avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.</p><p>  With regard to gas, up until 1 October 2011 the CER has regulated the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  I have no function in the matter.</p><p>  For Bord G&aacute;is Energy&rsquo;s residential tariffs, the allowed revenue is examined twice yearly.  These examinations set the BG Energy tariffs for the following six months of the gas year.  To set the prices that BG Energy may charge customers, the CER first determines the revenue that BG Energy needs to earn to meet costs efficiently.  These costs include the cost of buying wholesale gas, transportation, BG Energy's own supply cost, profit margin and capital expenditure.  The most recent Gas Tariff Review (CER/12/146) was published on 4 September 2012.</p><p>  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers. Ireland is however a price taker for gas.</p><p>  The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy is charged to all electricity customers.  It is designed to support the national policy objectives of security of energy supply, the use of indigenous fuels (i.e. peat) and the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation, as set out in legislation. The proceeds of the levy are used to recoup, inter alia, the additional costs incurred by electricity suppliers in sourcing, and ESB Power Generation producing, a proportion of their electricity from such generators.</p><p>  Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 sets out the legal basis for the PSO levy in Ireland.  Statutory Instrument No. 217 of 2002 made under Section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act requires that the CER calculates and certifies the costs associated with the PSO and sets the associated levy for the required period.  The PSO levy takes into account the estimated and actual costs incurred in undertaking generation activities which are covered in the relevant PSO legislation. Articles 8 and 9 of Statutory Instrument 217 of 2002 set out the methodology of the calculation of the components of the PSO levy and the estimation of the amount of the PSO levy by the CER.</p></reply>

Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time. </p><p>  Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &ndash; 2013 was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme. No proposal for the Castleisland Sewerage Scheme was received from Kerry County Council in response to the review process.</p></reply>

Circular HMS 05/2003, as updated by Circular HMS 06 and 06A/2003, outlined the operation of the Scheme, including details in respect of repayment calculation on the mortgage and rental elements of such loans. </p><p>Under the scheme the rent charged on the local authority&rsquo;s equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates. Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority&rsquo;s share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.Local authority mortgage holders &ndash; including those who purchased under shared ownership &ndash; also benefit from extremely keenly priced interest rates which currently stand at around 1.5% below average variable rates available in the market. This is a very substantial differential.</p><p>  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the shared ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude later in the year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, will be informed by that review.</p></reply>

One of the conditions of the Plan, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.</p><p>  The provision requiring that mortgage protection insurance is held by mortgage holders is contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995. This legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>  Compared with other schemes of mortgage protection, the local authority scheme covers disability as well as death, and the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available.</p><p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee seeks to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided. In negotiating a renewal of the scheme, which came into effect from 1 January 2012, the Committee was able to harness the downward pressure on pricing in the economy and secure an average 19% reduction on the rate which applied to the previous scheme.</p></reply>

My Department has been working with the main health insurers and has agreed in principle a system of improved cash-flow and accelerated payments, which will provide a once-off cash flow benefit in 2012 in the region of &euro;125m for the health system.  The detailed arrangements for the accelerated payments are being finalised with the health insurers at present.</p><p>  The HSE is continuing a drive to reduce the time taken to submit claims to private health insurance companies. A key element in this drive includes the implementation of an electronic claims management system in its hospitals. This system will address the deficiencies of the paper based process and will also ensure that standardised work practices are implemented across hospitals.</p></reply>

The level of funding available for the health budget and the extent of the savings required in the health sector is being considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2013 which is currently underway. Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-18a.1091.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101800067#WRW02100"><p>I share the Deputy's concern about sulky racing on public roads and the dangers created by it. Animal-drawn vehicles are bound by road traffic legislation, as are all vehicles used on public roads.  If used properly and in accordance with the legislation they should not pose a danger to other road users.  I do not believe that it would be proportionate to ban any particular category of vehicle from the roads  because some very reckless individuals have used them in ways which are illegal.     </p><p>  It is of course a matter of concern when vehicles are used improperly.  In particular, there can be no question of using public roads for races with sulkies or any other kind of vehicle, except in circumstances where sections of public road are temporarily closed to regular traffic by the relevant authorities for the purposes of legitimate sporting events.  I am however satisfied that the Garda have sufficient power under current legislation to intervene in cases where people using sulkies, or any other kind of vehicle, are acting illegally, whether by racing or in any other way.</p></reply>

The price cap set by CAR for this year is &euro;10.76 but the DAA has, however, kept the headline charge at the 2011 rate of &euro;10.43 which is 3.2 % below the cap for 2012. </p><p>  A published study of airport charges conducted in 2010 by the Airports Council International (ACI) found that Dublin Airport's charges were in the middle range of comparable metropolitan airports in Europe.  A cost comparative exercise would be beneficial but difficult, as the data needed is commercially sensitive and not readily available.</p><p>  The Jobs Initiative launched by the Government last year includes a three-pronged strategy to encourage inbound tourism.  One element of this is the introduction of a new growth incentive scheme by the DAA at the three State airports.</p><p>  This scheme which is due to run until 2014 was designed to encourage growth in passenger numbers.  Earlier this year, DAA paid a rebate of &euro;1.5 million to the 30 airlines that grew their business from Dublin last year.  </p></reply>
