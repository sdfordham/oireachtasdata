These measures were introduced as they were considered to protect young people from welfare dependency by providing young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  Should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment participate on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment rose rapidly in the recession to over 30% in 2012.  According to the CSOs monthly unemployment report, youth unemployment fell to 15.9% last month. </p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs, through earlier and enhanced engagement processes.</p>  <p>  Reserved places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes have also been rolled out.  Overall, young people took up just over 19,000 Youth Guarantee-related programme places in 2015.  These numbers exclude an estimated 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  Other EU and OECD countries adopt a similar targeted approach in terms of young jobseekers receiving a reduced social welfare payment.  The aim is to encourage and support our young people to engage in education and training in order to reduce the risk that they may drift into welfare dependency.  For obvious reasons this needs to be avoided as welfare dependency will have severe long term consequences for those affected and for the economy as a whole. </p></reply>

The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a scheme that allows persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments the opportunity to pursue a course of study, while still maintaining their income support.  Entitlement to the BTEA is conditional on having an on-going entitlement to the qualifying scheme payment.  Changes have been introduced gradually to the BTEA following a review carried out on employment supports schemes in 2012.  These changes have only been introduced for new applicants.</p>  <p>  From the 2016/2017 academic year, BTEA participants with eligibility based on jobseekers, transitional jobseekers or one parent family payments who engage in part-time work will be assessed in accordance with their primary payment.  This measure ensures that only participants who continue to satisfy the means test of their primary payment - or another qualifying BTEA payment - will continue to receive income support under the BTEA and that resources are directed at those most in need of assistance.  In effect, this allows jobseekers to participate in a course of education while unemployed and continue to receive an income support equivalent to their jobseeker payment.  </p>  <p>  The processing of BTEA claims and related queries for people on jobseekers, transitional jobseekers or one parent family payments are dealt with by the relevant INTREO offices.  Intreo is the single point of contact in my Department for all employment programmes and income supports and it is designed to provide a more streamlined and efficient approach for jobseekers engaging with the Department. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering - or re-entering - the third level education system.  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  The purpose of the BTEA is to raise educational and skill levels in order to improve a welfare recipient&rsquo;s employment prospects and the priority for my Department is to ensure that the allowance is focused and targeted at those most in need.</p></reply>

The rent supplement scheme is supporting some 50,700 tenants at a cost of &euro;267 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  The rent limits under this scheme were increased effective from 1 July 2016.  The review process undertaken represented a realignment of the maximum rent limits with agreed rents, with rents generally benchmarked against the 35th percentile of those registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.  The review&rsquo;s methodology was conducted in the same manner for all counties, is evidenced based and reflects the pressures on rental properties in each location. </p>  <p>  A weighted average increase of some 30% has been applied across both the rent limits previously in place in the Fingal and Non-Fingal areas of Dublin.  The review showed that there remained a price differential between Fingal and Non-Fingal Dublin areas though both experienced a uniform increase in overall rental pricing. </p>  <p>  In county Kerry and in line with earlier rent reviews, the limits are benchmarked against the major urban centre of Tralee.  Rental prices in areas of significant tourist activity in county Kerry are both high in pricing and long term let properties are also in very short supply.  Rents in county Offaly were benchmarked against those in the Tullamore and Edenderry areas. </p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is being rolled out and is operational in county Offaly.  This support will be available in Kerry by year end and in the Fingal area during 2017. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the ongoing difficulties in the rental market, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the maximum limits.  This ensures that people at risk of homelessness through the loss of their tenancy continue to be supported under the rent supplement scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-06a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100600039#WRA01700"><p>The State pension contributory is one of a number of pensions the State pays to people over 66.  The rate of payment to a person is related to the number of contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund by the person.  Entitlement levels are calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification easier for those who took time out of the workforce for caring duties.  It allows up to 20 such years, in the period since its introduction, to be disregarded when their record is being averaged for pension purposes.  </p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.</p>  <p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach will replace the yearly average approach from around 2020, and the position of homemakers will be carefully considered in the context of that reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  The average waiting time for new carer's allowance (CA) applications at the end of August was 17 weeks.  At the end of August, there were 4,834 CA applications awaiting decision.  The volume of CA claims on hands are a consequence of continued strong claim intake and the delays in processing are frequently caused by the customer failing to fully complete the claim form or failing to attach the supporting documentation that is requested on the application form.</p>  <p>  My Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for CA and hope to have numbers on hand down to around 4k at the end of September.  </p>  <p>  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In cases where the family unit has broken down these obligations continue to apply and relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either directly between the couple or through supports like the Family Mediation Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts.  The arrangement of maintenance is therefore a matter between both parents regardless of whether or not either parent is in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  The liability to maintain family provisions, contained in social welfare legislation, are separate to, and do not negate or supersede parents&rsquo; obligations under Family Law.  Where a lone parent is in receipt of the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP), the liability to maintain family provisions provide my Department with a legislative basis to carry out an assessment against the other parent and issue a Determination Order for them to pay a contribution either to the Department or the lone parent.</p>  <p>  Where the OFP payment ceases, and the Department had successfully arranged a contribution from the other parent (which only occurs in less than 8% of cases), the Department must inform the other parent that his/her liability to the Department has ceased.  The letter does not inform the other parent that s/he is no longer liable to pay maintenance and makes it clear that any existing maintenance arrangements private or otherwise should remain in place.  These letters have always issued when the OFP payment ceases.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently reviewing the liability to maintain family provisions.</p></reply>

The conditions include progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications.  The student universal support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  The BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.</p><p>Applicants holding a qualification at tertiary education level (certificate, diploma, primary degree or post graduate qualification) are not approved under the BTEA to pursue a course at a similar or lower qualification level.  However, the BTEA may be approved if a person holds a HETAC level 8 Honours degree and wishes to pursue a Higher Diploma at HETAC Level 8 as this is considered progression.</p><p>There are a small number of situations where the progression rule is not applied.  For instance, where a person only holds a FETAC Level 5 or FETAC Level 6, the progression rule can be waived if their previous qualification was obtained three years prior to re-entry into education and provided the person was in employment for a period of at least three years since commencement of employment.

The service is known as JobPath.  JobPath was designed having regard to international experience of contracted employment services.  Participants spend 12 months on JobPath and receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are provided with a range of training and development supports.  If the jobseeker secures employment they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.</p>  <p>  Seetec has 32 years&rsquo; experience in the UK of delivering employability, skills, training and rehabilitation programmes that are designed to support people into sustained employment, education and training or to support rehabilitation.  It supports 100,000 clients per annum to address and overcome issues such as unemployment, skills shortages, health conditions, social exclusion and re-offending. </p>  <p>  While Seetec provides a similar service for jobseekers in the UK it is important to point out that there are significant differences between the two services.  Unlike the UK service, JobPath contracts stipulate a significant number of requirements, including an in-built &ldquo;Service Guarantee&rdquo; which means that each jobseeker will be guaranteed a baseline level of service including frequency on meetings with case officers, treatment with courtesy and respect and  a transparent complaints process.  As part of the contract terms Seetec  is subject to penalty payments if it fails to achieve satisfactory scores in independent research on customer satisfaction with its services.  Payments are also contingent on Seetec satisfying Department inspectors that it is complying with the terms of its contract and most significantly payments are based in the first instance on Seetec securing sustained employment for its clients with these payments being phased over a 12 month period of employment.  Seetec is strongly incentivised therefore to offer a high level of service to its clients.   </p>  <p>  While the contract is in its early stages of implementation feedback to date is very positive and initial indications, in terms of employment outcomes, are also very encouraging.  I am therefore satisfied, at this point in time, that the JobPath service is being delivered in a manner that meets the needs of jobseekers.</p></reply>

Over 5,000 job vacancies are currently advertised on the site.</p><p>Jobs Ireland was first developed 20 years ago and was showing its age in comparison to job sites operated by other public employment services in recent years.  For example, although it enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type and location, it wasn&rsquo;t possible for employers to search for suitable jobseekers on the site &ndash; they had to rely on candidates finding and applying for a job from among the many thousands hosted on the system.</p><p>Accordingly, the Department issued a tender last year for the development and implementation of a new Jobs Ireland service that would enable both employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skillsets as well as the traditional job-type classifications.  As part of the new service, candidate profiles will be automatically matched to job specifications posted by employers with both candidate and the employer notified via email and/or SMS when a suitable match is found.  Candidates can also use the site to apply for the jobs advertised.  The system will also integrate with the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo service and will include other new features such as allowing jobseekers to post CVs and video profiles if they wish.</p><p>Following the procurement process, the contract was awarded to a firm that is now building and delivering the new service from a base in Cork.  The service is being implemented on a phased basis which means, unfortunately, that there is some service disruption while work is ongoing.  In addition the first phase implementation has not performed to specification.  The Department is working with the supplier to address the service issues and add new functionality over the coming weeks.</p><p>Employers or any person experiencing difficulties with the website can contact the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre on 1890 800 024 for assistance.

FIS is designed to tackle child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  There are over 55,000 families with almost 123,000 children in receipt of FIS.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;410 million, an increase of around &euro;60 million on last year.</p>  <p>  An integral part of FIS is that the payment continues at the same rate for a period of 52 weeks, assuming the eligibility requirements continue to be met, except in the following circumstances:</p>  <p>  - If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks.</p>  <p>  - If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in earnings.  This aspect of the FIS scheme is important in speeding up processing times for claims, which could otherwise be subject to delays due to periodic reviews.  It also ensures that people who transition from welfare into employment have quick access to an in work benefit, which could be an important factor in their decision to take up employment.</p>  <p>  However, the key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides an incentive to claimants to maximise their earnings from employment (e.g. more hours, higher wages).  In view of the above, I have no plans to change the legislation.</p></reply>

In September 2014 the IRC issued a DSPRIA call for proposals under the theme &ldquo;An Active Inclusion Approach to Lone Parents&rdquo;.  The successful applicant, selected by the IRC in November 2014, was Dr. Michelle Millar of NUI Galway for her proposed study &ldquo;Lone Parents and Activation, What Works and Why: A Review of the International Evidence in the Irish Context&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The manner and timing of publication of a study report in these circumstances are matters for the researchers.

The report does not purport to be an analysis of the lone parent reforms.  The qualitative interviews in the report will add to our knowledge but the sample size is small and the period of implementation of the reforms is very short.  It is too soon to draw definitive conclusions about the outcome of these reforms.</p>  <p>  The report references CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data on child poverty figures for 2013, which state that 11.7% of children were in consistent poverty.  However, the most recent SILC data for 2014 shows that there has been a slight decrease in this figure to 11.2%.  Furthermore the consistent poverty rate of lone parents has decreased from 23% in 2013 to 22.1% in 2014.</p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not yet reflected in these figures.  Ireland has returned to strong economic and employment growth.  The unemployment rate in April 2016 was 8.4%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2015 and 2016 become available.</p></reply>

It stated that &ldquo;In order to maintain this aim of preventing poverty for older people, the Government will seek to sustain the value of the State Pension at 35% of average weekly earnings and will support this through the PRSI contribution system.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The aspirational tone of this commitment recognised that a great many factors can intervene in such a target, notably the rise (and in some recent years fall) of workers' earnings, which also in turn impacts upon workers&rsquo; capacity to pay extra PRSI.  The text also indicates that any increases in payments required to reach this target would come through the Social Insurance Fund, rather than through Exchequer subvention.</p>  <p>  The most recent CSO release on Average Earnings was on 25 August 2016, which stated that average weekly earnings in Q2 of 2016 were &euro;703.83, making the State pension (personal) rate 33.15% of that figure, or 1.85% below the target of 35%.  This does not include allowances such as the Living Alone Allowance, the over 80s Allowance, Fuel Allowance, or the Household Benefits package.</p>  <p>  There are three measures used by the CSO Survey of Income and Living Conditions which measure poverty among older people and the general population.  The most recent survey, which relates to 2014, was released in November 2015.  This showed that the percentage of those over 65 at risk of poverty is currently 10.3%, compared to 16.3% of the total population.

The use of a means test is to ensure that resources are directed to those in greatest need.</p>  <p>  Payments from the United Kingdom (UK) are assessed as income under current legislation.  If the person applying for a Social Assistance payment has a UK pension, it is assessable, together with all other means such as savings and investments, when determining the rate of payment.  In assessing means derived from payments received from non-European Monetary Union (EMU) States, the Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers.  Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter.  This rate is then used in all conversions during the course of the succeeding quarter.  The exchange rates for converting sterling and other non EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union, and take account of currency fluctuations.  The Department obtains this rate at the beginning of each quarter.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of the UK referendum, negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU will take time.  In the interim, it is important to stress that all payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including those to recipients who are resident in Britain and Northern Ireland, and payments from the UK to residents in Ireland, will continue to be paid.</p>  <p>  My Department is keeping the currency situation under review.  It is open to any person in receipt of a social assistance payment to request that his/her entitlement be reviewed if they wish.  It is important to note, however, that any such review will involve a full reassessment of all of the customer&rsquo;s means to ensure that the person continues to receive the correct payment in line with their overall entitlement.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is too soon to draw definitive conclusions about the outcome of these reforms.</p>  <p>  However, the overall direction remains the activation of lone parents, and I believe that this report supports this principle also.  Data shows that being at work reduces consistent poverty among lone parent families; those at work have consistent poverty rates of 9.6% compared to 35.5% for those not at work.  Therefore the key to ensuring lone parents are lifted out of poverty is to aim to support lone parents into employment.</p>  <p>  The report highlights the critical nature of the Case Officer role within my Department and the importance of a package of supports including pre-employment, employment, financial and childcare.</p>  <p>  It is too early to determine the full impact of the reforms.

This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally.

In 2014, lone parents were two-and-a-half times more at risk of poverty than the rest of the population.  However, in 2004, during the economic boom, lone parents were over four-and-a-half times more at risk of poverty than the rest of the population.  These figures are of course not acceptable but they show the long standing problem we have of lone parents being in poverty.</p><p>Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, compared to those who do not work, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.</p><p>Access to my Department&rsquo;s Intreo service is critical to achieve this outcome.  Any reversal of these reforms would delay access to this essential service and would be a retrograde step in terms of tackling poverty among lone parents.</p><p>The positive outcome of the reforms can be seen from the increase in the number of lone parents becoming new family income supplement recipients.  Of the lone parents affected by the reforms since July 2015, more than 3,000 became new family income supplement recipients by the end of 2015.  This indicates that these customers entered or increased their employment.  These customers are also eligible for the Back to Work Family Dividend.  There are currently over 7,100<b></b>lone parents in receipt of the Back to Work Family Dividend.</p><p>It is also important to highlight that the social impact assessment of Budget 2016 showed that the measures contained in the Budget increased average household incomes by 1.6%.  This analysis showed that incomes for non-working lone parents increased above average, gaining 1.8% and working lone parents gained the most with their average incomes gaining by 2%.</p><p>As such, I have no plans to reverse the change in conditions the Deputy refers to.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service, others would have worked abroad and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g. caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances.  In some cases, a person might never have been in insurable employment.  If such people do not claim a State pension, their details will not form part of the statistics generated by management of those schemes.</p>  <p>  Therefore there are no statistics available to my Department detailing the number of people who spent period(s) outside the Irish labour market, and who, as a direct result of those periods, would not qualify for a State pension.  Such statistics would comprise largely of people who have not paid PRSI for many decades, and who in many cases would not have made a claim under the State pension system.</p>  <p>  Public service pensions are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The staff member will also consider if a bereavement grant is available from any other source including former employer, credit union, trade union etc.  </p>  <p>  Assistance with funeral costs is a long-standing feature of the ENP scheme, rather than a replacement for the discontinued PRSI-based bereavement grant, and is part of a range of supports available from my Department for people following bereavement.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Participation is entirely voluntary; there is no obligation on jobseekers to look for, or take up a JobBridge internship and jobseeker payments are not conditional on participation in JobBridge.</p><p>An independent evaluation of the scheme published in 2013 found that over 60% of participants progressed into paid employment within a short period of completing their internship.  This suggests that JobBridge has been instrumental in helping about 30,000 jobseekers to secure employment.  </p><p>The scheme was introduced in response to the unprecedented collapse in the economy, particularly the sharp increase in unemployment.  I have already announced that I plan to replace JobBridge in response to criticisms of the scheme and the much improved economic and labour market conditions.</p><p>It is important that the design of any new scheme be informed by the best available evidence.  That is why I intend to wait for the results of the second large-scale evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon and London Economics before finalising the design of any replacement scheme.  </p><p>I also asked the Labour Market Council for its views.

To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and may not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. </p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service for a significant period, others would have worked abroad during their working life and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g., caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to abolish either the State pension (contributory), or the State pension (non-contributory), as both are very effective in ensuring that older people have a decent standard of living.  In addition, workers who pay PRSI over their working lives receive a benefit which allows them make further provision for their retirement without losing that benefit via a means test.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;. Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  The position of gender and gaps in contribution records will be considered very carefully in developing these proposals.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They are informed that they have been selected for the programme and their contact details are sent to the relevant Implementing Body.  To further support the recruitment process, the Department has put arrangements in place for jobseekers meeting the criteria to apply to the Department for participation on T&uacute;s.  In such cases, Departmental case officers nominate suitable candidates for recruitment.</p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for T&uacute;s are in line with the Government&rsquo;s policies to focus resources on maintaining the work readiness and employability of jobseekers on the Live Register.  In order to maintain this focus, persons who are not in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment are not eligible for selection for the T&uacute;s programme.</p>  <p>  The current eligibility criteria for the CE programme have been expanded over the years.  The basic eligibility requirement is that a person must be currently in receipt of a CE-qualifying payment from my Department for the requisite period of time, for example jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, for a minimum period of twelve months.  Recent changes to the eligibility criteria for CE include the reduction in the entry age for CE participants working directly with service users in the childcare sector and social/healthcare sector to 21 years of age.  The standard minimum entry age for CE is 25 years of age.  The eligibility criteria for participants aged 62 and over have also been eased in terms of the maximum duration they can remain on the programme, subject to certain conditions.</p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for both the CE and T&uacute;s programmes are kept under review to ensure that they remains fit for purpose and that there is the maximum utilisation of places.</p>  <p>  If there is a specific issue with regard to the processing time of an application for a work scheme, the matter should be raised with the local Intreo/DSP Office.  Intreo is the single point of contact in my Department for all employment programmes and income supports and it is designed to provide a more streamlined and efficient approach for jobseekers engaging with the Department. </p>  <p>  As you might be aware a review of CE schemes was conducted by the Department.

Should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment participate on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment rose rapidly in the recession to over 30% in 2012.  According to the Quarterly National Household Survey for Quarter 2 2016, youth unemployment fell by 3.4% to 19% as compared to Quarter 2 2015. </p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs, through earlier and enhanced engagement processes.</p>  <p>  Reserved places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes have also been rolled out.  Overall, young people took up just over 19,000 Youth Guarantee-related programme places in 2015.  These numbers exclude an estimated 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  Other EU and OECD countries adopt a similar targeted approach in terms of young jobseekers receiving a reduced social welfare payment.  The aim is to encourage and support our young people to engage in education and training in order to reduce the risk that they may drift into welfare dependency.  For obvious reasons this needs to be avoided as welfare dependency will have severe long term consequences for those affected and for the economy as a whole.</p></reply>

Staff are deployed across a wide range of activities including the broad areas of asylum and immigration processing, visa processing, border management and policy areas of the organisation.  In that context, the management of resources is kept under constant review having regard to business and operational requirements, and staff are deployed accordingly.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that, given the nature of the work involved and the need to allow for flexibility in the assignment and prioritisation of tasks at peak times for the service, it has not been possible to isolate the number of staff assigned solely to processing activities, or specifically to the processing of individual application types such as residence cards under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015.  The information  requested by the Deputy in relation to the staff by grade in each office is set out in the table.  It should be noted that the numbers specified in the tables for Clerical Officers (CO) includes staff recruited as Temporary Clerical Officers.  These staff are employed on a fixed term contract basis to cover temporary vacancies and short term staffing needs.<table><tr><th>Grade</th><th>INIS </th><th>Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner </th><th>Refugee Appeals Tribunal</th><th>Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency</th></tr><tr><td>A/Sec</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>PO</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>AP</td><td>20</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>HEO</td><td>51</td><td>26</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>AO</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>EO</td><td>126</td><td>29</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>SO</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CO</td><td>283</td><td>39</td><td>23</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>SVO</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>509</td><td>116</td><td>38</td><td>24</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This also sought the Government's observations including by reference to the ongoing development of the Legal Services Regulation Bill of 2011.  The 2013 Notice of a potential breach is a public document and has, therefore, been a matter of public record.  It should also be noted in this regard that a breach as notified has not yet been determined and it remains, therefore, a &ldquo;potential breach&rdquo;.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Early inquiries raised by the European Commission in 2012 were made by reference to section 123 of the 2011 Bill dealing with the advertising issue and its possible further refinement to ensure compliance with the Services Directive.  From then on the matter was negotiated on the basis of the new provisions being developed by the Government under the Bill and with a view to providing the level of &quot;certainty&quot; of compliance desired by the Commission in the new legislation.  This arose naturally from the fact that the Legal Services Regulation Bill of 2011, including its advertising reforms, came to attention as a specific deliverable under the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Programme of that time.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I am happy to say that the legislative solution, negotiated with the European Commission, is that now found under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  Under this provision the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority will assume responsibility for the regulation of advertising by both solicitors and barristers - thereby replacing the professional bodies in that function which they had exercised historically.  Hence, the potential infringement has been for resolution by negotiation, at the legislative level.  This has been on the basis of there being a new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority that would regulate lawyers&rsquo; advertising instead of the legal professional bodies.  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">While the Notice of a potential infringement has not technically been lifted, it remains the intention of the Government to continue to address the Commission's concerns through the independent regulation of lawyers' advertising by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority under section 218 of the 2015 Act which will soon be commenced.  Exchanges and clarifications with the Commission are ongoing on that basis.  The Deputy will also wish to note that section 218  also contains a consultation provision whereby the new Regulatory Authority will, before making new advertising regulations, consult with the professional bodies and with the other interested parties concerned.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">As the Government is, and remains, the notice party to these ongoing infringement proceedings and the negotiated solution with the European Commission is being achieved under new legislation, there has been limited direct contact on the matter with the professional bodies.  In the case of the Law Society this has been by way of obtaining clarifications on aspects of the application of their existing advertising regulations at the request of the Commission.  In the case of the Bar Council my Department has consulted the relevant provisions of the Council's Code of Conduct and of its Advertising Guidelines for members. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I hope that the Deputy will find the information I have been able to provide in this instance, while also taking into account the fact that the relevant infringement proceedings to which the Government is party are ongoing, to be of assistance in clarifying the current situation.</font></p></reply>

There is also potential for EFSI to support a number of other Irish projects in areas such as broadband; renewable energy/energy efficiency; transport and water infrastructure; social infrastructure; and support for SMEs/commercial enterprises.  President Juncker launched a Commission proposal to extend EFSI both in terms of time and financial capacity on 14 September last and Ireland is fully engaged in the discussions towards securing an agreement that will continue to support investment across the EU including in Ireland.</p>  <p>  However Ireland still must comply with the two pillars of the fiscal rules, namely the Expenditure Benchmark and the pace of correction in the level of the structural balance.  These rules constrain public spending to levels consistent with the financing capacity of the economy, ensure that spending is sustainably financed and help return the economy towards a balanced budget in structural terms.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-06a.199.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100600045#WRG01000"><p>I am informed by Revenue that an individual in a defined contribution pension savings arrangement has the option of putting the funds accumulated under the arrangement into an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) on retirement, subject to conditions. </p>  <p>  Where such an individual is under the age of 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the requirement of having a minimum guaranteed pension income for life of &euro;12,700 per annum, he or she is required to set aside an amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension fund if less than &euro;63,500 after taking a retirement lump sum) by investing the amount in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) or by the purchase of an annuity.  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual, without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life, has a capital nest-egg to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement.</p>  <p>  The changes to the AMRF arrangements which I introduced in Finance Act 2014, with effect from 1 January 2015, allow an AMRF owner draw down up to 4% of the value of the fund assets on one occasion annually until he or she either meets the guaranteed pension income requirement or attains the age of 75, at which point, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds can be drawn down at the owner's discretion.  In general, drawdowns from AMRFs (and ARFs) are subject to income tax, PRSI (up to age 66) and USC.</p>  <p>  The 4% annual draw down arrangement, replaced the facility that existed previously, whereby an AMRF owner could draw down the accrued income and gains of the AMRF (subject to tax etc.) as and when they wished.  This change was prompted by a concern to allow all AMRF owners, particularly those with relatively modest retirement funds, access to a more certain level of annual drawdown from their AMRF, rather than the uncertain level of drawdown that dependence on investment performance had given rise to heretofore.  This is particularly important for those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds.</p>  <p>  As indicated earlier, the primary purpose of the minimum guaranteed pension income condition applying to the ARF option is to ensure that where this condition is not met, that there is a capital nest egg available to the individual in older age.  This condition has been in place since the inception of ARFs in 1999.  At that time, it was set at &pound;10,000 which, on the introduction of the Euro in 2002, converted to its Euro equivalent of &euro;12,700.  This was significantly higher than the maximum rate of the contributory State pension payable in 1999 (i.e. &pound;4,628 or &euro;5,876).  It is clear, therefore, that there was no intended link between the State pension and the minimum guaranteed income limit, and in addition that it was never envisaged that the State pension on its own would be sufficient to satisfy the guaranteed pension income test.  Thus, it was always envisaged that an individual would need an additional source of pension income to meet the requirement.</p>  <p>  I should add, that when I extended the ARF option to all defined contribution arrangements in Finance Act 2011, the conditions to be satisfied to allow an individual access to an ARF were also amended.  In the case of the guaranteed pension income requirement, this was significantly increased to &euro;18,000 (i.e. one and a half times the annual rate of the contributory State pension at the time) and it was my intention that it would track the annual rate of the contributory  pension over time.  However, I rescinded this change in Finance Act 2013 and the guaranteed pension income requirement has remained at &euro;12,700 since. </p>  <p>  In light of the fact that the contributory State pension has more than doubled since 1999 while the minimum guaranteed pension test for ARF purposes remains at &euro;12,700, the gap between the two has narrowed appreciably.  If the two were to be aligned, it would have to apply across the board and not just for the type of special case related to health mentioned in the question.</p>  <p>  In that regard, however, I have no plans at this time to make such a change.</p></reply>

However, I can inform the Deputy that only 6 liable persons own more than 1,000 properties and Revenue have confirmed that all 6 are approved housing bodies (also sometimes known as voluntary housing associations).</p><p>As regards the Deputy's query on confidentiality, the provisions of Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 oblige Revenue to treat taxpayer information confidentially.  Confidentiality is central to Revenue's relationship with its customers but, in recognition of the value of providing a broad range of statistical insights into tax administration, Revenue attempts to balance the requirements of confidentiality while providing as much useful information as possible.</p><p>There exists considerable best practice regarding the disclosure of statistical information and confidentiality.  A Statistical Disclosure Control document is published on the Revenue website at <i>.</i>This document outlines Revenue's approach to ensuring the balance (between the need to inform and the safeguarding of taxpayer confidentiality) is achieved in the production of Revenue Statistics.  It may be of interest to the Deputy to note also that the Central Statistics Office operates a similar approach to statistical confidentiality.</p><p>Over the last year, Revenue has redesigned its statistics webpage <i>(</i><i><i>l</i></i>) to provide improved coverage and depth of the statistical information published, and this information is now also published in more open or machine readable formats where possible to further aid researchers and other users.  This places Revenue at the forefront of the Government's Open Data initiative to provide information in as open and transparent a manner as possible.</p></reply>

This would prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions with a likely loss of employment and tax revenue.  Notwithstanding this, the previous Government was not prepared to stand in the way of EU Member States that wished to work together to implement a Financial Transactions Tax and in this regard adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced cooperation took place during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in January 2013. </p><p>The UK intention to commence the process of leaving the European Union increases the difficulties of introducing such a tax given the potential for the UK to compete more strongly using different domestic measures for such financial services activities outside the EU.</p><p>In any event despite significant engagement by the relevant Member States there has been no agreement on the introduction of an FTT and it is not clear whether agreement will be achieved in the near future. </p><p>Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions, a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%.  The yield from this charge in 2015 was &euro;424.13 million and I understand receipts to end September 2016 were over &euro;287 million and is expected to raise up to &euro;498m in 2016.  If Ireland was to participate in the FTT it would require us to abolish this Stamp Duty.</p><p>In relation to the question raised by the Deputy on the potential economic and employment impact of an FTT in Ireland I would refer to the joint Central Bank of Ireland/ESRI report published in April 2012 which considered the possible economic impact of the application of FTT <i>()</i>.  The report analyses the potential economic impact on the financial industry at that stage based on the Commission's 2011 FTT proposal.</p><p>While I appreciate that the study may be somewhat dated at this point the report's conclusions are a useful indicator of the possible impact of introducing an FTT in Ireland.  Given that it is Government policy not to introduce an FTT, I do not consider it prudent to allocate resources to further studies or exercises in this regard at this time. </p><p>The joint Central Bank/ESRI report recognises that assessing the likely impact on employment and tax yields due to migration of activity is difficult.  This continues to be the case as it is difficult to assess behaviour arising from the introduction of such a tax and second round impacts on investment and employment. </p><p>In 2012 the financial sector's share of overall economic output in Ireland was around twice as large as that of many other European countries and in 2016 it remains a significant element within the economy in terms of employment and gross value added.  There is significant employment in the sector with around 35,000 individuals employed in international financial services.</p><p>The report sought to identify financial services sectors which could be impacted by an FTT.  It suggested that insurance, banking and financial intermediation, and fund management and security broking were potentially vulnerable to an FTT.  Fund management in particular has been one of the growth areas of the financial services sector in Ireland with some large employers and with a total estimated 13,000 employed in the sector.  </p><p>The report concludes that the firms with the highest propensity to migrate following the introduction of an FTT are likely to be in the non-banking sectors which account for the smallest share of gross value added.  Nevertheless, it indicates that the relocation of even a small number of large IFSC banks or fund administration firms would result in a loss of income tax revenue, corporation tax revenue, and an increase in unemployment.  This would likely still be the impact now of introducing a FTT. </p><p>I remain of the view that there are potentially significant negative employment and economic impacts from introducing an FTT in Ireland and I have no plans to introduce such a tax.</p></reply>

A home reversion agreement is one where an owner sells his/her home to a Home Reversion Firm (in return for a discounted sum or an income or both) subject to the right to continue to live in the residence until the person permanently moves out or dies.  In substance, this type of agreement involves an up-front property transaction.  Lifetime loans (sometimes called lifetime mortgages or reverse mortgages) on the other hand are credit agreements where a loan is provided and secured on the borrower's home, interest payments on the loan are rolled up on top of the principal amount throughout the term of the loan, the borrower retains ownership of the property and the right to continue to reside in the property and the loan is eventually repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the property after the borrower permanently moves out of the property or dies.  Both of these are niche products, usually provided to people aged 60 or older.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that, from February 2008, the Central Bank of Ireland is the body responsible for the authorisation and supervision of Home Reversion Firms.  However, specific authorisation as a Home Reversion Firm is not required where the firm is the holder of another authorisation from the Central Bank in accordance with Section 29(1) of the Central Bank Act 1997.  Firms authorised to provide mortgage credit in the State may provide lifetime mortgages.  The Central Bank has advised that details of Home Reversion Firms currently authorised in the State and firms authorised to provide credit in the State can be accessed via the Registers section of the Central Bank's website.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further advised that the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (CPC) contains a number of requirements for regulated entities regarding the provision of information to personal consumers relating to lifetime mortgages and home reversion agreements.  The CPC also requires that personal consumers are made aware of the importance of seeking independent legal advice.  In particular, prior to a lifetime mortgage being taken out the CPC requires that a personal consumer must be informed of:</p>  <p>  -  the circumstances in which the loan will have to be repaid  </p>  <p>  -  details of the interest rate that will be charged  </p>  <p>  -  an explanation of the impact of the rolling up of the interest over the duration of the loan  </p>  <p>  -  an indication of the amount required to repay the loan at maturity </p>  <p>  -  the effect on the existing mortgage, if any; and </p>  <p>  -  an indication of the likely early redemption costs which would be incurred if the loan was redeemed on the third and fifth anniversary of the loan and at five yearly intervals thereafter.</p>  <p>  Prior to a home reversion agreement being taken out, the CPC also requires that a personal consumer must be informed of: </p>  <p>  -  the circumstances in which the agreement comes to an end;  </p>  <p>  -  the effect on the existing mortgage, if any; and </p>  <p>  -  in the case of a variable-share contract, an indication of the potential change in the breakdown of the ownership of the property between that held by the home reversion company and the personal consumer, over the duration of the agreement</p>  <p>  Also, certain warning statements must be provided on advertisements, application forms, the regulated entities website and other documents related to lifetime mortgages or home reversion agreements.  For lifetime mortgages, the personal consumer must be warned that while no interest is payable during the period of the mortgage, the interest is compounded on an annual basis and is payable in full in circumstances such as death, permanent vacation of or sale of the property.  For home reversion agreements, personal consumers must be warned that the money they receive may be much less than the actual market value of the share in their home.

The VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC) sets the framework for the VAT rates in the EU, and provides that Member States must apply a standard rate, which in Ireland is currently 23%.  The Directive also allows Member States to apply a maximum of two reduced VAT rates in limited circumstances and, in line with the Directive, Ireland currently applies to reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%.  However, there is no provision in the Directive to allow for a rate of VAT to be applied in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.</p></reply>

For a reduction in VAT could, theoretically, lead to an increase in sales of particular goods or services.  These considerations must be balanced against the potential negative impacts of changing the application of or the rates of tax and the need to fund the activities of the State. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market.  In terms of increasing housing supply, the Government's recently announced Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing outlines its commitment to develop a fully functioning housing market that meets the needs of its citizens.  This Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market by including actions to streamline the planning system, remove infrastructure blockages and support the delivery of affordable housing.  These measures should help make new developments economically viable in areas where supply constraints (and price pressures) are particularly acute.</p>  <p>  I am not certain therefore that any change in the rate of capital gains tax on residential lands would improve the ability to provide for a fully functioning housing market.</p></reply>

The CGT yield the figures for these years are as follows:</p><p>1996: &pound;83 million (&euro;105 million)</p><p>1997: &pound;132 million (&euro;167 million)</p><p>1998: &pound;193 million (&euro;245 million)</p><p>1999: &pound;356 million (&euro;452 million)</p><p>The point is often made that when the CGT rate was reduced from 40% to 20% in 1998, yield increased.  In fact, the yield from CGT had been increasing significantly in relative terms for some years prior to the 1998 rate change, albeit from a low base. </p><p>Several other points should also be noted in this regard.  The significant rate reduction happened at a time when asset values had been rising over a period and so large gains were available to be realised.  The rate drop may also have been anticipated by owners of assets such that they held off on disposal until it came into effect.  More generally, while a drop in CGT rates may stimulate activity in the short term, much of the effect will come from bringing forward disposals that would have occurred anyway but at a later date.  To this extent, tax yield and economic activity are not increased overall but simply moved in time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-06a.264.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100600047#WRJ01900"><p>I am taking it that the Deputy is referring to the combined numbers of Leaving Certificate Mathematics candidates at all three levels (Higher, Ordinary, and Foundation) who were awarded E grades, F grades or no grade in the 2016 examination.  The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a &ldquo;fail&rdquo; ceased in 1968.  </p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected.  Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level.  In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher-achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower-achieving end of the Higher level distribution.  This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics, colloquially known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of &ldquo;bonus points&rdquo; for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. </p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.</p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.</p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example).  In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.</p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar.  These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students. The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete.  By this time students will have been through the new maths cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers.  I have asked the State Examinations Commission to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process.  The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.</p></reply>

Institutes report on retention measures in place within their institutes to combat high non-progression rates.  The HEA funds retention initiatives in Computer Science disciplines in higher education institutions through the Information Technology Investment Fund.  In 2015 these initiatives included additional classes, attendance mentoring, teaching and learning initiatives, student support sessions, buddy practicals and maths enabling courses.  In 2016 the National Forum for Teaching and Learning established an ICT Retention Scoping Group to examine ways in which students could be enabled to complete ICT courses.  The group working with practitioners and industry are examining areas such as career guidance, pathways, provision and pedagogy. </p><p>One of the key objectives of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 (&lsquo;National Access Plan&rsquo;) is to address the issue of non-completion within higher education institutions, for those in under-represented target groups.  The Plan also commits to the further development of mechanisms to track the progression, retention and student experience of target groups.  The target student groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first time mature student entrants and students with disabilities. </p><p>To support the implementation of these objectives, a Working Group is being established to consider the issues contributing to the non-completion of target groups in the National Access Plan and to produce recommendations for policy and practice.  The group is being convened by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and will include representatives of relevant stakeholders.  Considerations of members will be informed by recent, qualitative research by the National Forum for Teaching and Learning on the reasons why students leave higher education (National Forum for Teaching and Learning, 2015).</p></reply>

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment.  SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage women to take up apprenticeships in these areas.  Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development.  The first of these new apprenticeships, the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, was launched last month with further new apprenticeships to be launched later this year and early next year.  Many of these new apprenticeships are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign.  SOLAS will examine how this campaign can assist with promoting apprenticeship to women and to their potential employers.</p></reply>

We are lucky in Ireland to have exceptionally strong school principals in disadvantaged schools &ndash; even small improvements in supports for and retention and performance of school leaders in these schools can have a dramatic impact on outcomes:</p><p>-  Networks and clusters for DEIS teachers and schools &ndash; including greater supported self-evaluation.  Stronger networks of peer groups for teachers can help develop new methods and improve outcomes </p><p>-  Teaching methodologies.  There is evidence that, for example, changing the way literacy is taught to children who struggle can achieve major improvements in results</p><p>-  Explore ways in which the work of schools could be better integrated with other state supports within the community</p><p>The results of pilot programmes will be carefully monitored before any decisions around mainstreaming are considered.</p><p>Also under consideration is the development of a new assessment framework using centrally held CSO and DES data for the identification of schools for inclusion in a new programme to tackle educational disadvantage. The number of schools to be included in the programme will be determined by this proposed new identification process which will assess all schools in the country, including those not currently participating in DEIS. </p><p>The Review process has included extensive stakeholder consultation, in particular engagement with relevant education partners. </p><p>The work undertaken by the Technical and Advisory Group is ongoing and its outcome will form part of the Action Plan, when published.  </p><p>It is envisaged that actions arising from a new Action Plan for Educational Inclusion plan will be implemented in the 2017/2018 school year.</p><p>Further details on the Review Process and the groups involved are available at <i>.</i></p></reply>

The Government's basic position is not to establish new agencies to deal with new policy challenges, as was done at times in the past, but to deal with those challenges through existing structures.</p>  <p>  Last year, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report of the study was published in November 2015.</p>  <p>  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one of the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Established earlier this year, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group is being chaired for the first year by SOLAS. Membership of the Group includes the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Group has met several times since it was established and a number of key actions are being progressed including an audit of courses and culinary facilities within both the further and higher education sectors with a view to obtaining a complete overview of existing courses and facilities, identifying gaps in provision and encouraging collaboration and sharing of facilities where possible.</p>  <p>  Since the EGFSN study has been carried out, new developments in providing for the skill needs of the sector have included:</p>  <p>  -  Approximately 220 free hospitality-related higher education places under the 2016 Springboard + programme.</p>  <p>  -  A proposal to develop a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship is at an advanced stage and is due to commence in the coming months, with training courses taking place in Education and Training Boards (ETBs) along with a work placement component.</p>  <p>  -  A proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship has been approved for development funding by the Apprenticeship Council at its last meeting in September. </p>  <p>  -  New Career Traineeships in Hospitality are being rolled out by a number of ETBs on a pilot basis with over 100 participants engaging so far. These are shorter courses, typically of up to 12 months duration.</p>  <p>  In addition, Skillnets Limited is  scoping opportunities to establish a dedicated network to serve the needs of the sector and has held a series of meetings with representatives of the industry.</p>  <p>  The skill needs of the hospitality sector will also be addressed through the new skills architecture established under the Government&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, which includes the 9 Regional Skills Fora.</p></reply>

A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness this potential, and bring these vacant houses into social housing use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists.  The new scheme will operate initially in Waterford and Carlow local authorities from today.  My Department is working closely with other local authorities to roll out the scheme around the country over the course of the next 6 months. </p>  <p>  Approved Housing Bodies' (AHBs) proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties, delivering social housing and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.  Several AHBs will be working together with Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those areas.  As the scheme is rolled out in other local authority areas, more AHBs around the country will be funded to deliver new social houses this way.   </p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant houses who cannot afford or access the money required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or AHB.  In return, the property owner will sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs but is a minimum of ten years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.   </p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have ongoing management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties. </p>  <p>  Eligibility for the scheme will be determined by the relevant local authority having regard to the location and suitability of the property for social housing and also the extent of repairs that might be required. </p>  <p>  I have secured &euro;140m for the successful implementation of this scheme over the next five years.  I am hopeful that this can bring at least 3,500 vacant houses back into productive use between now and 2021.  Early indications are that in excess of 150 new houses can be made available for social housing through the scheme in 2017.   </p></reply>

These amendments were made, in both cases, to enable more properties to qualify for the schemes and make them more flexible and accessible for borrowers.  The changes included an increase in the valuation thresholds for relevant properties and flexibility in the size of the property which qualify for the scheme.</p><p>The amendments made also included a new provision for borrowers in negative equity.  The effect is that, as a general rule, the criterion of the borrower being in negative equity remains.  However, some flexibility is provided, on a case by case basis, to allow for a borrower who is in marginal positive equity to avail of the scheme.  Under the new arrangements, under both MTR schemes, cases where the equity is no more than 10% of the Open Market Value to a maximum of &euro;20,000 in Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth, Cork and Galway and &euro;15,000 in the rest of the country can be considered under the schemes.</p><p>In relation to the specific case raised, I wish to advise that section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 specifically provides that my power as Minister to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions shall not be construed as enabling me to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.</p><p>The Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and has included a review of the MTR Scheme for borrowers of private commercial lending institutions as an action in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.  The review will examine what amendments can be made to the scheme to make it work better for borrowers.  My Department has commenced work on scoping the review and in this regard has begun early consultations with key stakeholders.  The review is to be complete by the end of the year.  Any amendments to the MTR Scheme for borrowers of private commercial lending institutions that may result from the review will also be reflected in the LAMTR Scheme, where appropriate and relevant.</p></reply>

Temporary emergency accommodation for the surviving family members has been in place in Ballyogan since shortly after the tragedy.  Following discussions with the family around its preferred options, the Council proposed to develop a permanent four-bay halting site at Glenamuck Road, Carrickmines, which is in accordance with its Traveller Accommodation Programme.  The planning process was completed in July and, following a submission from the Council, my Department has given approval to the Council to proceed to tender.  The Council expects that the accommodation will be ready for these families by mid-2017.</p>  <p>  In addition to the accommodation needs, a number of actions were implemented in the days following the tragedy and there has been on-going engagement with the bereaved and those affected by the events at Carrickmines over the last twelve months.  My Department co-ordinated the State&rsquo;s response across a range of Departments, Agencies and NGOs in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy.  This included D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the Departments of Justice and Equality and Social Protection, the HSE, Traveller Counselling Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and St Vincent de Paul.  This collaborative approach proved very effective in tackling the range of issues faced by the families and in planning for medium and longer term delivery of supports and services.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group, hosted by Southside Traveller Action Group (STAG) and including the Departments, Agencies and NGOs mentioned above, is in place since the tragedy to manage and oversee the response to the immediate and subsequent needs of the bereaved.  This has ensured that vital health, financial and other supports, such as pastoral care and counselling services, were provided as a priority, as well as actions to meet the longer term needs.  Other supports provided by my Department have included practical assistance to Southside Travellers Action Group (STAG) and to Bray Travellers Community Development Group in respect of costs related to, inter alia, provisions, utilities, Counselling Services (including psychotherapy supports for the bereaved children) and media costs.  The costs of the funerals were met on the basis of one third each by my Department, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Social Protection.  The Steering Group remains in place to ensure a continued co-ordinated range of supports is available to support the bereaved families.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the employment supports are of a voluntary nature and are tailored to individual circumstances and a person&rsquo;s capacity to engage with education, training or job-search programmes.</p>  <p>  One of the principal supports is the EmployAbility service, which provides job coach support to people with disabilities in accessing jobs in the open labour market.  Other supports include the provision of employment subsidies through the Wage Subsidy Scheme, workplace adaptation grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities.  Funding is also provided to AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) for the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme, an employment placement programme for graduates with disabilities.  For those in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of 6 months or who are in receipt of invalidity pension and who acknowledge, on a voluntary basis, that they may have capacity to undertake some level of employment, the Department&rsquo;s partial capacity benefit scheme is available to assist them to return to the workplace.</p>  <p>  These supports, which are estimated to cost almost &euro;44 million in 2016, play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Disability allowance (DA) recipients who, on a voluntary basis, wish to take up rehabilitative employment may avail of the DA employment disregard, which allows them to take up work and earn up to &euro;120 per week without their social welfare payment being affected.  Earnings of between &euro;121 and &euro;350 per week are assessed at 50% for means test purposes.</p>  <p>  The measures contained in the strategy seek to address any barriers to employment and improve pathways to work, with the impact on employment building up over time.  Among the DSP commitments contained in the strategy is the setting up of an interdepartmental group, under an independent chair, to review and make recommendations on making work pay for people with disabilities through the examination of the complex interactions between the benefit system, the additional costs associated with work for people with disabilities and net income earnings from employment.</p>  <p>  As part of the CES, the Department is progressively rolling out its full INTREO service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  In such cases, people with disabilities who present at an INTREO Centre will be offered an interview by an employment support officer with a view to agreeing a suitable action plan. In addition, relevant officers in INTREO Centres are being trained to enable them to interact effectively with people with disabilities.  To date, over 60 employment support officers have received this training.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department recently published exploratory research on measuring Quality of Life (QoL) to inform this debate.  The analysis by the ESRI is based on data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions in 2013.</p>  <p>  The researchers defined someone as having a QoL problem if they experience problems on 3 or more of 11 indicators on income poverty, deprivation; financial strain; health problems; mental distress; housing crowding and quality problems; neighbourhood problems; lack of social support; institutional mistrust; and lack of safety.  They found that in 2013 just over a quarter of adults experienced multiple QoL problems.</p>  <p>  The research shows that, in line with national poverty and deprivation measures, older people experience lower levels of QoL deficits than adults under 30.  Young adults are 1.8 times more likely to experience QoL problems than older people.  For younger adults crowded accommodation, housing quality problems, deprivation and financial strain are most important.  In contrast, lack of safety, health and neighbourhood problems are more important to older people.</p>  <p>  The paper highlights the varied challenges facing adults at different stages of their life-course and the importance of multidimensional measures that look beyond peoples&rsquo; income to a more holistic QoL perspective &ndash; to their health, housing, social interactions, living environment and personal well-being.  The updated national action plan for social inclusion identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing poverty and social exclusion.</p>  <p>  The ESRI is undertaking further research on poverty trends and QoL across the life-course, focusing on social risk groups.  My Department will discuss the findings and policy implications arising from this research at a national conference in November.</p></reply>

This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must satisfy a number of criteria.  One of these is that they have at least 520 paid contributions (i.e. 10 years).  However this of itself does not qualify someone for a full rate contributory pension.  As with such pensions in other countries, there is a separate criterion to decide the rate of payment for those who do qualify.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced in this State, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.</p>  <p>  For those who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full State pension (contributory), there are supports available in the overall State pension system which assists qualification for a contributory payment, based on factors such as the contributions made by their spouse, and/or other factors likely to impact upon their needs. These include:</p>  <p>  - The Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.</p>  <p>  - Increases for Qualified Adults.</p>  <p>  - Credits for periods of unemployment and illness. </p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory pension of up to 95% of the full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service, others would have worked abroad and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g., caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances. In some cases, a person might never have been in insurable employment. </p>  <p>  The statistics requested by the Deputy are not available to my Department. </p>  <p>  Any questions regarding the number of public servants affected by the Marriage bar, or the consequent impact to the public service pension provision would be a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.</p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that appeals processing times are continuously monitored and that, although significant progress has been made in recent years, continued improvement in this area remains a priority.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01/01/2015 &ndash;

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-06a.457.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100600054#WRQ01900"><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle long-term unemployment and youth unemployment is to<font color="#FF0000"> </font>create the environment for a strong economic recovery through effective policies.  In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.</p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, both long term unemployment and youth unemployment continue to fall.</p><p>The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.4% in Q2 2016.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 51.1% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.  The number of long term unemployed in Q2 2016 was 95,900; this compares to 204,300 in Q1 2012.</p><p>Youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 15.9% (32,400) in September 2016 (as estimated by CSO), compared to 17.0% (35,200) in August 2016 and a peak of over 31.1% (70,500) in 2012.</p><p>Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate long-term unemployed and young unemployed people find and sustain employment.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).</p><p>A range of measures were introduced under previous Pathways to Work strategies for long-term unemployed people.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath, to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes.  A core focus of Pathways to Work 2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.</p><p>The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015 (see Table 1 attached to this reply).</p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p><p>I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in long term unemployment and youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p></reply>

The scheme supports almost 40,800 lone parents and over 73,500 children.  In addition to this, my Department estimates spending &euro;177 million on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment scheme in 2016.  The scheme supports almost 15,000 lone parents.   The aim of the reforms to the One-Parent Family Payment is to better engage with lone parents to assist in the transition from welfare into employment.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment.</p>  <p>  Access to my Department&rsquo;s Intreo service is critical in achieving this outcome.  Lone parents who transition to jobseeker&rsquo;s transition or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to a Case Officer who assists them in producing a personal development plan.  This tailored plan helps access appropriate education, training and employment support opportunities based on their individual circumstances and requirements.</p>  <p>  The final phase of the one-parent family payment age reforms were introduced on 2 July, 2015 bringing maximum age of the youngest child for receipt of the one-parent family payment to 7 years for all recipients.  Approximately 25,500 customers transitioned from the one-parent family payment scheme on that day.  The majority of customers transitioned to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment and the family income supplement.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this did result in a reduction in payments for some lone parents, who were working while receiving benefits.</p>  <p>  On foot of the measures for lone parents contained in Budget 2016, a lone parent on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment working 15 hours at the national minimum wage saw an increase in their overall income of just over &euro;28 per week (or over &euro;1,450 per annum) from approximately &euro;306 in 2015 to &euro;334 in 2016.  This is as a result of the budget measures and the increase in the national minimum wage.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2016 found that employed lone parents experienced an increase of 2% in their household income while unemployed lone parents experienced an increase of 1.8%.  The cumulative impact of Budgets 2015 and 2016 also shows that budgetary policy increased the average household income of employed lone parents by 2.8%.  This compares favourably to an average household increase of 2%.</p>  <p>  The latest Quarterly National Household Survey for quarter 2 2016 contains information in respect of employment rates by family composition. In the year to the end of June 2016, the number of lone parent families who were in employment increased significantly by 3.6 percentage points to 56.4%.  This represents four times the increase of all adults with children in employment over the same period.  Interestingly lone parents whose youngest child is aged between 6 and 11 years of age experienced the single largest increase in employment.  Over the year the percentage of these lone parents in employment increased by 7.5 percentage points to 57.2%.</p>  <p>  The magnitude of the increase for lone parents specifically, many of whom would have been affected last in July 2015 by the reforms, is clearly significant and cannot be dismissed.</p></reply>

This commitment is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, which makes specific reference to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted in this House on 25 May has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach raised the issue with Prime Minister May at their first meeting in July, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, in each of our contacts since his appointment including at our most recent meeting in Dublin on 13 September.</p>  <p>  In doing so, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to raise this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  The Deputy may also be aware that this matter was discussed at the recent meeting between the Taoiseach and Party Leaders in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  There are of course many families throughout these islands and beyond who continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive and other parties in Northern Ireland, to see how we can to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues.  There remain a number of outstanding issues, but there is an urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Government is continuing to use every possible opportunity to underline our concerns about this case to the Egyptian Government, and also with the EU.</p>  <p>  On 24 September I met with Foreign Minister Shoukry in New York where I again highlighted my concerns at the repeated delays in the court proceedings and reinforced the Government&rsquo;s support for the recent Decree 140 application made by this citizen&rsquo;s lawyers.  Both I and An Taoiseach have communicated our support for this application in writing to Minister Shoukry and President el-Sisi respectively.</p>  <p>  As has been previously reported to the House, An Taoiseach has been in direct contact on a number of occasions with President el-Sisi of Egypt about this case, underlining the Government&rsquo;s concerns about the continuing detention of this young man, who has been in prison for over three years now without having been convicted of any crime, and who is part of a group trial that has been adjourned on fourteen occasions.</p>  <p>  At the last hearing (29 June), the trial was adjourned until early October following an application by defendants for an expert review of the audio-visual evidence in this case.  It was originally anticipated that a technical hearing connected to the audio-visual evidence review would take place on 2 October.  However the hearing did not proceed as 2 October was in recent days designated as the opening day of the Hijra (Islamic New Year) Feast, and a public holiday.</p>  <p>  The Court Office has indicted that the next hearing date is likely to be 12 November and we are awaiting confirmation of this date through official channels.  On Sunday last, 2 October, I spoke directly to Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Ms. Soha Gendi, expressing my concern about further delays and underlined the Government's strong desire to see this citizen returned to Ireland as a matter of urgency.  My officials are continuing to work closely with this citizen&rsquo;s family and with his lawyers in Dublin and Cairo.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I stand ready to further engage with the Egyptian Government as and when appropriate, in line with our key focus of securing this citizen&rsquo;s best interests; this means continuing our determined efforts to see him released by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest possible opportunity and, in the meantime, providing consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.</p>  <p>  All of the sustained and focused actions that have been taken by my Department throughout this case have been aimed at furthering these two objectives, and importantly, avoiding any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to this citizen&rsquo;s best interests.</p></reply>

On 23 March 2006, the Government approved the extension of the &lsquo;Centenarian Bounty&rsquo; scheme whereby persons born on the island of Ireland, who have reached 100 years of age, wherever they may now reside, became eligible for the award of &euro;2,540.  It should be noted that, while the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade processes applications received from outside the State, the decision to award the Centenarian Bounty is the responsibility of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  Once the Department processes an application, a recommendation is made to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in on awarding the Centenarian Bounty.</p><p>From 1<sup>st</sup>January 2011 to 30<sup>th</sup>September 2016 the Department made recommendations to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in for 1,005 bounty recipients resident outside of the State - 14% were men and 86% were women.</p><p>Information on the Centenarian Bounty is available online, particularly through the Department&rsquo;s website and also on the websites of the President and of the Citizens Information Bureau.  The Department also advertises the Centenarian Bounty through its public outreach work and mission network.  The Department does not locate centenarians living abroad and applications are usually made by a close relative of the centenarian or by other people who know them such as a close friend, medical staff or social worker.  Following the first application, centenarian&rsquo;s details are recorded and for all subsequent birthdays a letter and commemorative coin is issued by &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.</p><p>The majority of the recipients processed to date under the extended scheme are resident in Northern Ireland (approximately 55%) with residents of United States (approximately 20%) and people living in England (approximately 18%) accounting for the majority of the other recipients. </p></reply>

The outcome of that review was that the FEMPI provisions impacting on public service pay and pensions continued to make a vital contribution to necessary fiscal consolidation, and that accordingly there was a need to continue to apply those provisions, including the PRD, subject to the amendments effected in the measures through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015.</p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015, which also implements the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA), partially unwinds the pay and pension reductions imposed on serving and retired public servants.  This unwinding includes a significant element of relief in relation to PRD, with entry threshold changes implemented in two stages, 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2017, delivering an annual boost of &euro;1,000 for most public servants.</p>  <p>  My next review and report on the FEMPI legislation is due before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of June 2017, and will then include my assessment in relation to the continued application of PRD. </p></reply>

These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, the development of a basic payment account, the provision of motor tax services, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve.  The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.  A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr Bobby Kerr.  This Group will continue to meet monthly in order to examine the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.</p><p>I have separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group, to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  This group has identified 3 potential options around the hub concept and I expect to be in a position to report back to Government on the work of this group in the near future with a view to establishing a number of pilot projects.</p><p>My officials are also examining the potential for the post offices to deliver services such as motor tax payments and a basic payment account.  My Department is continuing to work closely with Mr Kerr and the Network Renewal Implementation Group to ensure that all actions contained in the final report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group are considered by Government, once sufficiently advanced.</p></reply>

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.</p><p>Key elements of the initiative include:</p><p>- the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million;</p><p>- the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs and Primary Care Teams to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;</p><p>- measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.</p><p>The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  To date 133 people living with dementia have benefitted under the funding allocated from the National Dementia Implementation Programme at an average cost of &euro;1,000 per package per week.  There are currently 72 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE will continue to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources. </p><p>It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. </p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016 provides for a target of 10.4 million Home Help Hours to support about 47,800 people.  It also provides for 15,450<b></b>Home Care Packages<b></b>and<b></b>130<b></b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs.  A further 60<b></b>clients with dementia will be supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.  </p><p>Home support services across the country are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  Activity in the first quarter of 2016 was ahead of the same period last year as efforts continued to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system. </p><p>The Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40m for home care in 2016.  This will ensure that the home support services provided in 2015 are maintained and that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months.  &euro;10m of this money has been ring fenced for home care as part of the new winter initiative.  The targets for 2016 will be reviewed in light of these additional resources.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to increasing provision for home care in the years ahead.  This will be considered in the normal way in the context of each annual Estimates process.</p></reply>

However, the National Suicide Research Foundation recently confirmed that, since 2004, there have been at least 21 murder-suicide cases in this country.  The impact of these events can be devastating, particularly on families and communities. </p><p>The National Suicide Research Foundation has also examined the international research literature in the area of murder-suicide.  The outcomes reveal that:</p><p>- People involved in murder-suicide are most commonly men;</p><p>- The average age of the men involved is 40 and 50 years (age range: 19-86 years);</p><p>- Fathers rather than mothers are more likely to take their own life or attempt suicide after they have taken the live(s) of their spouse/partner and/or child or children.</p><p>Although the available research does not provide information on specific factors associated with murder-suicide, internationally there is consistency with regard to a number of factors that may contribute to an increased risk of the occurrence of these tragic situations:</p><p>- 80% of the persons involved in murder-suicide had a history of psychiatric disorders, in particular depression;</p><p>- 70% of females and 30% of males had previous contact with a psychiatrist or other mental health care professional;</p><p>- Persons involved in murder-suicide show higher rates of prior non-fatal suicidal acts compared to those who take their own lives but not the lives of others;</p><p>- 30% of males had recently experienced a decrease in status at work or job loss;</p><p>- In 90% of murder-suicide cases involving mothers and in 60% of cases involving fathers, a desire to alleviate real or imagined suffering in their children was reported, for example due to a perceived future of shame without them.</p><p>With regard to responding to murder-suicide, in 2011, the National Office for Suicide Prevention published guidelines for responding to situations of murder-suicide and emerging suicide clusters, based on international evidence and best practice.  The guideline document underlines a pro-active approach in that each local health area needs to prepare a response plan that can be activated when these very tragic situations occur.</p><p>I would also mention that where murder-suicide in general is concerned, it is usually far more complicated than a simple analysis that mental illness is the cause.  The murder of a family, particularly where children are concerned, grabs public attention because it is one of the most unthinkable of crimes.  It must be remembered that the vast bulk of people who suffer from mental illness are not violent, and the vast bulk of violent acts are committed by people who are not mentally ill.  Indeed, people with mental illness are more likely to be the victims of crime - not the perpetrators of crime.</p><p>I will raise the question of whether a study into the cases of murder-suicide in this country would be helpful, in the context of other research needs, with the National Office for Suicide Prevention and the National Suicide Research Foundation.</p></reply>

The advent of this transition period was to help to facilitate the switch to the new regulatory framework, which involves non-anonymous gamete and embryo donation for use in donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures. </p>  <p>  The introduction of non-anonymous gamete and embryo donation, through the provisions of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, is in recognition of Ireland's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that a child has a right to know his or her genetic identity. In order to uphold these rights, through the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, it is first necessary for specific preparatory work to be undertaken, for instance, in relation to the establishment and operation of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register and in the preparation of regulations on a range of matters pertaining to DAHR procedures.</p>  <p>  An inherent consequence of the transition period is that it defers when the provisions in the Act relating to parentage following DAHR procedures come into force.  However, the Act includes specific provisions that deal with the parentage of children who were born as a result of a DAHR procedure before the legislation has commenced.</p></reply>

Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available. </p><p>The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  The NCPE used a decision framework to systematically assess whether the drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi).  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its HTA and submitted it to the HSE.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p><p>A summary of the HTA has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: <i></i>.</p><p>The HSE has since had further engagements with the manufacturer in an effort to secure significant price reductions for Orkambi.  The HSE will consider the outcome of these engagements, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll<font color="#1F497D">-</font>out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been well over 100 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months. </p><p>Since the procurement commenced in December 2015, the contract award timeline is being kept under constant review to ensure that the process is robust and delivers effectively and it became apparent earlier this year that further time was needed and this was communicated publically before the Department entered into dialogue with bidders.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given the sensitivity of discussions in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. </p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The task force will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.

It is, therefore, a matter for the Council to determine if it will issue of a public advisory statement ahead of the publication of the draft National Mitigation Plan (NMP).</p>  <p>  Development of the NMP is being guided by a long-term vision of low carbon transition as set out in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development 2014, based on: </p>  <p>  - an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and</p>  <p>  - in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive NMPs is to incrementally achieve this vision by 2050.  The first iteration of the NMP will place particular focus on the putting in place the necessary measures to address the challenge to 2020 and also on planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures are in place beyond that.  Work on this task, which is being co-ordinated by the NMP Steering Group, is well underway by all Departments concerned.  Key sectors in the low carbon transition process - electricity generation, transport, built environment and agriculture - are currently developing sectoral mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes and financial analysis during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.</p>  <p>  In the interests of transparency and inclusiveness, consultation has been a key part of the process to date and a number of non-statutory consultations have already taken place.  Each of the Departments with responsibility for the four key sectors have already undertaken stakeholder participatory initiatives to input into the decision making process on policies and measures to be included in the respective sectoral mitigation measures.  Last year, a consultation document issued informing the public of the context for the NMP, the process by which the NMP was being prepared, the proposed outline structure of the NMP and invited early stakeholder engagement on Ireland's national transition to a low carbon future.</p>  <p>  In terms of statutory consultation, in accordance with Section 4 (8)(a) and (b) of the Act, it is intended to publish a  draft NMP for public consultation before the end of 2016.  In advance of that, in accordance with Sections 4(3)(d) and 4(9)(b) of the Act, the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council and relevant Ministers of Government will be sought in relation to the development of the NMP and associated sectoral mitigation measures.</p></reply>

Accordingly, in a liberalised market I have no plans to introduce legislation on this matter.</p>  <p>  On the question of a tariff payment for energy exported to the grid from micro-generation, as I have previously stated in the House, other than Electric Ireland, to date no other electricity supplier has chosen to provide such a tariff, to either domestic or commercial customers, although they have been invited to do so by the CER.  Any decision by an electricity supplier to offer a tariff payment is a commercial decision for the company. </p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper published last December sets out a high-level framework for Ireland's energy transition to a low carbon economy and society and identifies a range of measures and actions to support this aim.  Exploring the scope to provide support for renewable micro-generation will form part of my Department&rsquo;s on-going analysis to underpin the introduction of a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). </p>  <p>  In-depth analysis is now underway to inform the actual costings of a new Scheme.  While no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, the cost and technical viability of a range of renewable technologies is being assessed, including, for example, micro-generation.  As regards the design of the scheme, options ranging from the payment of support tariffs to up-front grants to deploy renewable energy for self-consumption are under consideration.</p></reply>

Specifically it committed to a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, there have been numerous updates provided in respect of progress.  In April 2014,  the Government decided that it needed to scale up the ambition of the plan.  This was a consequence of the mapping process, which has been underway since 2013, and which demonstrated that there was a significant fibre-deficit across Ireland that this would require a major network build.  It also recognised new State Aid Guidelines published in 2013, a significant ramp-up in demand for data services nationally and internationally, and accelerated industry investment following regulatory and policy decisions, which included legislation to allow ESB to enter the telecoms market.  Facilitating commercial investment continues to be a critical element of the Plan and industry is now delivering to approximately 1.2m premises across Ireland, which represents an increase of at least 200k more homes and businesses than had originally been anticipated.  Telecoms operators are also rolling out fibre-to-the-home services in Ireland - a technology which was not envisaged on any scale in 2012.  At least two operators have announced ambitious fibre-to-the-home roll-out plans, one of which involves the use of the ESB network, which was facilitated by legislation introduced by my Department as part of the broader NBP policy. </p><p>Following the Government's decision to scale up the ambition of the plan, significant additional resources were brought to bear on the project.  Since then, my predecessor and I have held media briefings to flag key milestones in the development of the Plan.  These include:</p><p>November 2014 - the publication of the High Speed Broadband Map and launch of a public consultation<font color="#1F497D">;</font></p><p>June 2015 - the publication of the draft Intervention Strategy along with 7 expert reports which are supporting the delivery of the procurement</p><p>December 2015 - the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map and formal launch of the procurement process, with the publication of a detailed Project Information Memorandum and Project Information Notice in the Official Journal of the EU. </p><p>July 2016 - the decision by Government in relation to the ownership model for the network to be built and the shortlisting of three companies to be brought forward as bidders in the procurement process. </p><p>July 2016- the Programme for Government commits to the establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  The task force, which I co-chair with my colleague, Minister Humphreys, was established in July 2016.The task force has established four sub-groups to examine various aspects of mobile phone and broadband coverage and there have been 10 meetings since July with the next meeting of  the main group scheduled for tomorrow, 7 October 2016.  The task force is making good progress in identifying practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland including access to infrastructure  and network improvement. </p><p>The task force will work with Government Departments, Local Authorities, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the task force will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place. I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the task force's report. </p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that regular progress reports on the development of the plan, at the key milestone stages outlined, is important in order to inform the public of progress.</p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been well over 100 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months.  While the Department had indicated that the process would be concluded in 2016, this has not been possible, due to the complexity of the process.  For example, there were 5 consortia considered during the pre-qualification phase of the procurement, involving over 30 companies, with each potentially bidding for three lots in the procurement process.  This required detailed analysis and companies requested more time at that stage of the process. </p><p>Throughout the process, it was envisaged that contract(s) would be awarded in 2016.  Since the procurement commenced in December 2015, the contract award timeline is being kept under constant review to ensure that the process is robust and delivers effectively.  It became apparent earlier this year that further time was needed and this was communicated publicly before the Department entered into formal dialogue with bidders.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given the sensitivity of discussions in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. </p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

The list of eligible occupations is set out in the Following the introduction of the Employment Permits Online System (EPOS) which enables submission of online applications, permit applications of all types, whether Critical Skills, General or Renewals, etc., are filtered together into two processing queues, i.e., Trusted Partner applications and Standard Employer applications, critical skills permits are processed through both queues.

In particular grants provided to the Agencies of my Department are subject to the standard requirements set down in the Public Financial Procedures concerning any payment from a subhead, namely that they have to be fully vouched and accounted for to the Comptroller and Auditor General and any balance remaining unexpended at the end of the year must be surrendered to the Exchequer.  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a Circular in 2014 regarding the management and accountability of grants to public bodies from Votes of Government Departments.  The Circular in addition to prescribing the basis for the management of grant funding to public bodies also sets out the guiding principles which such bodies should apply in the expenditure of exchequer grants, including the need to achieve value for money.</p>  <p>  In essence the Circular permits the pre-funding of grants to public sector bodies subject to certain provisos.  I would advise the Deputy that a number of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are provided their grants on a pre-funded basis.  The pre-funding of these grants fully complies with the requirements of the 2014 Circular and the monitoring and control arrangements attaching to the pre-funding are available for audit inspection.  I would also advise the Deputy that in instances where Agencies have excess funds on hand at year&rsquo;s end, these are returned to the Department in the following year and returned to the Exchequer as Extra Exchequer Receipts.</p>  <p>  It is also the case that all public bodies, including my Department and its Agencies, are obliged to treat public funds with care, and to ensure that the best possible value-for-money is obtained whenever public money is being spent or invested.  In this regard, I would point out that all of my Department&rsquo;s Voted moneys are subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the management of exchequer funding provided to the Agencies operating under the aegis of my Department fully complies with the requirements of Public Financial Procedures and that the requisite processes are in place to ensure that the best value for money possible is achieved by the Agencies in the expenditure of the grants provided to them.</p></reply>
