The assessment indicates that the programme continues to serve the needs of children who are in need of additional supports to develop to their full potential.  The programme has particular benefits in fostering children's social, emotional and cognitive development, and in engaging parents in their children's learning.  Recommendations are made to strengthen the future operation of the programme.  These include measures to provide professional development opportunities for those working in Early Start units and the establishment of advisory groups in each unit to include parents.</p><p>  Implementation of these recommendations, in partnership with key stakeholders, will ensure that the Early Start programme continues to be my Department's flagship initiative in the pre-school sector.  In the current financial climate there are no plans to extend the programme beyond the 40 units that currently operate in areas of urban disadvantage.</p></reply>

All Hallows is a private college and is not an approved institution under the HEA.   </p><p>  My Department, or the HEA, had no role in the linkage agreement.  However I understand that it comprises collaboration and liaison whilst preserving and reserving the two institutions independent, legal identities.  The Agreement provides that there be exclusivity of accreditation by DCU of all the College's courses leading to credit awards and that DCU shall confer, grant or give degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards to students of All Hallows who satisfactorily complete prescribed courses of study and/or research at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.   </p><p>  Under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012 the relationship between DCU and All Hallows is that of linked provider.</p></reply>

The Authorities in St Patrick's have requested the principal contractor to allow CAS to enter the site and carry out an investigation into these particular allegations.  CAS previously visited the site in October 2013.  It carried out compliance checks at that time.  No major issues were identified.  My Department deals with similar allegations relating to other constructions sites in a similar manner.</p><p>  My Department also contacted NERA in March when the concerns referred to by the Deputy regarding St. Patrick's were originally raised.</p></reply>

The Circular states that for a child to require or qualify for access to SNA support a child must have an assessed disability and the care needs outlined must be of such significance that they are beyond that which would normally be expected to be provided to a child by the child's class teacher, support teacher, or other school teachers, or beyond the level of assistance which could be offered to the student by his/ or her fellow pupils in school.  The Circular provides details of the significant care needs for which SNA support will be provided.</p><p>  Over 10,900 SNAs are being allocated to schools to support children with special educational needs for the coming school year.  This is significantly more than has ever been allocated previously.   All pupils who have been assessed as requiring SNA support to attend school for the coming school year will receive access to SNA support.</p></reply>

Re-engagement, or the formal agreement of quality assurance (QA) with QQI, is a requirement for legacy providers under the 2012 Act.  It will happen only once for a provider; thereafter the provider will have to undergo periodic review of the effectiveness of its QA procedures.  The re-engagement process will allow providers to demonstrate their capacity in respect of the development, ownership and implementation of their QA procedures, including the development of programmes and assessment of learners.  </p><p>  The fees involved have not yet been determined.  I will consider the proposed levels of fee and any associated issues when the proposal is made.</p></reply>

Since the publication of the strategy, there has been 36% growth in full-time non-EEA students in institutions reporting data to the HEA.  The first Higher Education System Performance report published by the HEA notes that "the higher education system is broadly on target to have international students accounting for 15% of total full-time student numbers by 2020."  The HEA also indicates that the system is showing strong alignment with the priority markets set by the High Level Group on International Education, with 45% of international students coming from priority markets.  Particular progress continues to be made in the United States, where Ireland is in the top ten destinations for American students and the top small country destination and Brazil, where we have attracted 3% of all scholarship students under the Science Without Borders programme, again making us the top small country destination.</p><p>  A mid-term review of the international education strategy is being undertaken by my Department and will be published later in the year.</p></reply>

CAS have been requested to carry out an audit of the other site which has been brought to my attention and should irregularities be uncovered in terms of non-compliance with relevant employment law, enforcement and prosecution falls under the remit of NERA and my Department will report any discrepancies found to it.

Applicants had a period of up to 3 years, until 15 December 2005, to apply to the Redress Board.  However, section 8 of the 2002 Act allowed the Board to extend this period in exceptional circumstances.  This power to accept late applications was removed by the Residential Institutions Redress Amendment Act, 2011, with effect from 17th September 2011.</p><p>  By this date, over 5 and half years after the initial closing date, the Board had received 2,766 late applications.  The Board undertook an extensive advertising campaign, using press, television and radio advertising.  It also held information days and distributed leaflets and pamphlets.  It also advertised the final date for receipt of late applications in 2011.</p></reply>

The advice will be delivered in the spring of 2015 and will draw upon findings gathered from the extensive consultation process with parents, schools, professional service providers and other stakeholders which has already commenced and which is ongoing.  The advice will also draw upon new research commissioned by the NCSE for this purpose, as well as any other research which may be available and which the NCSE may wish to consideration. The research commissioned by NCSE is currently under review.  I would encourage all interested parties to contribute to the on-going consultation process for the policy advice. </p><p>  I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

One aspect of the budgetary decisions was to increase the pupil teacher ratio for fee-charging schools.  This reflects the fact that fee-charging schools have resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately.  Given that this is not an option that is available to schools in the free education scheme many would view this approach as more equitable than the approach suggested by the Deputy.  </p><p>  The main priority for any additional resources for the foreseeable future will be to cater for the continuing increase in demographics at all levels in the education system.</p></reply>

My Department recently issued Circular 30/2014, which sets out the purpose of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme.  This Circular also restates the role of the Classroom Teacher in the context of educating pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>  Section 22 (1) of the Education Act 1998 states the primacy of the teacher in the education and personal development of students in schools.  The classroom teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need.  The class teacher has primary responsibility for the progress and care of all pupils in his/her classroom, including pupils with special educational needs.  In providing for a child's care needs, the class teacher may be supported by SNA provision, where necessary. </p><p>  Section 20 1 (F) of the EPSEN Act affords statutory provision to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to assess and review the resources required in relation to special educational provision.  In doing so, the NCSE takes into account professional assessments of care needs, but also considers the whole school environment, observation of a child's interaction in the classroom, and the views of the child's parents, teachers, and National Educational Psychologists, as necessary.  The views of a child's teacher may therefore be taken into account as part of the consideration and assessment process for deciding on the level of SNA support required.  However, it is a matter for the NCSE to review the resources required in a school to support the care needs of qualifying children.</p></reply>

I reported to the House on the outcomes of the Council in a comprehensive statement on 2 July.  The Conclusions adopted by the European Council give a full account of the outcome of discussion and are a public record.  I took an active part in the discussions at the summit representing the Irish positions on the various matters discussed.  While I did not have any separate bilateral meetings, I did of course see all of my colleagues at the meeting.</p><p>  Along with colleagues I was proud to represent Ireland at the commemorative ceremony in Ypres which preceded the European Council meeting.  It was a solemn occasion and a moment to remember all those who perished in the war. </p><p>  The main outcomes of the Summit were the nomination of Jean Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission, agreement on a strategic agenda for the EU for the coming period and the adoption of strong conclusions on Ukraine.  Leaders also agreed Council Conclusions on justice and home affairs, the European Semester, Regulatory Reform, Climate Change and Energy.  In addition, Association Agreements were signed with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia and leaders endorsed candidate status for Albania, the EU&rsquo;s Maritime Security Strategy and the annual report on EU official development assistance. </p><p>  The Strategic Agenda which was agreed by Heads of State and Government is an important document.  It identifies the priorities which will guide the work of the European Union over the next five years across the following five areas: (1) jobs, growth and competitiveness, (2) empowering and protecting all EU citizens,  (3) climate policy, (4) freedom, security and justice, and (5) the EU's external relations.  In this context the need to fully exploit the potential of the single market, including completing the digital single market by 2015, is highlighted.  The Strategic Agenda also recognises the need to tackle poverty and social exclusion.  We have to step up the fight against youth unemployment and seek to unlock opportunities for all.  Overall I am pleased that the Strategic Agenda reflects a clear commitment to strengthening the economic recovery across Europe.  The European Council conclusions also call for the growth supporting potential of the EU&rsquo;s fiscal framework to be used and for best use to be made of the flexibility built into the existing Stability and Growth Pact rules.  This is welcome.  </p><p>  I was pleased to join with my European Council colleagues in welcoming the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Slovakia.  We also noted that the Commission will report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of the EU&rsquo;s governance framework &ndash; the 6 Pack and the 2 Pack - by 14 December 2014.</p><p>  Under the European Semester discussions Heads of State and Government reviewed progress made in the area of regulatory fitness and agreed that this should remain a priority in the work of the EU institutions.  Again I welcome this.</p><p>  Given time constraints the European Council held only a brief discussion of the climate and energy framework for 2020.  Leaders took stock of the work underway to reach agreement at latest by October on the new climate and energy policy framework.  It is clear that a lot of work remains to be done to address the challenges associated with climate change at the EU level.</p><p>  On Energy Security the European Council welcomed the Commission's European Energy Security Strategy (EESS) and held a first discussion on that basis. </p><p>  The European Council also adopted new strategic guidelines on Justice and Home Affairs.  These guidelines were prepared over the last year, including at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 5-6 June, which was attended by Minister Fitzgerald.  Asylum, border management and using information and communication technologies across the EU agencies were some of the issues covered in the guidelines.  They also reaffirm the right of EU citizens to move freely and reside and work in other Member States as a fundamental freedom of the Union, which needs to be protected including from misuse.</p><p>  Finally, the European Council Conclusions note that the UK has raised some concerns related to the future development of the EU and that these concerns will need to be addressed.  The conclusions also note that there are different paths of integration for different countries, allowing those that want to deepen integration to move ahead, while respecting the wish of those who do not want to deepen any further.  The ongoing debate on the EU within the UK is, of course, an issue of real importance for Ireland.  My Government will remain highly engaged in this area.</p></reply>

This decision was taken by way of a Qualified Majority Vote following a discussion chaired by President Van Rompuy.  Two members of the European Council, Prime Minister Cameron and Prime Minister Orban, voted against the proposal.  I was amongst the twenty six Heads of State and Government to vote in its favour.</p><p>  Prior to the European Council and at the summit itself, I affirmed my support for Mr Juncker&rsquo;s candidacy to fellow Heads of State and Government, including Prime Minister Cameron.  I have supported Mr Juncker since his election as EPP lead candidate in Dublin last March and am delighted that agreement was reached on his nomination.  He is a highly experienced and capable individual, with a clear commitment to ensuring the European institutions work effectively to support economic recovery and job creation across the EU, a priority I share. </p><p>  I am, of course, conscious of the reservations that Prime Minister Cameron has expressed about the nomination process, which he raised again at the European Council.  I have made clear that, while I do not share his position, I understand and respect it.</p></reply>

The use of local photographers on international trade missions is required to distribute images to the domestic media to accompany the coverage of domestic journalists who are travelling on behalf of their organisations.  Utilising local agencies is cost efficient and costs are kept to a minimum.  Increasingly my Department utilises its own staff to take photographs in-house, thereby reducing costs.  </p><p>In relation to the EU Presidency costs - as is standard for all Presidencies there is a host photographer to capture the images for the Presidency and to distribute them around the world.  My Department ran a competitive tender process and agreed a contract for a single host photographer for the entire Presidency, specifically for images from 17 major Presidency events in Ireland (the 11 Informal meetings of Ministers taking place in Ireland during the Irish Presidency, as well as the visits in January of President Herman Van Rompuy and the College of Commissioners, and the flag-raising ceremony at the start of the Presidency, the Digital Assembly and the Hunger Conference).

In my address to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on 25 June I condemned this verdict, which amounts to the criminalisation of the legitimate activities of a free press, and represents an unacceptable restriction on freedom of expression and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the Egyptian judicial system.  The situation in Egypt was not on the agenda of the European Council meeting on 26/27 June.  However, the issue was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg which I attended on 23 June.  High Representative Ashton issued a statement after the meeting on behalf of the EU expressing the concern of the Council about the verdicts as well as about the death sentences imposed against more than 180 people following the recent well-publicised trial in Minya, Upper Egypt.  </p><p>  Egypt's new constitution provides guarantees for the fundamental rights of its people which the Egyptian courts, regrettably, do not appear to have fully recognized and vindicated in a number of recent verdicts.  This is deeply worrying to those of us who wish to support Egypt and the Egyptian people in their ongoing difficult transition to democracy.  These concerns have been clearly communicated in our ongoing contacts with the Egyptian authorities, both here and through our Embassy in Cairo, most recently by senior officials in my Department at a meeting with the Egyptian Embassy last week which specifically conveyed my concerns over the recent Al Jazeera verdicts as well as the continued detention of Ibrahim Halawa.</p></reply>

In effect, and despite some nine months of negotiations, there remained a complete absence of trust between them as to the purpose of the talks.  There are at this point no direct moves being made to revive the stalled talks.  The United States mediators have in effect told both parties, in my view quite reasonably, to reflect carefully on the opportunity that may be squandered and the possible costs that could follow.  The recent tragic events in the area surely only underline this message.</p><p>  In recent months the focus in the EU has, of course, been on supporting the then-ongoing talks process.  Following the suspension, however, I believe that the EU needs to fundamentally reappraise its positions on the conflict, particularly in view of the ever-increasing risk of a breakdown of the political path and the risk of renewed large scale violence.  The resumption of substantive talks will continue to be a priority, as only through talks can the occupation and the conflict be ended.  However, in our view the EU also needs to increase pressure on key Israeli actions on the ground which are acting wholly against the prospects of reaching such a political solution.  The publication last week by Ireland and the majority of our EU partners, of advice for businesses and citizens on the risks of commercial involvement with Israeli settlements represents an example of the kind of action we have in mind.  </p><p>  It is intended, subject of course to events, that this discussion will begin at the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 July.</p></reply>

Ireland is playing a significant role in providing assistance through the UN and other agencies delivering vital services to the affected populations.</p><p>The situation in Ukraine, while deeply worrying, does not so far involve a humanitarian crisis of similar proportions.  It has, of course, been high on the agenda at EU and other international meetings I have participated in.</p><p>The situation in South Sudan was discussed in detail at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 17 March 2014.  Subsequently, on 15 May, the African Union and the EU met in Brussels and jointly welcomed the 9 May agreement, urging the parties to fully implement all agreements that have been signed to date.  The Foreign Affairs Council of EU Development Ministers also discussed developments on 19 May.  My colleague, the Minister for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello T.D., highlighted the need for progress by the EU in implementing a comprehensive approach to the political, security, and development crises in South Sudan.  At the South Sudan pledging conference in Oslo on 20 May, Ireland pledged &euro;2million in assistance for the emergency operations of UN and NGO partners.  Our pledge has been fulfilled.</p><p>The deteriorating situation in Iraq is a matter of very serious concern.  There are now almost two million people displaced within Iraq.  The crisis was discussed with EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June, at which the Council agreed Conclusions condemning the recent violent attacks and wide scale reports of atrocities.  The Council also expressed serious concern at the humanitarian situation and the displacement of large numbers of people from their homes.</p><p>Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis.  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, announced a pledge of &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance at the Pledging Conference for Syria in Kuwait in January.  Since 2011, we have provided a total of just over &euro;28 million in humanitarian assistance for victims of the Syrian crisis. </p><p>We have matched our humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis, and we have advocated for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access, as well as for respect by all parties of International Humanitarian Law.  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries, Ireland will continue to call for increased support to the humanitarian relief, as well as for the full and immediate implementation by all parties to the conflict of UN Security Council Resolution 2139 on Humanitarian Assistance in Syria. </p><p>I discussed the humanitarian situation in Ukraine with European colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June.  The Council expressed concern about the rapidly deteriorating human rights and humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, as highlighted by the latest report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  We called on all sides to do their utmost to protect civilians and recalled the importance of allowing humanitarian organizations perform their vital work, guided by the principles of neutrality, impartiality and non-discrimination.  The Council also expressed support for President Poroshenko's peace plan, which I believe provides the best opportunity for progress towards peace and stability in Ukraine.</p></reply>

The plan offers an amnesty to separatists who disarm voluntarily as well as corridors to allow Russian and Ukrainian militants to return to Russia.  It also envisages changes to the Ukrainian constitution to enable the devolution of more power to the regions, as well as greater protection for Russian-language rights.  President Putin expressed qualified support for the plan following its announcement and it has been strongly welcomed by Ireland and its European partners.</p><p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 23 June, EU Ministers expressed their support for the peace plan as a major chance for de-escalation and commended President Poroshenko's determined actions towards peace and stability in Ukraine since his inauguration, against the backdrop of increased violent activities by pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.  At the European Council, which met on 27 June and was attended by the Taoiseach, EU Heads of State and Government also welcomed the peace plan but expressed regret that the ceasefire had not led to the full cessation of military hostilities.  The European Council also noted the Russian President's declaration of support in principle of the peace plan and the Russian Federation Council's decision of 24 June to revoke authorisation that it had previously granted for the use Russian forces to intervene militarily in Ukraine.</p><p>  Due to repeated infringements by pro-Russia separatists, President Poroshenko announced on 30 June that the ceasefire had come to an end.  Since then, there have been intense diplomatic efforts to have the ceasefire reinstated in order to give the peace plan a real chance for success.  Following a meeting in Berlin between the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine on 2 July, an agreement was reached on the resumption of trilateral contact group talks, involving Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE  to pave the way for a new ceasefire.</p><p>  I very much hope that all sides, including Russia, will continue to engage in efforts to make urgent progress towards implementing all aspect of the peace plan, which I believe offers the best opportunity for achieving the peace and stability that we all wish to see in Ukraine.</p></reply>

I have strongly condemned the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls from the northern Nigerian town of Chibok by the terrorist organisation, Boko Haram, on 14 April.  I am also appalled by continuing reports of violent attacks, including further abductions, throughout Nigeria.</p><p>  I have given my full support to the clear demands of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, and the High Representative of the European Union, Catherine Ashton, that the girls abducted in Chibok be released and that those responsible be brought to justice.  I welcome the support now being provided to the Nigerian authorities from a number of our EU partners and from the USA, to help find the missing schoolgirls.</p><p>  On 12 May, the EU Foreign Affairs Council, meeting in Brussels underlined our serious concern at the terrorist attacks in northern Nigeria and strongly condemned the abduction of the schoolgirls and called for their immediate and unconditional release.  The Council emphasised the EU's readiness to support the Nigerian authorities in the resolution of this crime and their ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism in all its forms, in full respect of human rights.  On 26 May, the EU agreed to fund a further series of measures, including the provision of technical assistance to the Office of the National Security Advisor to implement and coordinate counter terrorism legislation and crisis management structures, and to develop capacity to address the issue of increasing radicalisation and recruitment. </p><p>On 22 May, the UN Security Council Al Qaida Sanctions Committee approved the addition of Boko Haram to its list of individuals and entities subject to targeted financial sanctions and an arms embargo.  With effect from the 29 May, the EU added Boko Haram to the lists of groups covered by the freezing of funds and economic resources.   </p><p>  Our Embassy in Abuja, working in cooperation with EU and other key partners, is in close contact with the Nigerian authorities, who have the primary responsibility for the resolution of the case of the missing school girls and to address the broader security situation.  Our Ambassador in Abuja has participated in discussions among local EU Heads of Mission, which are advising on the EU's next steps in the area.  We will continue to support every effort being undertaken by the Nigerian Government to counter radicalisation and terrorism within its borders, to resolve the specific case of the abducted schoolgirls and to promote full respect for human rights.</p></reply>

The nature of conflict is very different from when the UN was founded, and it is important that structures be amended to reflect this.</p><p>  Ireland participates in the informal plenary sessions of the 10th round of Intergovernmental Negotiations on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council. Ireland has called for these discussions to be intensified with a view to identifying whether there is a model for reform which can command broad consensus.  Ireland is a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) grouping at the UN, launched in May 2013 in New York. It is a cross-regional group of 21 states aiming to improve the working methods of the UN Security Council. Ireland also actively participates in the ACT sub-group on peacekeeping.</p><p>  Ireland has made a significant contribution to new UN Structures.  Ireland's Ambassador was one of three Permanent Representatives to the United Nations who were appointed to facilitate a review of the Peace Building Commission in December 2009.  The outcome of this review was the approval in 2010 by the UN Secretary-General of the co-facilitator's report which sought to reinvigorate the Peacebuilding Commission. </p><p>  On peacekeeping, Ireland is currently participating in a UN initiative to improve standards which guide the operation of UN peacekeeping missions.  The initiative allows us to share the significant expertise we have gained through our longstanding participation in UN peacekeeping missions in order to develop best practices at UN missions.  Ireland also hosted a panel discussion on command and control structures for UN peacekeeping operations on 3 July.</p></reply>

Ebola patients have been identified in more than 60 separate locations across the three countries.  Latest reports from the World Health Organisation (WHO) state that there have been 427 deaths across West Africa.</p><p>  The international response to the outbreak is being coordinated by the WHO, which has deployed 150 experts to the three countries.  These experts have been supporting the Ministries of Health to contain the outbreak and assist those suffering from the virus.  An emergency regional meeting took place in Accra last week, involving West African Ministers of Health, Ebola and public health specialists and representatives from UN agencies, the European Union, bilateral donors and NGOs. The meeting focused on cooperation strategies to tackle the regional outbreak.</p><p>  There is great concern about the regional spread of the outbreak to Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are partner countries for Ireland's aid programme.  There are now 221 confirmed cases of the virus in Sierra Leone, of which 67 have resulted in death.  Since the outbreak was confirmed in late May, the Government of Sierra Leone and its development partners have taken clear practical measures in response, in line with best practice.  Efforts are also underway to improve public understanding of the symptoms and effects of the virus and to build public cooperation with the Ebola response. </p><p>  In Liberia, the Ebola outbreak was considered to have ended by early June, but there was a second outbreak on 10 June.  There are now 48 confirmed cases in Liberia, of which 33 have resulted in death.  The Government of Liberia, supported by development partners, has reactivated the Ebola response plan put in place during the initial outbreak.  Ireland provides substantial support to Liberia's Ministry of Health under our aid programme, and the Irish Aid office in Monrovia is actively monitoring the situation and regularly liaising with Government and other development partners.</p><p>  Ireland has also provided &euro;60,000 to the NGO Concern Worldwide for their programme which aims to prevent the spread of Ebola through community sensitisation and health and hygiene awareness in Sierra Leone and Liberia.  In addition, the START fund, an innovative fund mechanism for NGOs, which is supported by Irish Aid, has provided &euro;350,000 to Concern, Christian Aid, Save the Children and ActionAid for their response to the Ebola outbreak.  </p><p>  Our Embassy in Freetown is continuing to monitor and report on the situation and is engaged in urgent coordination efforts with Governments and other UN, EU and NGO partners.</p></reply>

All of these conflicts, and wider unrest across the region, have occupied a significant proportion of the agenda at both UN and EU level for a long time.</p><p> The most serious of these situations is the full scale civil war in Syria.  Efforts to resolve this situation have been focussed primarily at the UN, including the activity of joint special envoys of the UN Secretary General and the Arab League.  These efforts have so far been unsuccessful, due to the attitude of the parties in Syria, the inability of the Security Council to agree on how to resolve the conflict politically, and the influx of fighters, weapons and other support into the conflict from outside.</p><p>  The crisis in Iraq has erupted suddenly from a growing security problem to a full blown conflict, with large areas of the country falling under the control of the radical ISIS movement and groups allied to it.  I have reported recently to the D&aacute;il on the discussions on Iraq at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June, and the EU position set out in the Conclusions of that Council. While there will clearly have to be some security response to the crisis by the Iraqi Government, Ireland has stressed that any such response must be measured and proportionate, and moreover that security measures will not succeed unless they are accompanied by a more inclusive political outreach than has been practised by the Iraqi Government thus far.</p><p>  In recent weeks there has also been growing concern about the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, following a dreadful series of murders of Israeli and Palestinian youths, and what seemed to threaten a possible spiral of sectarian violence.  This remains a serious concern, and one that we are watching closely.  Statements by myself, by EU High Representative Ashton and by others, have all stressed the need for all parties to avoid inflaming the situation, leading to any further loss of life.  Thankfully, and despite some emotional calls for revenge on both sides, there are indications that leaders in both communities are attempting to avoid such an escalation and, in particular, to agree a ceasefire in respect of Gaza.  But this will remain a situation requiring close observation.</p></reply>

I have also raised my concerns at this individual's continued detention without trial with the then Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, on 11 November and 23 December 2013.  I followed up these phone calls with a letter to Minister Fahmy in January, expressing my continued concern at this individual's detention.  The Minister for European Affairs Paschal Donohoe, T.D. met with Foreign Minister Fahmy, on 11 June 2014 in Athens, on the margins of the EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting.  The Minister raised the ongoing detention of the individual and requested that all appropriate assistance might be provided to him and his family arising from our serious concerns over his case.</p><p>  From the outset, Ambassador Isolde Moylan and her colleagues in the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo have been in sustained and direct contact with the Egyptian authorities in relation to the case and contacts have included numerous meeting at Ambassadorial level with senior officials from the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice and the office of the Prosecutor General.  Also, on 12 March 2014, the Minister for Justice wrote to the Egyptian Minister for Justice Abdel-Moneim Othman, raising the Government's concerns at the individual's situation and requesting the opportunity to speak about this case as soon as possible. </p><p>  I have worked with the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, to ensure maximum engagement at EU level.  As advised already, as recently as 9 May, I wrote to Ms. Ashton to raise this case.  At my request, Minister of State Paschal Donohoe, T.D. raised this individual's case in person with High Representative Ashton at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 12 May.  High Representative Ashton had confirmed that the EU is both acutely aware of, and closely monitoring, this individual's situation.  The European External Action Service delegation in Cairo has raised the case during official contacts.  The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, mentioned the case during separate meetings with the Egyptian Foreign Minister and the Prosecutor General in Cairo on 9 February.      </p><p>  From the beginning, the Consular Section in my Department has been actively liaising with the family of this individual and the Head of Consular Section in Dublin met with family representatives on 17 August, 19 September, 24 October and 16 December 2013, 16 January, 6 March, 1 and 21 May 2014.  Also, the Embassy in Cairo has been allowed regular consular access to this individual and consular visits were made by the Embassy on 24 August, 8 September, 15 September, 10 October, 24 October, 30 October, 10 November, 21 November, 3 December and 18 December 2013 and 8 January, 26 January, 13 February, 23 March, 9 April, 5 May, 9 June and 1 July 2014.   </p><p>  In all dealings with the authorities the Embassy has sought to stress the individual's young age, the length of time he has already been in detention, and the necessity for him to return to Ireland as soon as possible to continue his studies for his Leaving Certificate examination as mitigating factors in his case in addition to the fact that his three sisters who were part of the same case and with him when he was arrested have already been allowed to return to Ireland.  However, as you will be aware, the individual named is still before the judicial system in Egypt and we are precluded from getting involved in the judicial process.</p><p>  Let me assure you that I continue to remain seriously concerned at the continued detention of this individual and have directed that the Irish Embassy in Cairo and the Consular Assistance Section at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue to give all appropriate consular assistance.</p></reply>

Major seizures included:</p><p>  - 32.3 million cigarettes at Drogheda Port on 24 June 2014,</p><p>  - 10.4 million cigarettes at Dublin Port on 12 July 2013,</p><p>  - 10 million cigarettes at Dublin Port on 17 September 2013, and</p><p>  - 1.17 million cigarettes at Ashbourne, Co. Meath, on 17 July 2013.</p><p>  I would like to congratulate the Revenue Commissioners on the recent major seizure at Drogheda, which included 4.5 tonnes of water pipe tobacco as well as 32.3 million cigarettes, and is the largest in Europe to date this year. I understand that this intelligence-led operation targeted the criminal activities of an international organised crime group headed up by Irish and UK nationals and based in Europe, and that the seizure represents a significant blow to them. Revenue worked in close cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with law enforcement agencies across several jurisdictions, including Slovenia and Portugal, and the successful outcome of the operation is a tribute to the positive engagement by all the agencies concerned.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners advise also that combating the illegal tobacco trade will continue to be a high priority for them. This work includes a wide range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.</p><p>  In addition, legislative action has been taken over recent years to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners have the requisite powers to respond effectively to the problem of the illegal tobacco trade. The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products. The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences for involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production.  Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production.  That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.  </p><p>  As well as those changes to primary law Ireland, in accordance with EU Directive 2008/118/EU, introduced a quantitative restriction, with effect from 1 January 2014, on the number of cigarettes that may be brought into the State for personal use by individuals travelling from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania.  The Excise Duty on Cigarettes (Quantitative Restrictions) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 553 of 2013) provides that the number of tax-paid cigarettes that may be brought into Ireland for personal use by individuals travelling from those Member States, without payment of further excise duty in Ireland, is restricted to 300.  Anyone with cigarettes in excess of that quantity must declare them to a Revenue Officer and pay the appropriate excise duty.  This restriction will remain in place until 31 December 2017 or until such time as the particular Member State has achieved the required EU minimum tax levels, whichever is the earlier.  </p></reply>

The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed. Under the Disability Act 2005 disability means &quot;a substantial restriction in the capacity of an individual to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.&quot; </p><p>Section 10B of the LPT Act provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Injuries Board (formerly known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board) or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals. In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption only applies where the cost of the adaptation work exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it was adapted. </p><p>Entitlement to the exemption provided for in section 10B will depend on whether the extent of a person's disability is such that they are permanently and totally incapacitated from being able to maintain themselves. &quot;Maintain&quot; in this context means a person's ability to support themselves by earning an income from working. Total incapacity in this context means that the individual is not capable of earning a living from any kind of work.  The incapacity must also be permanent, that is, there must be no prospect of the individual recovering, or of the condition improving, to the extent that they become capable of maintaining themselves.</p><p>I am also advised that whether households, where high level care is provided, qualify for relief under section 15A, or for exemption under section 10B, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that following representations and a review of the reliefs, I announced on 2 May 2014 that I intend bringing forward legislation amending section 15A to remove the requirement that any adaptation work on the residential property must be grant-aided, or has been approved for grant-aid, by a local authority as one of the qualifying conditions for the tax relief.  I also intend to remove the requirement, by way of legislation amending section 10B, that a permanent and totally incapacitated person must have benefitted from a Court or Injuries Board award or a public trust fund, to qualify for the exemption.</p><p>My officials wrote to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners advising her of my intention to retrospectively amend the legislation. In view of this, the Chairman has advised me that Revenue will apply the exemption and the tax relief in line with the proposed revised legislation.  The Commissioners have published detailed guidelines which describe how a residential property qualifies for the reduction in market value or the exemption under the new arrangements, and how liable persons should make their application to Revenue. The Guidelines are available on their website at: . </p><p>Under the new arrangements, applications for the reduction in market value should be made on . Applications for the exemption should be made on  or, where the application concerns a permanently and totally incapacitated child for whom the Department of Social Protection pay a Domiciliary Care Allowance  should be completed. Applications should be sent to the Revenue Commissioners, LPT Branch, PO Box 1, Limerick. I am informed that Revenue will examine each application and may seek additional information if considered necessary before determining whether the person is entitled to a reduction in the market value of the property or to the exemption, whichever one is being claimed. </p><p>The Commissioners have also advised that no further action is required where a property previously qualified for the reduction in the market value under the LPT legislation and the liable person declared the reduced valuation when filing the 2013 LPT1 Return. Similarly, no further action is required where a property previously qualified for the exemption and the exemption was claimed when filing the 2013 LPT1 Return.  The reliefs will continue to apply for all years up to 2016, inclusive.</p><p>I have no plans for the further extension of exemptions in relation to the above issues.</p></reply>

In general, landlords can already claim a deduction in their accounts and for tax purposes for expenses incurred on the maintenance of investment properties. As a result, to provide relief under the HRI on such monies would constitute double relief.</p><p>  In addition, if the works carried out result in the landlord suffering a loss in the tax year, such losses can be carried forward and offset against future tax liabilities. Accordingly, works carried out which are paid for by landlords cannot qualify for the HRI.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, rent supplement is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. Therefore, any suggestions in relation to rent supplement should be directed to the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

The incentive to homeowners is by way of a tax credit on works qualifying for VAT at the rate of 13.5% where they engage tax compliant contractors to carry out the renovation works. The tax credit is granted over the two years following the year the work is carried out and paid for, and an online system to enable homeowners to claim the credit will be available in January 2015. </p><p>The level of HRI activity is significant with the total number of works recorded on the Home Renovation Incentive System (HRI online) as at 6<sup>th</sup>July 2014 being 6,862 for a total estimated value of &euro;114.9m carried out by 2,014 tax compliant contractors.  A breakdown by county is as follows (some counties have been merged because of the relatively small numbers of properties involved for confidentiality purposes):<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of Works</th><th>Estimated Value of Works</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>1,195</td><td>&euro;24,889,823</td></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown</td><td>1,072</td><td>&euro;22,079,342</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>733</td><td>&euro;11,476,696</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td>700</td><td>&euro;10,695,555</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>662</td><td>&euro;10,353,766</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>350</td><td>&euro;4,921,278</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>255</td><td>&euro;3,596,299</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>232</td><td>&euro;3,786,875</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>184</td><td>&euro;2,633,173</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>181</td><td>&euro;2,390,634</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>174</td><td>&euro;2,340,355</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow, Laois, Offaly</td><td>122</td><td>&euro;1,267,935</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>118</td><td>&euro;1,466,754</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon, Leitrim, Donegal</td><td>117</td><td>&euro;1,584,432</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>102</td><td>&euro;1,514,976</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>102</td><td>&euro;1,230,647</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>101</td><td>&euro;1,735,597</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>96</td><td>&euro;1,973,708</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>94</td><td>&euro;1,079,955</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>80</td><td>&euro;1,288,007</td></tr><tr><td>Longford, Cavan, Monaghan</td><td>67</td><td>&euro;654,989</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>63</td><td>&euro;1,437,098</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>62</td><td>&euro;568,531</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>6,862</td><td>&euro;114,966,425</td></tr></table></p><p>It should  be noted that the estimated value of works can contain elements which will not qualify for the tax credit such as supplies at 23% VAT and works that exceed the upper limit of &euro;30,000 (before VAT). </p><p>The introduction of HRI has seen an increase in home renovation activity and is contributing to a gradual pick up in employment and self employment activity in the construction sector. Contractors who have been out of the system should avail of the opportunities that HRI presents by ensuring their VAT and RCT registrations are active and tax affairs are up to date </p><p>I was very clear at the outset that the Incentive should support the legitimate trade and improve the competitiveness of legitimate contractors against those operating in the shadow economy.  A key design feature of HRI is that it is based on an online contract and payment notification system that allows the contractor record the details of the work carried out and the payments made, as they are happening.  The system also allows the homeowner check that the details are recorded and once they are recorded on the system the homeowner can be assured that the contractor is a legitimate tax compliant contractor.  </p><p>The construction sector has gone through an unprecedented collapse.  Data from Revenue's online Relevant Contracts Tax (eRCT) system first indicated a pick up in the sector in the spring of last year. HRI online is now showing a pick up in activity in the home renovation sector.  Both eRCT and HRI online will give a comprehensive overview of activity in the construction sector and will enable Revenue to develop additional compliance programmes to identify shadow economy activity within the construction sector.  In this regard this is an opportune time for contractors who are operating in the shadow economy to register for tax purposes and to regularise their tax affairs and avail of the opportunities that will continue to come on stream in the construction sector.</p><p>It is also opportune to remind Homeowners who get work done by contractors, 'off the books', that they pay VAT on all materials used in the work so in reality a 'cash job' is never really 'VAT free', that they face additional risks in terms of consumer protection and that they may be facilitating tax evasion.</p></reply>

When establishing the Council, I stated that the Council would be an independent body whose existence and independence would be underpinned by legislation to be brought forward by Government in the Fiscal Responsibility Bill. The Chairman did not undergo interview by Oireachtas Committee but the Fiscal Council appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on a number of occasions to discuss their fiscal assessment reports. I appointed the members having regard to a number of criteria, including the desirability of having a mix of appropriate backgrounds (academia, the financial sector/financial markets and public finance), macroeconomic/microeconomic expertise and a strong international dimension, as well as the need to take gender considerations into account.  I am satisfied that the appointed members have the mix of skills and experience, including in relation to fiscal affairs, to ensure that the Council will be highly effective in fulfilling its mandate.  The Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 was brought into legislative effect on 27th November 2012. The Council commenced on a Statutory basis from the 31st December 2012.  The membership remains the same as above.</p></reply>

A further 400 cases are entitled to deferral under one of the other categories for deferral, principally the Income Threshold deferral.  Some 900 applications have not been granted as they do not meet the qualifying criteria and the relevant applicants have been notified.

Revenue's commitment in this regard is clearly obvious given that it is currently providing phased payment concessions to almost 16,000 taxpayers/businesses covering approximately &euro;123m of debt in preference to using debt collection/enforcement powers.</p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that it uses six 'external' solicitor firms to assist it in debt recovery through the Courts. The six firms who are selected through a competitive tendering process operate on the basis of six year contracts. The 'external' solicitors dealt with 5,335 Revenue referrals in 2013 and collected &euro;38.3m of outstanding tax debt on behalf of the Exchequer.</p><p>  Revenue has also confirmed to me that it uses the services of 16 Sheriffs, in addition to the 'external' solicitors to assist in its debt recovery operations. The Sheriffs are not appointed by Revenue and are in fact officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945. Their debt collection activities are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, (as amended) and the execution of Revenue referrals (warrants) is specifically provided for in Section 960L of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended. </p><p>  The Sheriff is Revenue's preferred enforcement option because it can be quickly activated in comparison to the Courts process and because it is cost effective for the Exchequer, in that all fees/costs are levied on the defaulting taxpayer. The Sheriffs dealt with 28,795 Revenue referrals in 2013 and collected &euro;150.3m of outstanding tax debt on behalf of the Exchequer.</p><p>  All Revenue debt collection caseworkers operate to very strict guidelines in deploying debt collection/enforcement powers against defaulting taxpayers and the activities of both the Solicitors and Sheriffs are monitored at individual case level to ensure proper procedures are followed in every instance. </p><p>  Finally, I am happy that Revenue deploys its debt collection/enforcement agents in a very careful and considered way and I commend it for the manner in which it correctly balances the use of such powers between protecting the Exchequer, maintaining a 'level playing field' for the vast majority of taxpayers and working pro-actively with businesses/taxpayers that are willing to engage.</p></reply>

However, by way of general comment, Section 10 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) made provision for a number of exemptions from Local Property Tax (LPT).  The exemptions include certain unfinished housing estates, which are prescribed (as unfinished) by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 91 of 2013.  The 'prescribed list' was published in March 2013 and can be viewed at .  It is important to be aware that, in line with Government policy, only properties appearing on the 'prescribed list' are entitled to exemption from LPT and Revenue has no discretion in this regard.</p><p>Also, it does not follow that properties, which are exempt from the Household Charge (HHC) are automatically included in the 'prescribed list' for LPT as the qualifying criteria in respect of both exemptions are not the same.  For example, certain properties and estates that were listed as exempt from HHC on the basis of being 'unfinished' and which were subsequently further developed in the period up to March 2013 were excluded from the LPT 'prescribed list' by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This had the effect of very significantly reducing the number of exemptions in respect of LPT in comparison to HHC.</p><p>In regard to the issue raised by the Deputy, the vendor of a residential property is obliged, in advance of any sale, to submit all LPT Returns and pay all liabilities due for the period/s that he/she was the liable person.  The vendor must also correct any Return where there was an under-declaration of value, or where an exemption was incorrectly claimed and must provide the purchaser with full details of the declared valuation or exemption claimed.  To assist vendors in ensuring LPT has been correctly applied, Revenue has developed an intuitive online system that allows self-correction and payment of any under-valuation errors in advance of a sale.  This facility can be accessed through the LPT page on the Revenue website at using the relevant Property ID and PIN codes.</p><p>The purchaser on the other hand must ensure that he/she receives this information in advance of closing any sale and from it, be in a position to satisfy himself/herself that there are no outstanding LPT liabilities, including any interest or penalties.  With regard to HHC (as distinct from LPT), where an exemption was in place on foot of an unfinished estate, then the vendor should have in his/her possession a 'Certificate of Discharge', which would have been provided by the relevant Local Authority and must be in a position to pass this 'confirmation of exemption' to the purchaser before the completion of sale.  Where any purchaser who acquires a property and subsequently discovers that the vendor supplied Revenue with false information in regard to the valuation or the exemption, then he/she should immediately advise LPT Branch of the details.  In such circumstances, assuming that the purchaser did not agree to pay any outstanding balance as part of the sale agreement, the vendor may be liable to a penalty equal to the amount of the outstanding LPT, in addition to paying the balancing amount, up to a maximum of &euro;3,000.  The purchaser could also become liable for the same penalty in circumstances where he/she is aware that the vendor supplied false information but fails to notify Revenue.</p><p>Revenue has stressed to me the important role that solicitors, whether representing vendors or purchasers in the conveyancing process, must play in respect of LPT.  It is incumbent on them to ensure that LPT has been correctly declared and paid on any property before it is sold/purchased thereby protecting their clients from the imposition of any additional costs including interest or penalties for non-compliance with LPT obligations.  Finally, Revenue has advised me that it has published detailed guidelines on its website in regard to the obligations of vendors and purchasers in respect of Local Property Tax (LPT), which may be of assistance to the Deputy or the person in question.  Alternatively, if the Deputy or the person in question wishes to provide specific details of the property in question then Revenue will be in a position to provide a more precise response. </p></reply>

To clarify, NAMA did not sell the property in question.  The property was sold by its owner and NAMA, as secured lender, consented to the sale.  The salient facts are that Dublin Port Company (DPC) had a shared legal interest in the property and built-in pre-emption rights in respect of the legal interests held.  Given the existence of these legal rights and DPC's expressed interest in acquiring the property, the only commercially viable option was the sale of the property to DPC.  I am advised that the final sale price was the result of extensive negotiations, was in line with market valuations at the time of the transaction and was the best price that could be achieved given the particular circumstances of the asset.</p><p>In addition, I am also advised that the sale proceeded in accordance with the NAMA Board commitment to give first option to State bodies (Government departments, local authorities, State agencies and other statutory bodies) on the purchase of NAMA-related property which may be suitable for their purposes.  This is fully in line with Government policy.  In accordance with that Board commitment, NAMA has accommodated the sale or lease of lands and properties for a range of public uses, including, for instance, for social housing, primary and secondary schools, primary healthcare and other step-down and community healthcare facilities, and for community and recreational amenity.  I fully support the NAMA Board in this approach.</p><p>As a secured lender, before NAMA agrees to release its security it makes all necessary enquiries to ensure that full value is obtained in the interest of taxpayers.  NAMA has published guidance on the 'Disposal of Real Estate Assets by NAMA Debtors and Insolvency Office Holders'.  This is available on the NAMA website, .  I refer the deputy to PQ no. 206 of the 17th of June 2014 which outlines the valuation methodology applied by NAMA.</p></reply>

Under the Relationship Framework PTSB is recognised as a separate economic unit with independent powers of decision.  The Board and management team retains responsibility and authority for determining the bank's strategy and commercial policies and conducting its day-to-day operations.  In accordance with Section 21 of the Relationship Framework I have been notified by PTSB that Morgan Stanley have been engaged to act on their behalf solely to facilitate the sale of the specified loan books only and not to advise on any other aspects of their strategy.</p><p>  I have also been informed by PTSB that Morgan Stanley were chosen after a thorough competitive tender process taking into account their experience in similar transactions and their track record on previous transactions for PTSB.

In making such decisions the Board and management teams are highly conscious of ensuring that sale costs are minimised and that maximum proceeds are achieved in the sale of all loan portfolios.

As the Deputy may be aware, towards the end of last year, my Department undertook an assessment of banks' fee income relative to peers in selected other jurisdictions and carried out a review of the regulation of bank fees.  The review concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 now.  Specifically, in relation to competition, the review found that the lack of competition in the banking sector means that the removal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.  This issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.</p><p>  As part of the conditions under which the Irish banks received state aid, Ireland made various 'sectoral commitments' to the European Commission in order to promote competition in the Irish banking sector.  Among these commitments, Section 1.1 (b) of the approved State Aid for Bank of Ireland states: &quot;Legislation will be enacted that will provide that Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 regarding price regulation and fees will not be applied to new entrants in their first 3 years of commencing business in Ireland&quot;.  This exemption was provided for under the Central Bank Supervision and Enforcement Act 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that Bank of Ireland announced on 26 June last that it had agreed to sell the distribution platform, together with &euro;250 million of mortgage assets at par, to Dilosk Limited.  No deposits are transferring as part of the sale.  That follows an amendment to the bank's restructuring plan which allowed the bank to retain its life assurance subsidiary, New Ireland.  The bank committed to certain substitution measures including the sale of the ICS distribution platform together with, at the option of the acquirer of the platform, up to &euro;l billion of mortgage assets and a similar quantum of matching deposits.  The purpose of the ICS substitution measure is to support new entrants in the Irish mortgage market thereby increasing competition to the benefit of the consumer.</p><p>  Dilosk Limited has confirmed that it has applied for authorisation from the Central Bank of Ireland to operate as a retail credit firm and once it is so authorised, it will be required to comply fully with all relevant consumer protection codes, including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  Mortgage holders will therefore be afforded protection.  Given the reduced number of lenders now operating in the mortgage market, this transaction is to be welcomed as it introduces a new entrant and should therefore contribute to greater competition.</p></reply>

The report also provides a breakdown of the percentage distribution of properties across the 20 valuation bands nationally (based on Returns filed for 2013) and shows that about 54% of all residential properties were valued on a self-assessment basis at &euro;150,000 or less.

This figure does not include local authority (or similar) owned properties which are deemed to be valued, under LPT legislation, in LPT Valuation Band 1.</p><p>While the vast majority of Band 1 and 2 properties would be principal private residences, I am informed by the Commissioners that further analysis would be required to provide an exact figure.  The Commissioners have confirmed that by the end of December 2013, &euro;318m had been transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer in respect of LPT.  Of this amount, &euro;242m was in respect of LPT for 2013 and &euro;76m relates to 2014 LPT.  By the end of June 2014, a further &euro;310m was transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer.  The Commissioners advise that they do not have per capita figures as data are not held on that basis.  Projected LPT for 2014, broken down by local authority, is not currently available.

Irish Pound coin to the value of &euro;124 million is still in circulation and is redeemable by the Central Bank on behalf of the Minister for Finance.

The bulk of debt servicing costs is made up of National Debt interest.  The Budget 2014 estimate of National Debt interest in 2014 was &euro;8,154 million.  The other items comprising debt servicing are sinking funds and debt management expenses.  These were estimated in Budget 2014 at &euro;633 million and &euro;139 million respectively.</p><p>  The end-June 2014 Exchequer Returns published last week reported National debt interest expenditure at &euro;4,297 million in the first six months of the year, some &euro;346 million or 7.5% below the Budget 2014 consistent profile.  This is largely due to the &euro;4.1 billion bond buy back in December 2013, which resulted in lower interest payments in January 2014, lower than expected costs from bond issuance so far this year and a more benign interest rate environment generally, including with respect to the interest rate reset on the floating rate bonds, reflected in the June payment.</p><p>  Sinking Funds and debt management expenses were &euro;600 million and &euro;48 million respectively in the first six months of the year.  National Debt service costs for the year are likely to be below the original Budget 2014 estimate.  This was reflected in the April 2014 Stability Programme Update which projected total National Debt service costs interest, sinking funds and debt management expenses combined at &euro;8,514 million in 2014, some &euro;412 million below the Budget 2014 estimate.  The next published estimate of National Debt service costs in 2014 will be in the context of Budget 2015 in October.</p></reply>

The recent Quarterly Economic Commentary Special Article by Bergin and FitzGerald outlining the limitations of the EU harmonised approach to estimating the output gap is a welcome addition to discussions on this important issue.</p><p><b>Definition used</b></p><p>As official publications from this Department have repeatedly highlighted, the harmonised EU approach is not well suited to  capturing in full the dynamics of the Irish economy.  For the purposes of assessing compliance with EU fiscal rules, however, all Member States must apply the standard methodology as outlined in detail in D'Auria et al. (2010), together with the recent modifications to how the level of structural unemployment is estimated (as outlined in the April 2014 Stability Programme Update).  Official estimates of the structural budget balance submitted to the European Commission for assessment must comply with this definition.  The definition used by my Department thus follows the above approach where potential output corresponds to the level of output consistent with price and labour market equilibrium.  As the ESRI paper highlights, this approach does not directly incorporate imbalances in the goods market captured through the current account.  Movements in terms of trade, however, do feature in how the level of structural unemployment is modelled under this approach.  My Department shares the view that the requirement to deliver continued structural adjustment following this harmonised approach will imply sustaining a significant current account surplus over time.</p><p><b>Appropriateness of approach</b></p><p>There are a number of well-flagged limitations to this methodology: namely the implausibly high levels of structural unemployment the approach implies, and the tendency for these estimates to be revised over time.  Whilst all estimates of the output gap are prone to revision (since they are, by definition, based on unobserved trends), the extent of these revisions remains a source of concern.</p><p><b>Actions taken</b></p><p>My Department continues to monitor the implications of applying this harmonised methodology in Ireland.  At EU working group level, my staff have been closely involved in lobbying for and successfully implementing improvements in how structural unemployment is calculated under the harmonised approach.  Notwithstanding these improvements, my Department still views the implied rate of the latter for Ireland as both implausibly high and overly cyclical in nature.</p><p>My Department will continue to lobby to improve the fit of the harmonised methodology for Ireland.  In this regard, I welcome the forthcoming report by the European Commission to the European Parliament on the application of the EU governance framework in December 2014.  At technical level, my Department will continue to engage actively in this report process.</p><p><b>Position of structural balance</b></p><p>Whilst my Department is of the view that the output gap is likely to be more negative than that currently implied by the standardised methodology, it does not share the view outlined in the paper that all of the 2014 deficit (-4.8% of GDP) is due to the effects of the economic cycle.  For this to be the case - consistent with the harmonised methodology - this would imply an equally implausible negative output gap of 9 1/2 % of GDP.</p><p><b>Implications for EU commitments</b></p><p>Estimation of the structural balance has assumed a central role in the domestic conduct and European assessment of fiscal policy.  It will become even more central to Irish policy decisions once we are subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact from 2016 onwards.  Ireland will then be obliged to deliver a correction in the structural balance of at least 0.5 percentage points  per annum from 2016 onwards, until we achieve a position of structural budget balance.  Assessment of compliance with this requirement will be based on application of the harmonised EU method for calculating the output gap.</p></reply>

The Central Bank assesses every application for authorisation in accordance with the relevant legislation.  Payday lenders are not permitted to operate in Ireland without appropriate authorisation from the Central Bank.   The Central Bank will continue to monitor this sector closely and to take action where necessary to protect borrowers  interests.</p><p>  The legislation under which moneylenders are supervised (the Consumer Credit Act 1995) does not provide for an interest rate cap.  The introduction of an interest rate ceiling may not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit for example, if the licensed moneylender chose instead to extend the duration of the loan.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would therefore have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit. There has been some public discussion about introducing an industry-wide cap on the rates moneylenders can charge. Lower interest rate ceilings could be ineffective and counterproductive in this regard and may result in excluding low income households that have repayment capacity, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders. The Central Bank would have some concerns therefore about the imposition of an industry-wide interest rate cap without there having been a full assessment of its impact on consumers.  The Central Bank has no statutory power to impose a market-wide cap on rates and examine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the rates are excessive.</p></reply>

The German Government asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date. </p><p>  A working group comprising of officials at my Department and staff of the National Treasury Management Agency have worked quickly to investigate ways to ensure that the benefit of this cooperation to Irish SMEs can be maximised.  In order to have the SBCI operational as soon as possible, the group are working in a number of areas to close agreements with Kreditanstalt f&uuml;r Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the European Investment Bank.  Both KfW and the European Investment Bank have indicated that they are willing to provide lower cost funding to SBCI for up to a 10-year term. Locking in funds at a lower cost for a 10-year period is both a major benefit and a risk mitigant for SMEs. To have locked in lower cost funding would be a major benefit in such circumstances   and this fact should provide considerable confidence to the SME sector as it increases the certainty of funding to that sector even in adverse financial market conditions.</p><p>  A key benefit of the SBCI will be its ability to facilitate loans with initial capital repayment breaks or the offering of loans with longer durations than are typically available currently. In such cases, SMEs would have greater capacity to make investments on the basis of improved cash flow matching, which makes growth more likely.  Additionally, the expanded pool of lending products could serve the needs of a wider cohort of SME customers than is presently served by the lending institutions.</p><p>  The establishment of the SBCI will provide in total over &euro;500m of additional credit for SME s and will be a great addition to the SME credit landscape in Ireland. This will promote greater competition in the SME lending sector, will drive economic growth and job creation in this key sector of our economy. The Government will be prioritising the passage of the required legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas and I expect the SBCI to be facilitating lending before the end of the year</p></reply>

The amounts shown in the table may not include additional yield of approximately &euro;2.5m tax that was secured following a specific programme of checks carried out nationally on close company surcharge compliance since the returns were filed.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Close Company Surcharge (&euro;m)</th><th>Professional Income Of Service  Companies Surcharge (&euro;m)</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>19.2</td><td>6.3</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>23.7</td><td>5.7</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>20.7</td><td>4.7</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>19.0</td><td>3.8</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>18.4</td><td>3.6</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>17.9</td><td>5.5</td></tr></table></p><p>Data for the tax year 2013 is not yet available as the bulk of tax returns for 2013 are not due until later this year. </p><p>It is tentatively estimated on the basis of tax returns for the year 2012 that the corporation tax loss associated with increasing the <i>de minimis</i>amount associated with the close company surcharge to &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000 could be of the order of &euro;2.4 million and &euro;5 million respectively. This cost does not include any cost associated with increasing the de minimus amount for the surcharge associated with professional income of service companies nor does it include any potential income tax loss associated with lower distributions as a result of the proposal. </p><p>Regarding Question No. 29789, it is tentatively estimated on the basis of tax returns for the year 2012 that the corporation tax loss associated with abolishing the surcharge associated with professional income of service companies could be of the order of &euro;5.5 million in a year. This cost does not include any potential income tax cost associated with the diversion of income into close companies that could arise as a result of the proposed abolition of the surcharge.</p><p>I would emphasise that the primary purpose of the close company surcharges is to counter attempts to avail of lower company taxation rates on personal income.  </p><p>In order to assist small companies with liquidity constraints and improve their cash flow position, these rules were relaxed modestly in Finance Act 2013 following the Budget announcement of a renewed focus on the SME sector.  The measures enabled companies to retain a higher amount of income for reinvestment without being liable to a surcharge.  </p><p>By way of example, at the current limits a company may keep up to &euro;100,000 on deposit at an interest rate of 2%, and retain the resulting interest income of &euro;2,000 for use in their business without suffering the surcharge.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current thresholds are now set at an appropriate level and I have no plans to amend them further.</p></reply>

Article 69.1 of the Customs Code states:</p><p>  Transport of the goods to the places where they are to be examined and samples are to be taken, and all the handling necessitated by such examination or taking of samples, shall be carried out by or under the responsibility of the declarant. The costs incurred shall be borne by the declarant.</p><p>  The above procedure was implemented by Revenue with effect from 1 March 2014 following an extensive consultative process with key stakeholders in Dublin Port. The implementation of the procedures  was also discussed with the Customs Consultative Committee, a group representing importers, exporters , the logistics sectors and Revenue.</p><p>  There are three freight compounds in Dublin Port. The compound operators are obliged under the terms of their Revenue approvals to provide the necessary examination facilities. The costs associated with the production of the goods are a matter between the freight compound operators and the importer and his agents. Revenue has no role in the setting of the charges involved.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have also advised that most imported goods are cleared through Customs without the need for a physical examination. The examination in the case in question was not a random selection, but was based on  Revenue's risk criteria.</p></reply>

For example, property owners can pay their LPT/HHC by way of voluntary deduction at source from salary or pension. This option, which is arranged by Revenue, is evenly divided over the amount of pay dates available in the person's annual payment cycle and carries no additional costs or transaction charges. </p><p>Alternatively, property owners can avail of monthly direct debits through their financial institutions or certain credit union accounts, or they can make regular weekly or monthly payments to one of the four approved payment service providers, which are An Post, Payzone, PayPoint and Omnivend. Details in regard to the four payment service providers, including information on their transaction fees are available on the Revenue website at . The transaction fees applied by the financial institutions and credit unions vary depending on the type of account held by the property owner.</p><p>In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, Revenue has confirmed to me that a member of the LPT team has already made telephone contact with the person in question to discuss the issues. The LPT team member outlined the different payment options to the person and also explained the qualifying criteria in respect of deferral and partial deferral of outstanding LPT/HHC liabilities. The person clearly indicated that he was not interested in deferring any part of his liabilities and opted to pay on a phased basis through one of the service providers. The LPT team member activated the person's preferred payment option for him and the issue is now resolved. </p></reply>

It appears to be affording real opportunities in the area of alternative non-bank finance for SMEs, particularly for those enterprises that have either been refused bank credit or who are less willing to formally apply for funding from traditional lenders.  Interestingly, however there is also innovative examples of SMEs using this type of funding to actually complement traditional bank debt financing.  Use of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer funding mechanisms have demonstrated substantial growth in the US and the UK in particular, albeit  targeted at minority and/or niche segments of the SME market.     </p><p>  However, crowdfunding is in its infancy and financial returns on capital will dictate its overall success. Comparable data is not yet readily available domestically, at EU level or internationally with which to analyse its impact to date, although moves are afoot at EU level to consider methods to address this data deficiency.  Lending directly to small growth companies via peer-to-peer exchanges has expanded recently. Irish exchanges have not yet matched international levels but there are a number of platforms in the Irish market.  As this new source of funding grows the issues of consumer protection and regulation are also coming more to the fore in many countries. The Government, through the State Bodies Group, chaired by my Department, are considering how best to support the development of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending in a manner that enhances SME access to finance and promotes increased entrepreneurship and business development. This will include looking at examples of good policy practice in other countries.  We will also be closely engaging in the EU level discussions on this issue, including in particular the subject of any future regulation of the sector.  While we continue to keep these matters under review we do consider that crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending has  a role to play as part of the range of bank and non-bank sources  of financing for SMEs in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-08a.418.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800063#WRF03600"><p>Since 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured. Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.  Prior to this, income tax relief for medical insurance premiums was provided at source, at the standard rate of income tax, on the entire premium amount regardless of cost. Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. </p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs was unsustainable. If the relief had remained unchanged and the trend was to continue, the cost would increase to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum by 2020.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the recent reform, the tax system is still supporting those who can afford private medical insurance to the tune of around &euro;400 million per annum. Effectively that means that some taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are continuing to provide financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited. The introduction of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that will qualify for tax relief achieves this recommendation.  </p><p>  It is unfair and unsustainable to allow unrestricted tax relief on private medical insurance premiums, particularly at a time when the general population has contributed so much to repairing the public finances. However, the new ceilings ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base, and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer, including state pensions.  </p><p>  An individual is not liable to pay USC where his or her total income does not exceed &euro;10,036. All State contributory and non-contributory pensions are exempt from the charge, and indeed are not included when calculating income levels for asessing whether individuals breach the threshold. Furthermore, individuals aged 70 and over, and medical card holders, benefit from a lower rate of USC (provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000). </p><p>  As a result of a review of the USC conducted by my Department in 2011, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  </p><p>  As part of the normal budgetary preparations, my officials will examine potential options for changes to the tax system for my consideration as part of the overall Budget package. However, it should be borne in mind that under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, until Ireland has reached its objective of a balanced budget in structural terms, we may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.</p></reply>

The objective of any scheme would be to ensure adequate availability of mortgage finance on affordable terms for new completions, particularly for 'First Time Buyers', as the economy recovers. In doing so I would aim to provide the certainty needed to support greater levels of investment in new housing, with the associated benefits for the construction sector and ultimately for the consumer.</p><p>  My Department is undertaking an economic impact analysis which will assess the impact such a scheme would have on the Irish housing market, taking into consideration time limits, targeting 'First Time Buyers' or owner occupiers and focussing on new housing. Initially, I envisage that any scheme would be limited in nature and targeted to support 'First Time Buyers'.  However, I will not pre-empt the outcome of the economic impact assessment from my Department which is currently underway. </p><p>   The purpose of this initiative will be to promote an increase in housing supply, only where needed. Any scheme I introduce will be designed to more effectively match demand with supply while also aiming to assist 'First Time Buyers'.</p><p>  The analysis will draw lessons from mortgage insurance initiatives undertaken in other countries and will include questions as to the appropriateness of a price cap as well as regional or geographic restrictions.  Once this analysis has been completed and presented to me I will consider  next steps.</p></reply>

This decision has been taken to give schools the flexibility to develop their Junior Cycle programme mindful of the educational needs of their own students and mindful of the principles, statements of learning and key skills as set out in the Framework.</p><p>  Education about active citizenship and the promotion of human rights issues are an integral component of the new Framework for Junior Cycle. For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will develop during their junior cycle, requires that all students will &quot;value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context&quot;.</p><p>  In addition, the 8 key skills which underpin the new Framework for Junior Cycle, include &quot;working with others&quot; whereby students should realise and experience how they can &quot;contribute to making the world a better place&quot;. As junior cycle students will experience the statements of learning and key skills, it is expected that education for active citizenship and education about human rights and responsibilities will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle.</p><p>  I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). This short course will be available to schools to implement, from this September, should they wish to do so as part of their Junior Cycle programme or they may continue to offer the current syllabus. Schools will choose from one or the other for the up-coming academic year 2014/2015. This programme is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.</p><p>  The new short course aims to inform, inspire, empower and enable young people to participate as active citizens in contemporary society at local, national and global levels based on an understanding of human rights and social responsibilities.</p><p>  As with Junior Cycle, education about active citizenship and human rights issues are also reflected at Senior Cycle. As part of transition year, students are afforded the opportunity to further interrogate some of the themes encountered in CSPE at Junior Cycle. This is facilitated by the availability of resources and materials that have been developed by a number of NGOs, including Amnesty International, for use by transition year pupils.</p><p>  I have also indicated my intention to introduce 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject. One of the objectives of the draft syllabus, which has been developed by the NCCA, is to develop 'a sense of care for others and a respect for and a valuing of diversity in all areas of human life within the parameters of human rights principles'. In addition, the draft syllabus is structured around four key areas. One of these areas is 'Active Citizenship'. The Politics and Society subject will be made available to schools once the NCCA has advised my Department on a number of outstanding issues.</p><p>  The developments in the Junior Cycle will provide our young people with the knowledge and skills to continue their studies in politics and society, if they so wish, when the new senior cycle specification becomes available.</p></reply>

There are a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country this school year, than there was the year before. While there has been a moratorium on recruitment across other sectors in the public service, this has not applied to teaching and shows the commitment this Government has to educating our future generations.</p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills key statistics for the 2013/14 academic year show that the number of children attending school has increased by 9,895 at primary level and 4,331 at post-primary (excluding PLCs). Despite these massive rises, pupil teacher ratios at primary school have dropped slightly from 16.4 to 16.3, while they have remained constant at second level at 13.9.</p><p>  The primary level statistics on class size data for the 2013/14 school year show the national average class size is 24.8 pupils. With over 21,000 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level.</p><p>  The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. It includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  In addition, a staffing appeals process is available to schools, including a new criterion for 2014/15 aimed at schools which make a significant contribution to absorbing demographic growth.</p></reply>

This is updated on a regular basis.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Five Year Construction Plan that I announced in March 2012 lists the individual school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan. The Plan priorities new school building projects as well as major extensions in areas where significant demographic need has been established, including areas in Meath, so that our school system is in a position to cater for increasing pupil numbers.</p><p>  Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department is committed to publishing a detailed annual programme in relation to individual major school projects commencing construction. In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects scheduled to commence construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published. In December 2012, details of 50 major school scheduled to proceed to construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan, were published. In November 2013, details of the 70 building projects scheduled to commence construction in 2014, the third year of the plan, were published. All three Plans are available on my Department's website.</p><p>  In addition, due to additional funding made available for the schools' building programme as part of the Government's &quot;Investing in Infrastructure and Jobs&quot; package, 28 school projects that were not contained in the Five Year Plan but had completed extensive architectural planning are now being progressed to tender and construction. Two schools in County Meath benefitted from this initiative.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that under the Prefab Replacement Initiative 2012, approval was given to 170 schools nationally to replace 458 prefab units with permanent accommodation. In excess of &euro;42 million was allocated for this initiative. In June 2013, the Department announced a further initiative to replace prefab units with permanent accommodation. A total of &euro;15 million has been allocated in 2013/14 for this purpose. Replacing prefabs is part of this Government's &euro;475 million education infrastructure plan for 2014. The list of schools approved under these prefab replacement schemes are available on the Department's website. 10 County Meath schools were awarded capital funding under this initiative.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced details of the schools, including those schools in County Meath that will receive Summer Works Scheme funding in 2014 in respect of applications submitted for Categories 1-6 i.e. Gas, Electrical, Mechanical, Toilet Facilities and Roof Works projects. In total, I have approved funding of more than &euro;70 million on this scheme to allow schools undertake improvement works during the summer. A list of the successful schools may be viewed on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The 2012 Act provides for fees to be determined in relation to fifteen different activities and services of QQI, although all providers will not wish to access all of these services. </p><p>  To date, fees have been determined for only a limited number of these services, including initial access to QQI programme validation and awards.  It is therefore not possible to give a definitive figure in relation to the cost of allowing all community groups a fee waiver for all of QQI's fees.  Furthermore, while in 2012 approximately 150 providers were categorised by QQI as 'community and voluntary', some, due to their size and related capacity issues, may choose not to re-engage with QQI when it formally establishes a quality assurance relationship with its providers, as required by the legislation.</p></reply>

Part of this process involved producing a Background Paper on the structures and systems of the current Irish Apprenticeship system and also examined the Apprentice models in a number of other countries including Germany, Finland and Norway.  </p><p>  Following the completion of the Background Paper, an Independent Apprenticeship Review Group completed a review of the Irish Apprenticeship System and submitted a report to my Department at the end of 2013.  The Group made a number of recommendations regarding a new structure for Apprenticeship in Ireland, which is envisaged as being relevant to a much wider group of enterprise sectors.  Recommendations were also made in relation to current apprenticeships. </p><p>  Following on from the Review and a subsequent consultation with key stakeholders, I published an Implementation Plan for the review's recommendations on the 30th June 2014.  As part of this plan a new Apprenticeship Council is to be appointed in the near future.  The Council will be enterprise led and have representatives from business, trade unions, further and higher education bodies. It will be hosted by SOLAS, the further education and training body with an independent chairperson.  </p><p>  The first job of work of the new Apprenticeship Council will be to make a call for proposals from industry for new apprenticeships.  It will then evaluate and submit proposals to my Department.  Alongside this work, the curricula for current apprenticeships will continue to be reviewed under existing structures.   Five trades (Electrical, Plumbing, Carpentry and Joinery, Metal Fabrication and Heavy Vehicle Mechanics) are currently being reviewed by SOLAS.  The implementation plan envisages accelerated arrangements for reviewing the remaining trades.</p><p>  I wish to see the outcome of this process to inform efforts to promote apprenticeship to learners, parents, employers and those involved in career guidance.  It should be noted that apprenticeship is currently a demand led system requiring the securing of employment as a means of entry.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Bill is to accelerate the national programme of revaluing every commercial and industrial property in the country which is being undertaken by the Valuation Office. In addition, the Bill proposes to amend valuation legislation in a number of areas including the appeal process.</p><p>  Currently, there are three avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination made under the provisions of the Valuation Act 2001.  However, before a determination is made, and therefore before any of the three avenues of redress are utilised, there is a right to make representations in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process there is a right of appeal to the Commissioner following the determination and publication of the valuation, which is known as the first appeal. This is followed by a right of appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal where the occupier is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision on appeal. Finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.  As a streamlining exercise, the Bill proposes to remove a step from the appeal process (i.e. the first appeal to the Commissioner)but in recognition of this, more time will be given to occupiers of property to make representations before the determination is made. It is proposed to extend the period within which representations can be made in relation to a proposed valuation from 28 to 40 days.</p><p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 specifies the persons who have a right to appeal a determination to the Commissioner and these include an occupier of the property under appeal; an occupier of relevant property situated in the same local authority area as the property under appeal; a rating authority in respect of any property in its area and a person, in respect of any property in relation to which he or she is an interest holder. The Bill proposes that the same parties will have a right to appeal a determination to the Valuation Tribunal.</p><p>  Under the current legislative provisions, valuations are determined by &quot;revision officers&quot; appointed by the Commissioner in the case of revision applications and by a &quot;valuation manager&quot; also appointed by the Commissioner where a rating authority area is being revalued. In the event of these valuations being appealed as a first appeal to the Commissioner, the Commissioner (as distinct from a revision officer or an appeal manager) is required under the Valuation Act 2001 to consider each appeal and allow or disallow the appeal as appropriate.</p><p>  Decisions on appeal have effect from the date of inclusion of the original valuation in the valuation list i.e. retrospection for rating applies to the date of the original determination of valuation which gave rise to the appeal.</p><p>  Since the second stage debate on the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012 was taken in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, officials of my Department and the Valuation Office have engaged in an extensive consultation process on various aspects of the Bill with a range of stakeholders. I would hope to see the Bill returning to the Seanad for Committee stage shortly after the summer recess.</p></reply>

Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  All rates collected within a local authority area are spent exclusively in delivering the public services which are required locally and help to create the environment in which businesses can prosper. Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation (ARV) they consider necessary in order to provide the required services. Rates are a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.  A system having regard to economic factors such as fluctuations in supply and demand, inherent in the property letting market on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base. Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate. </p><p>  The levying of rates on commercial property by reference to movements in the letting market rather than valuation would be a significant change and a departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates by reference to property values.  The introduction of such a system for rating purposes would not be suitable because supply and demand in the property market can vary significantly from year to year and within and between the various business sectors which would lead to an unstable and volatile valuation base. Therefore, I have no plans to change the method by which valuations are assessed for rating as such a radical move would represent a significant  departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates solely by reference to property values.</p><p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 provides for two key elements in the provision and maintenance of the valuation lists for rating - revision and revaluation. The revision process provides for the updating of valuation lists so that new properties can  be valued and added to the list, improved and extended properties can have their valuations updated and properties that have been demolished in whole or in part can have their valuations amended or struck out as appropriate. </p><p>  Under the current provisions of the Act, an owner/occupier of an individual business premises who has concerns about the valuation of their property or any part thereof, including its rateability or the method of calculation may apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.  A Revision Officer is then appointed, who may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances (MCC) has occurred since the property was last revised.  MCC is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances, which consist of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition, however, does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as road or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.</p><p>  The revaluation provisions in the Act provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as road or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property. The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system - distributing the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers. Following revaluation, there will generally be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability. In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the value of the property that they occupy. It is not the purpose of revaluation to increase the total amount of rates collected by local authorities. In fact, the relevant legislation (Valuation Act, 2001 and the Local Government Business (Improvements Districts) Act, 2006 provides that the commercial rates income of local authorities in the year following revaluation is capped.</p><p>  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas is conducted as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The first &euro;15,000 of annual earnings are free of PRD.  Nevertheless, all measures are subject to ongoing review and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of Pension Related Deduction on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received by public servants fell from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost</p><p>  Section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 also requires the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to conduct a review of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts. The review includes the measures introduced to provide for a Pension-related Deduction. I completed the statutory 2014 review on the 29 June 2014 and concluded that there is a need to continue to apply the Public Service Pension-related Deduction which applies to public service employees, including Local Authority staff.</p></reply>

Throughout this difficult period of fiscal adjustment, this Government has at all times endeavoured to spread the burden fairly throughout the economy in order to protect the most vulnerable in society.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that analysis of the impacts of tax measures and changes to some payments from the Department of Social Protection such as Family Income Supplement is published as part of the budgetary process over a wide distribution of income levels. </p><p>  This material is also supplemented by the regular analysis and commentary which is provided by the Department of Social Protection and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), both of which use the SWITCH model for estimating the effects of social welfare and tax rate changes on Irish households. The results from this analysis feed into budgetary considerations. </p><p>  These models are capable of analysing taxation and cash benefits only. The quantification of the benefits arising from public services more generally is more challenging. The Deputy can, however, be assured that decisions regarding the allocation of funds for public services undergo rigorous assessment and when making decisions on Budgetary matters, the Government is very much aware of issues in relation to equality, poverty and social exclusion.</p><p>  The Revised Estimates Volume has been expanded so that now each Department and Office also reports about key performance information relevant to their area of operation.  The purpose of this is to show what services are being purchased with public money and the impacts of these services. This facilitates consideration of the benefits being delivered to citizens and society in general from the Voted expenditure allocations. </p><p>  The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) was established in 2012 to enhance the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy making. This service is evidence of the commitment to ensure that sufficient analytical capacity is available to the Government to deliver a high standard of policy evaluation consistent with international best practice.</p></reply>

Under these statutory provisions, a 4-6 weeks consultation period will take place, through a formal Public Exhibition, which will be commenced before the end of 2014. There will be a number of days where members of the Design Team will be in attendance to deal directly with members of the public, all of which will be widely advertised. At that stage, the outline design of the proposed scheme will have been completed and will be displayed with full drawings to ascertain the views of the public and other stakeholders. Significant consultation is expected to take place with interested parties at this stage. All submissions made during the Exhibition period will be fully considered in the following months and any amendments arising from such submissions will be incorporated as appropriate in the detailed design stage of the Scheme.</p><p>  In advance of the formal Public Exhibition stage, the OPW will hold a 2nd public information day in Cork City Council Offices for elected councillors and the public on 29 July, 2014 which will provide a brief outline of the emerging preferred scheme to be brought forward later in the year.  This information day will be attended by members of the Design team to deal with queries from the public. It is also intended to keep all information on display for up to a further five days to facilitate those who might wish to comment at this stage. There will be a period afterwards for members of the public to submit their comments which can then be incorporated into documents for the Exhibition later in the year.</p><p>  The purpose of the information day is to provide an overview of the emerging scheme.  The full outline scheme documentation will not be available at that time as much work will still be required to complete all drawings and the Environmental Impact Statement. It is not proposed to extend the time period for this early information session as the main consultation period, at which more detailed information will be available, will commence within a few months thereafter.  Committing the Design Team to be available for 3 full days at this point, as requested, would not be warranted.</p></reply>

In the context of the sale of the National Lottery licence, I have considered it appropriate to re-appoint two of the Ministerial nominees to the An Post National Lottery Board; Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has been re-appointed twice and Mr. Oliver Wilkinson has been re-appointed once.  Consequently, recourse to advertising the positions publicly did not arise.  </p><p>The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 states that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (in consultation with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice and Equality) should appoint members of the Board of the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>The Public Appointments Service Board is meant to be representative of our client base.  The majority of the board are therefore civil or public servants, nominated by the relevant Minister.  There is also a union representative nominated by ICTU.  The two external members were appointed by me because of their expertise in strategic change and public service recruitment respectively. </p><p>In view of these statutory procedures for the appointment of members of the Boards, there is limited scope for me to use the Publicjobs.ie website.

The EU Commission is obliged to consult the Council on all aspects of the negotiations. This takes place in various formats and at different levels, including Council of Ministers, the Trade Policy Committee, informal technical meetings and bilateral and other meetings. I have participated in all the formal Council meetings so far at which TTIP has been discussed. My officials participate in the Trade Policy Committee and all other technical and official level meetings.</p><p>  As regards the impact of TTIP on Irish business and trade, my Department recently engaged Copenhagen Economics to examine the economic and other impacts of TTIP and related potential opportunities. The focus of this study is to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by TTIP. This work will help to inform our input to the European Union&rsquo;s negotiating position and to identify appropriate policy responses to be deployed to maximise the potential of this historic agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy.</p><p>  The Conference on TTIP that I hosted in Dublin Castle on 20 June, to which Oireachtas members from relevant Joint Committees were invited, heard some preliminary findings from Copenhagen Economics that indicate a comprehensive trade and investment deal between the EU and the US could lead to a 1.1% increase in Irish GDP. Other preliminary findings included benefits for Ireland including increased exports (2.7%) real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%). The Consultants are expected to finalise the report later this year, and this should provide a more comprehensive picture of the gains that could be realised for the country.</p><p>  As the negotiations advance, I will continue to look for an agreement that is comprehensive and balanced, and one that delivers real trade and economic potential for our economy.</p></reply>

Contracts are normally placed for a fixed period or for a defined piece of work.  If further support or development is required when a contract expires, this would normally be the subject of a new tender process.  For some IT support costs, such as proprietary software licenses, where open tendering is not always possible, my Department is engaged in an on-going process to ensure that such costs are kept to a minimum.  In general, my Department has engaged in an ongoing process of ICT support cost management, through the use of tendering, retiring older technologies, and insourcing supports where specialist skills become available in-house.  In the period between 2010 and 2013, this pro-active approach to IT support cost management has given rise to savings on externally delivered software supports, systems development, website supports, helpdesk supports and other IT consultancy which in 2013 amounted to over &euro;750,000 on the 2010 figure.  However, some of these savings are contingent on the continued availability of appropriate in-house resources, and on the level of new ICT development activity which will be significant in 2014.</p></reply>

S180/20/10/1597 of 17 April 2012) the restructuring of the existing micro enterprise support structures with a view to creating an enhanced national micro enterprise support model to be delivered through Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). The key elements of the Government decision were:<br /><br />Dissolve 35 County &amp;amp; City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), transfer their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI). <br /><br />Deliver enhanced service to the sector through the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) underpinned by a robust Service Level Agreement (SLA) between EI and the Local Authorities (LAs).<br /><br />Existing CEB staff to be given the option of redeploying to either Enterprise Ireland or the relevant Local Authority.<br /><br />Ring-fence CEB staff  to retain their expertise and enterprise culture for the new LEO.<br /><br />Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to retain responsibility for enterprise policy and budgets.<br /><br />Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to draft any legislation necessary to achieve these objectives.</td></tr><tr><td>Directive 2011/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions (Recast) </td><td>This RIA was prepared by my Department in August, 2012.  The purpose of the Recast Directive is to combat late payment in commercial transactions, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, thereby fostering the competitiveness of undertakings and, in particular, of SMEs. <br /><br /><br />Previously the rules on late payments were under Directive 2000/35 and this new legislation repeals and modernises these old rules.<br /><br /><br />This Directive lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.<br /><br />This Directive came into effect across the EU on 16th March 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill 2012 </td><td>This RIA was prepared by my Department in April, 2012.  The objective of this legislation is to establish a Microenterprise Loan Fund and to provide for Social Finance Foundation to manage and control the Microenterprise Loan Fund on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. It empowers the Minister to pay monies provided by the Oireachtas into the fund and to accept gifts of moneys for allocation to the Fund. <br /><br /><br />The objective of the fund is to provide loans to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, thereby facilitating job creation and retention across the economy in all microenterprises with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional<br /><br />risk criteria applied by banks.<br /><br /><br />The Microenterprise Loan Fund is not intended to replace any current bank.</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Guarantee Bill 2012</td><td>This RIA was carried out in October, 2011.  The ultimate objective of this regulatory proposal is to empower the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to establish a targeted Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.<br /><br /><br />The legislation will empower the Minister to give a loan guarantee, designate a lending institution as a participating lending institution, set eligibility criteria for borrowers in such lending institutions, set loan conditions, set out requirements in respect of liability of the Minister regarding payment of<br /><br />guarantees, to require adequate monitoring arrangements and evaluation, to review and revoke the scheme and to assign a contractor to oversee the operation of the Scheme.<br /><br /><br />The objective of the Scheme is to provide a Government guarantee to the lender of 75 per cent on eligible individual loans to viable businesses, which is paid to the lender on the unrecovered outstanding balance on a loan in the event of an SME defaulting on the loan repayments. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage additional lending to SMEs, not to substitute for conventional lending. It is not a grant, nor is it a support for ailing businesses. The Scheme is intended to address specific market failures that prevent bank lending to some commercially viable businesses by providing a level of guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms.  All decision making at the level of the individual loan will be fully devolved to the participating lenders.</td></tr><tr><td>Workplace Relations Bill 2014</td><td>To explore the various policy options regarding the introduction of legislation to consolidate the existing employment and equality dispute resolution and compliance and enforcement bodies. The Draft Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill outlines proposals which will deliver a root-and-branch reform of the State's existing employment rights and industrial relations structures.  The current complex structure involving five bodies will be replaced with a new reformed two-tier system compromising two bodies (the Workplace Relations Commission and an expanded Labour Court), supported by a single shared-services administration. </td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, if a series of deductions (or payments) are to be made in respect of a particular act or omission or in respect of the provision of goods and services, the first deduction (or payment) in the series must be made within the 6 month period.</p><p>In addition, any deduction (or payment to the employer) arising from any act or omission of an employee, must satisfy the following conditions:</p><p>-  the employee must be given particulars in writing of the act or omission and the amount of the deduction (or payment) at least one week before the deduction (or payment) is made,</p><p>-  if the deduction (or payment) is in respect of compensation for loss or damage sustained by the employer as a result of an act or omission of the employee, the amount of the deduction should not exceed the amount of the loss or the cost of the damage.</p><p>The Payment of Wages Act provides that, where an employee considers that there may have been a contravention of the Act, the employee may submit a complaint to a Rights Commissioner within 6 months of the date of the alleged contravention (this may be extended to 12 months where a Rights Commissioner considers that there were exceptional circumstances for the delay in submitting the claim).

This 15 day prompt payment rule, introduced by Government on a voluntary basis, was extended to the wider Public Sector in March, 2011.</p><p>  Departments are required to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target.  The latest set of composite figures available are for Quarter 1 2014 and show that 90% of Government payments, valued at &euro;466m, were paid to suppliers within 15 days. </p><p>  As part of this new extended arrangement, parent Departments are required to publish on their respective websites quarterly composite reports covering those bodies under their aegis.  These comprehensive reporting arrangements ensure that Ministers can monitor the performance of the bodies under their aegis and address any issue with those bodies who are not meeting obligations in respect of prompt payments.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs contains further commitments by Government in the area of late payments.  These include the introduction of a Prompt Payment Code of Conduct for business, currently being developed by business representative bodies in Ireland with the support of my Department and a national information campaign to raise awareness of the measures introduced both nationally and at EU level to combat late payments. These initiatives, together with the late payment legislation, demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s continuing drive and commitment to encourage a prompt payment culture in Ireland.</p></reply>

This Round covered extensive technical discussion on a broad range of issues including regulatory issues, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, government procurement, intellectual property rights, electronic commerce and telecommunications, environment, labour, small and medium-sized enterprises, and energy and raw materials. Some discussion has already started on the text of an agreement in relation to helping SMEs, technical barriers to trade and on competition.  The next round is due to take place during the week beginning 14 July, 2014.</p><p>Negotiations on TTIP can be summarised as covering three broad areas:</p><p>The first is <b>market access</b>, for goods, services, and public procurement.  The first tariff offers, that is, the immediate or phased elimination of import tariffs on an extensive list of goods, were exchanged earlier this year, and I expect that, over the next few weeks there will be further work and negotiations to extend the range of tariff free trade that can take place once TTIP comes into effect. On services, I understand that the US tabled its first offer last week, and Member States will meet shortly to discuss what has been proposed by the U.S. The Commission expects that the EU&rsquo;s first offer on services will be ready soon. Naturally there is an important level of confidentiality about the detail of both sides&rsquo; negotiating position, but I am hopeful that the greatest level of market access can be achieved for our services exporters and for those looking to penetrate the very large U.S. public procurement market.</p><p>The second area covered by the talks is <b>&ldquo;rules&rdquo;</b>, on trade facilitation (EU and US customs systems), state-owned enterprises (these should operate on commercial lines), on raw materials and energy (EU is looking for access to US oil/gas exports that are currently restricted), and on labour and the environment issues (no weakening of standards/protections). Coming to agreement on these will also serve to set the standards for other Free Trade Agreements with trading partners, reduce the complexity for small companies to comply with many standards and market regulations, and regulate markets in an open and transparent manner.</p><p>The third most difficult and complex, but most important aspect of the negotiations, is <b>reducing regulatory burdens, </b>which involve a multiplicity of sectoral regulations.  In particular, areas of regulation such as financial services, environment, and health and public safety are important here. In these areas there are legitimate but in many cases unfounded concerns about a possible lowering of regulatory standards.  In fact, both the EU and the US are equally committed to retaining the high standards that serve to protect consumers. The objective in TTIP is to address differences in standards between our two economies while at all times maintaining the high levels of health, safety, environmental and other protection that is reflected in EU legislation.</p><p>Progress in respect of regulation, through harmonisation, mutual recognition or convergence, is the most important area. Studies by the Commission show that changes here will yield the most net gains under the Agreement. The Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment suggests that between two thirds and four fifths of the gains from a future agreement would come from cutting red tape and having more coordination between regulators. It is important to see this as a two part issue:  the process of how regulation is enacted, and the sector specific solutions being negotiated.  How regulations are made, needs to be more transparent, with regulators deepening relationships with each other in order to address emerging issues together, such as setting standards for new technologies. Regulators are also discussing how to reduce the cost of meeting existing standards without affecting the levels of protection afforded by them. </p><p>In addition, real progress on issues like car safety standards, ending double inspections at pharmaceutical and medical device plants, should, over time, reduce costs for business, regulators and consumers. It is important to note that while regulatory aspects are one of the main elements of the TTIP negotiations, there is nothing in the negotiations that should prevent or undermine the rights of both sides to regulate, and the level of regulatory protection on both sides, be it environment, food, consumer safety, will not be lessened. </p><p>As regards investment protection, the European Commission launched a public consultation last March on the investment protection provisions of a future Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.  All stakeholders have had the opportunity to respond to this consultation, so that specific interests and concerns on investor protection and settlement of related disputes could be well understood by the European Commission, and used to better define the EU&rsquo;s approach to investor protection in the TTIP negotiations.  The public consultation closed on 6 July, and I expect that the EU Commission will need a few weeks to fully analyse the contributions.</p><p>Further information on the negotiations, including background documents, are available on the European Commission&rsquo;s TTIP website]  </p><p>My Department recently engaged international expertise to examine the economic and other impacts TTIP and related potential opportunities. The focus of this study will be to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by the TTIP. This work will help to inform our input to the European Union&rsquo;s negotiating position and to identify appropriate policy responses to be deployed to maximise the potential of this historic agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy.</p><p>I hosted a Conference in Dublin Castle on the 20<sup>th</sup>June to look at the opportunities for Ireland from the TTIP and to bring together at political and senior executive level, Oireachtas members, representatives of various economic interests (including farmers and trade unions), Government Departments, Agencies and Regulators, in order to explore opportunities that lie ahead for Ireland. </p><p>At this stage it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the impact of TTIP on our economy. However, initial assessments suggest that Ireland will benefit to a greater extent than the EU. Preliminary estimates point to a possible increase of 1.1% in GDP compared with a .5% GDP increase for the EU as a whole. This could give rise to an increase of 8,000 jobs over the implementation period of the Partnership. </p><p>As the negotiations advance, I will continue to look for an agreement that is comprehensive and balanced and one that delivers real trade and economic potential for our economy. In this context I recognise the need to minimise the impact of trade liberalisation and market opening on sensitive areas of the economy and will continue to express our concerns that any agreement respects our broad trade, economic and social interests and especially those of the Agriculture sector. </p><p>As regards the Trade in Services Agreement, this is an ambitious multi-country set of negotiations for an agreement on trade in services between members of the World Trade Organisation that are some of the largest importers and exporters of services. There are currently 22 countries participating in the negotiations with the EU counting as one participant. These are Australia, Canada, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and the USA. </p><p>Since the EU Council&rsquo;s Decision in March, 2013 during the Irish Presidency that gave the formal green light for the EU to participate in these talks, eight rounds of negotiations have taken place, the eighth round having just concluded in the last week of June in Geneva. </p><p>Ireland fully supports the EU&rsquo;s approach in these negotiations. The exports of services are very important to the Irish economy. Last year the value of Ireland&rsquo;s exports of services reached a new record of almost &euro;95 billion; and with services imports worth &euro;89 billion; Ireland had a trade surplus of &euro;6 billion; for trade in services in 2013. An ambitious outcome in the Trade in Services Agreement negotiations is therefore very important for our economy.  While the negotiations are currently outside of the General Agreement for Trade in Services (GATS), it is intended that the Agreement will eventually come within the scope of the GATS, so that all WTO member countries can participate and benefit.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by almost 90 private transport operators. At the end of May this year there were over 790,000 customers in receipt of free travel.</p><p>  Funding for the free travel scheme was capped by the previous Government as outlined in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014. To implement this funding cap during a time in which passenger numbers have been increasing each year the Department has had to impose a freeze on the amounts paid to companies and a complete restriction on the admittance of new companies or routes to the scheme. This has included new companies taking over previously extant routes. </p><p>  Given the increasing number of recipients, the funding pressures and the changes to the transport system such as the privatisation of some routes, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I established a working group with representatives from the two Departments, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority to review the free travel scheme. The purpose of this review is to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme. </p><p>  I appreciate the importance of the scheme and the value it provides to the hundreds of thousands of mostly elderly people who use it.  I have no plans to take passes away from pensioners nor to limit the use of passes for older persons on any of the bus routes which are being considered for privatisation.  It is important, however, to ensure that the scheme, which has been in operation for almost fifty years, can continue to operate in an efficient and sustainable way into the future.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is not possible to discriminate between persons born outside this jurisdiction, either by exempting or targeting persons born in specific jurisdictions. </p><p>  There are two international conventions which govern the authentication of documents &ndash; The Hague Convention, 1961 which relates to the use of an apostille and the Brussels Convention, 1987 between member states of the EU. Generally, birth certificates issued by authorities outside this jurisdiction must bear an apostille or, in the case of a country that is not a signatory of the Hague Convention 1961, be attested by the relevant Embassy. </p><p>  All countries of the European Union are signatories of the Hague Convention. </p><p>  Certificates issued in a country which has signed and ratified the Brussels Convention are not required to bear an apostille when produced in another country which has ratified the convention. The countries which have signed and ratified the Brussels Convention are - Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland and Italy. The United Kingdom has signed, but not ratified, the Brussels Convention and certificates issued in that jurisdiction are dealt with under the Hague Convention and are therefore required to bear an apostille. </p><p>  The birth records of persons born in this jurisdiction must also be fully checked before a marriage registration form can be issued. However, there is no requirement for these records to be authenticated further, as the registrar taking the notice of intention to marry is in a position to do this.</p></reply>

The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has an RSS allocation of 437 participants and 21 supervisors.  I do not propose allocating additional places to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s given its own capacity to locate the existing level of placements to meet identified community needs across the Gaeltacht area.  The Deputies should also note that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is also engaged by the Department of Social Protection to deliver T&uacute;s and community employment in Gaeltacht areas and has considerable resources at its disposal to manage the situation identified with local community organisations.

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects. </p><p>  Despite pressure on the social protection budget, the Government allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, increasing the total allocation to &euro;37 million. The additional &euro;2 million was used to extend the school meals local projects scheme to some 100 additional DEIS and special schools benefiting over 9,700 children.  </p><p>  The school meals scheme is in place to provide support to disadvantaged children and priority is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS). Analysis undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills shows that there are currently 850 DEIS schools of which 715 are participating in the school meals programme. Applications from DEIS schools not currently participating in the scheme will continue to be accepted by the Department. </p><p>  Budget 2014 announced the provision of breakfast clubs to support school going children in disadvantaged areas.  Correspondence has issued to 12 DEIS schools currently participating in the scheme which have applied for funding towards a breakfast club for the forthcoming academic year. </p><p>  The Department has not examined or conducted a feasibility study to extend the school meals programme to every school. Any further extension of the scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed. It provides employers with two levels of payment: &euro;7,500 over two years where a jobseeker who is 12-24 months on the live register is recruited and &euro;10,000 for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 24 months. The subsidy is paid in monthly instalments over a two year period provided the employment is maintained. </p><p>  To qualify as an eligible employee for the &euro;7,500 incentive, a jobseeker must be at least 12 months (312 days) on the Live Register in the previous 18 months. To qualify as an eligible employee for the higher incentive of &euro;10,000, a jobseeker must be at least 24 months (624 days) on the Live Register in the previous 30 months. Periods spend on an internship under JobBridge are counted towards eligibility and interns can be supported directly from JobBridge once the eligibility criteria are satisfied. </p><p>  A person on a one parent family payment is not considered eligible given the focus of JobsPlus on recruitment from those longer term unemployed and receiving a jobseekers payment. The Department is currently finalising a review of the initial phase of implementing JobsPlus. The review will consider eligibility criteria currently in place and if these continue to be appropriate to meet the objectives set for JobsPlus.  The Deputy will appreciate that any broadening of eligibility will have cost implications and these will require consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget. </p><p>  Since its launch in July 2013 to the end of May 2014, JobsPlus has supported 2,385 jobseekers in full-time employment with 1,811 employers nationally. Around 60% of jobseekers being supported had been on the Live Register for over 24 months at the time of recruitment. </p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by almost 90 private transport operators. There are currently over 780,000 people in receipt of free travel. </p><p>  Funding for the free travel scheme was capped by the previous Government as outlined in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014. To implement this funding cap during a time in which passenger numbers have been increasing each year the Department has had to impose a freeze on the amounts paid to companies and a complete restriction on the admittance of new companies or routes to the scheme. This has included new companies taking over previously extant routes. </p><p>  Given the increasing number of recipients and the funding pressures, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I established a working group with representatives from the two Departments, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority to review the free travel scheme. The purpose of this review is to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme. </p><p>  I appreciate the importance of the scheme to customers, particularly pensioners, and am aware of the closure of Lough Swilly Bus Company and the implications for travel pass holders in that area.  Department officials have had discussions with the National Transport Authority on this and other matters of concern to the scheme in the context of the review of the scheme.  The work of this group is expected to conclude shortly.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  There is no specific restriction on landlords renting to family members provided all of the qualifying criteria for the rent supplement scheme have been met. Under the rules governing entitlement to rent supplement, the Department must establish that the applicant is a bona fide tenant. In determining whether the applicant is a bona fide tenant the Department will generally require documentary evidence including: details of the lease agreement; proof of ownership of the property; documentation that the tenancy has been registered with the PRTB; and documentation detailing payments made to the landlord.</p><p>  The Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities, in conjunction with voluntary organisations, so that families in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  The public awareness campaign &ldquo;Preventing Families from becoming Homeless in the Dublin Region&rdquo; was launched on 17th June 2014 to advertise this protocol. As of 4th   July 2014, 20 cases have been referred to the Department of which 6 rent supplement recipients were provided with increased rental payments.  The remaining 14 cases are being processed in line with the terms of the protocol.    </p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that Department officials have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.</p></reply>

Details of these Bills are set out in the attached table.</p><p>Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) are undertaken by the Department of Social Protection in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by the Department of the Taoiseach relating to significant legislative, policy and other changes.  </p><p>A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not ordinarily undertaken on the package of tax, welfare and other measures announced in the annual Budget Day Statements.  As most of the Social Welfare Bills which have been published since March 2011 have provided for the implementation of various budgetary measures, RIAs have not been considered necessary in relation to these measures.  Social Welfare Bills also provide for a range of other miscellaneous and technical amendments to the social welfare code and these types of amendment are not considered amenable to the undertaking of an RIA.</p><p>Where significant non-budgetary changes have been provided for in the Bills which I have published, Regulatory Impact Analyses have been undertaken.  Two such RIAs have been published since March 2011.  One of these RIAs relates to amendments to the funding standard applying to defined benefit pension schemes, which were provided for in Part 3 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012.  This RIA is available at  .</p><p>The other RIA relates to the measures to provide for the transposition of certain aspects of Directive 2010/41/EU on the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, in so far as they relate to ensuring that the spouse or civil partner of a self-employed worker can benefit from social protection in accordance with national law. The amendments necessary to transpose these provisions are contained in section 19 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014 (as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann).  This RIA is available at .</p><p>In addition, Part 4 of the Social Welfare and Pension (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 implemented the recommendations of the Critical Review of the Pension Board.  This review, which involved a public consultation process, was carried out under the Public Service Reform plan.  This review is available at .</p><p>Part 3 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for changes in the manner in which the resources of a defined benefit pension scheme are distributed on the wind up of a pension scheme. On the publication of this Bill, the Department of Social Protection also published a report by Mercer on the changes to occupational pensions.  This report undertook a detailed modelling exercise of different approaches to the changes to the order of priority given to the disbursement of assets when a defined benefit pension scheme winds up.   This is available at .  </p><p>The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2012 provided for an extension of the list of bodies authorised to solemnise marriages.  As these changes were of a minor nature, an RIA was not considered necessary in the case of this Act. </p><p><b><i>Bills Initiated by Minister for Social Protection since March 2011</i></b><table><tr><th>Title of Bill</th><th>Status</th><th>RIA Undertaken</th></tr><tr><td>Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011</td><td>Enacted 29th June 2011</td><td>Not considered necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Social Welfare Act 2011</td><td>Enacted 19th December 2011</td><td>Not considered necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012</td><td>Enacted 1st May 2012</td><td>RIA undertaken on Part 3 of Act</td></tr><tr><td>Social Welfare Act 2012</td><td>Enacted 21st December 2012</td><td>Not considered necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2012</td><td>Enacted 26th December 2012</td><td>Not considered necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013</td><td>Enacted 28th June 2013</td><td>Not considered necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013</td><td>Enacted 9th November 2013</td><td>Not considered necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill 2013</td><td>Enacted 25th December 2013 </td><td>Not considered necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014</td><td>Published on 28th May 2014 and currently before the Oireachtas</td><td>RIA undertaken on section 19 of Bill</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Its remit does not extend to the supervision of the trust deed and rules of a pension scheme. It is not within the remit of the Pensions Authority to ensure that the trustees of a pension scheme carry out the duties imposed on them by law other than the duties set out for the trustees in the Pensions Act.</p><p>  It should be noted that the benefits of a pension can be restructured under the provisions of the Pensions Act or can be restructured under the rules of the scheme and without reference to any provisions or requirements of the Pensions Act.   If the benefits of a scheme are restructured without reference to the provisions in the Pensions Act then any such adjustment of scheme benefits would not come within the remit of the Pensions Authority.</p><p>  The matters raised by the complainant have been considered at the highest level both within the Pensions Authority and within the Department and unfortunately the outcome has not been to the satisfaction of the complainant.  The Pensions Authority does not have the power to enforce the statutory provisions which established the scheme and the complainant will have to seek relief elsewhere.</p><p>  If it is considered that a pension is not being paid in accordance with the rules of a pension scheme, the person concerned can invoke the dispute resolution procedures which the scheme is obliged to operate and if they are still dissatisfied, they can bring the complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman.   You may also wish to note that the Pensions Authority came under the remit of the Ombudsman (not the Pensions Ombudsman), who deals with customers who feel they may have been unfairly treated by public bodies.  </p></reply>

Should the labour market situation of young people improve during this period the review will examine opportunities to broaden and deepen the level of supports offered in respect of those young people who continue to be unemployed.</p><p>  The EU Council Recommendation on the Guarantee recommends that member states &ldquo;should &ldquo;ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education&rdquo;.</p><p>  The age coverage for the implementation of the Guarantee here is in line with the EU Recommendation, and there are accordingly no plans to increase the age of eligibility for the youth guarantee in Ireland.</p></reply>

The biggest single block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2014 is expenditure on pensions<b></b>which<b></b>will amount to &euro;6.5 billion, or 33% of overall expenditure. Because of demographic change the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  In 2013, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million for the increasing number of pensioners. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty.  </p><p>To allow the Department to protect core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package. </p><p>In Budget 2014, I regretfully had to make the decision to abolish the telephone allowance, which was &euro;9.50 per month, for all recipients. I am not in a position to reverse this decision or provide an alternative payment.</p><p>The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. These are valuable supports for recipients. The Department will spend &euro;230 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 410,000 customers.</p><p>The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities. The living alone allowance was maintained at &euro;7.70 per week.    </p><p>The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes. The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million. There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014. </p></reply>

It is also available to people who are less than 66 years of age, living alone and in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension, incapacity supplement or blind pension.</p><p>  The most recent Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data from 2012 shows that the various poverty indicators demonstrate no significant difference in outcomes for those over 65 living alone, and those over 65 who live with another adult. The &ldquo;at risk of poverty rate&rdquo; for households aged over 65 with one adult was 12.9%. For households with two adults it was 13%. Similarly, the consistent poverty rate for households aged over 65 with one adult was 3.1% and for two adults it was 2.9%.</p><p>  Each &euro;1 increase in the living alone allowance would cost &euro;9.4milllion in a full year.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-08a.995.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800072#WRP00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 429 to 431, inclusive, together. </p><p>  The one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction in 1997.  The number of OFP recipients stood at 74,426 in May, 2014, and an estimated &euro;863 million is expected to be spent on the scheme during 2013.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, contains provisions to reduce, on a phased basis, the income disregard of the OFP scheme. The income disregard was reduced from &euro;110 per week to its current limit of &euro;90 per week in January, 2014. It will be further reduced from &euro;90 per week to &euro;75 per week in January 2015 and to &euro;60 per week in January 2016. There are no plans to reverse these reductions and any change to these arrangements would require substitute savings and would have to be considered in a budgetary context. </p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, also contains provisions to reduce, on a phased basis, the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.</p><p>  On 3 July, 2014, approximately 5,140 customers saw their entitlement to the OFP payment cease as a result of their youngest child reaching the maximum age threshold of the OFP scheme.</p><p>  Approximately 3,600 of the affected OFP customers are expected to have applied for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment.  Of these customers, approximately 70% are not working and, as such, will not suffer any reduction in their new income support payment as the JA payment pays the same personal and qualified child rates as the OFP payment. Any of these customers with a child under 14 years of age will be subject to the JA transitional arrangement, which exempts these individuals from having to be genuinely seeking and available for full time employment. This exemption is in recognition of lone parents caring responsibilities and will reduce their requirement for childcare. </p><p>  Approximately 850 of the affected OFP customers were also claiming the family income supplement (FIS) by virtue of being in employment for 19 or more hours per week.  These customers have had their FIS payment automatically adjusted to compensate for some 60% of the loss of their OFP payment.</p><p>It is expected that from now until the end of June 2015 a further 4,000 OFP recipients will lose entitlement to the OFP payment as a result of the reductions in the OFP age threshold which came into effect on 3 July. Monthly figures for the approximate number of these customers, who are expected to transition from the OFP payment to the JA payment over the coming twelve months, are unavailable as the exact number of individuals moving to the JA scheme will depend on their individual circumstances and the number of individuals who may be eligible to apply for the FIS payment.</p><p>  Childcare policy, and the delivery of childcare services, is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA).  However, as part of a package of measures in Budget 2013, I, along with then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Frances Fitzgerald, announced an after-school child care (ASCC) initiative between our two Departments.  The purpose of the ASCC scheme, which was rolled out nationally in 2013, is to help to offset some of the after-school child care costs that are associated with availing of an employment opportunity in a bid to encourage more individuals to take up employment.  The scheme provides 800 subsidised after-school childcare places and is open to both jobseekers and OFP recipients.</p><p>  In Budget 2014, the re-focusing of some of the original ASCC scheme budget enabled Minister Fitzgerald and I to introduce the community employment (CE) childcare programme.  This scheme was implemented in January, 2014, and provides some 1,800 subsidised childcare places to CE participants.</p><p>  These two schemes build on the existing supports provided for, and implemented by, the D/CYA in the childcare sector, through which childcare is provided to approximately 35,000 children of low-income parents at reduced rates.</p></reply>

Payment of his pension is abated pending the termination of his temporary contract. </p><p>  The Department held a competition to recruit a new Chief Medical officer in late 2013, however, no candidate was deemed suitable at interview.   The decision to re-employ the Chief Medical Advisor was taken due to his specific skills and his involvement in the policy reform of the illness related schemes, the difficulty and long lead-in time for replacing his skills, and the critical importance of ensuring continuity and a high level of service to customers of the Department.</p><p>  As an exception to the current moratorium on recruitment, my department has limited sanction to recruit temporary clerical officers to cover critical staff absences and to assist with the roll-out of the new Public Service Card.  One temporary staff member is a retired civil servant.  They are on a pay scale of &euro;19,814 to &euro;31,965 and were recruited on foot of open competitions run by the Public Appointments Service.  Abatement of pension applies, if applicable, for the duration of these temporary contracts.</p><p>  Two retired public servants were re-hired by the Pensions Authority in 2011; one at Higher Executive Officer level and one at Assistant Principal Officer level. Both individuals were recruited directly by the Pensions Authority, on three year fixed-term temporary contracts (due to cease by 31 December 2014), and were placed on the standard scales relating to their respective posts. Please note, the Authority is not Exchequer funded.</p><p>The Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board had one former staff member hired on a contract for service basis.  The contract followed a procurement process. The amount paid was &euro;3,714.80 and the payments relates to the period Oct-Dec 2013.</p></reply>

With regard to the capital budget for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, I wish to reiterate that, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas. In that context, I wish to again acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic agency for the Gaeltacht.   </p><p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's end of year statement for 2013 indicated that the rate of job losses in its client companies had reached a record low. This was very welcome news indeed. However, while the level of job losses has stabilised, I am very cognisant of the ongoing difficult challenge in creating a sufficient number of new jobs to maintain, and indeed increase, employment levels in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>  I met recently with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and discussed its strategic proposal to increase its capital budget over time from the present level of &euro;5.687m to &euro;12m per annum. I am very aware and supportive of the case advanced by the organisation that such an increase in funding would enable it to create an additional 300 jobs per annum. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, it was announced as part of Budget 2014 that comprehensive reviews of both current and capital expenditure would be undertaken by all Government Departments in this jurisdiction during 2014. These reviews underpin the Government's multi-annual budgetary framework and are conducted periodically to re-set Departmental expenditure ceilings in line with emerging Government priorities. These reviews are currently ongoing and will be considered by Government later this year with a view to underpinning expenditure ceilings for 2015 and beyond, as well as clarifying policy options and informing prioritisation decisions arising from the expenditure ceilings. Clearly, the capital allocation for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for 2015 will be informed by the outcome of those reviews and within the framework of the Budgetary and Estimates processes later in the year.</p><p>  In relation to Foras na Gaeilge, the Deputy will also be aware that Foras na Gaeilge is one of the agencies of An Foras Teanga, the North South Language Body, and its budget must accordingly be approved by the North South Ministerial Council. Foras na Gaeilge is co-financed on the basis of 75% from my Department and 25% from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland. In addition, my Department provides certain additional ringfenced funding for Foras na Gaeilge in relation to Cl&aacute;r na Leabhar Gaeilge and Colmcille.</p><p>  While my Department will continue to provide funding for An Foras Teanga, subject to the normal budgetary processes, I should point out that the Public Expenditure/Finance Departments in both jurisdictions have already agreed that minimum efficiency savings of 4% must be achieved by all North South Implementation Bodies in 2015. </p></reply>

Following on from the previous Culture Programme and MEDIA programmes, Creative Europe, with a budget of &euro;1.46 billion (9% higher than its predecessors), will support:   <blockquote>- Culture sector initiatives, such as those promoting cross-border cooperation, platforms, networking and literary translation;<br /><br />- Audiovisual sector initiatives, such as those promoting the development, distribution or access to audiovisual works; and<br /><br />- A cross-sectoral strand, including a financial guarantee facility and transnational policy cooperation.</blockquote>It is not possible to estimate how much any country will receive from the <i>Creative Europe</i>programme. Periodically, there are calls for proposals from the European Commission seeking applications for support under the programme. The applications are then assessed by an independent body, the Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture (EACEA). The decisions on what support is provided are based on the merits of the applications and there is no quota or specific amount allocated to each country.

A pilot programme for this initiative in Westport, Youghal and Listowel operated through 2013 and will conclude in 2014.   My primary objective with this pilot is to ensure that the participating towns have access to, and an understanding of, appropriate guidance to assist them in best conserving their heritage assets and, in so doing, underpin the sustainability of their community and local economy.  It is my hope that meeting these goals will also, by extension, significantly enhance the visitor experience in these towns, thus helping to maximise the potential positive contribution of tourism to each of these towns and their respective hinterlands.</p><p>Each participating town has set up a local Historic Towns Initiative working group consisting of representatives of local government, businesses, community groups and other stakeholders. The local groups are responsible for drawing up a vision for their town with specific objectives supported by a clear action plan.  Funding was allocated by my Department to the towns for projects in 2013 and 2014 and this is set out in the table below. Additional support was provided to the initiative by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the relevant local authorities.  Projects funded under the initiative include public realm enhancement works, heritage interpretation works and conservation works to heritage structures.   </p><p>On conclusion of the pilot programme later this year, I will consider the future expansion of the initiative to other historic towns, along with participating criteria for historic towns.  However, any enlargement of the initiative will, as previously advised to the Deputy, be subject to the availability of funding in the context of the many competing priorities for the conservation, preservation and presentation of the State&rsquo;s heritage.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Allocation to Historic Towns Initiative</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;240,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;120,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a long term, future proofed infrastructure build with next generation backhaul infrastructure (likely to be primarily fibre based) as the key component underpinning whatever access technology delivers the service (fixed or wireless). This infrastructure build will extend to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website, </p><p>Currently, a total of 108 areas in County Cork have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. </p><p>I have recently launched a stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the State-led intervention. This consultation, among other things, seeks views on the proposed criteria to be used in finalising those locations which require a State intervention. The outcome of this consultation will enable finalisation of the mapping exercise, which I expect will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention. As part of this process consideration will be given to appropriate measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services. My Department has already received a detailed submission from residents and business in the Courtbrack area of County Cork and this will be considered in the context of the mapping exercise and strategy development generally. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy once finalised. </p><p>This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The size of rod caught salmon reported in the national tagging and logbook scheme was used to determine the percentage of the rod catch greater than 4kg (as representative of MSW fish). The proportion of MSW salmon used in the calculation of conservation limit was raised from 7.5% to 38% for the Suir in 2012. On the basis of a higher proportion of multi sea winter salmon, the conservation limit for the Suir decreased from 16,464 salmon in 2011 to 14,048 in 2012. The calculation of CL for individual rivers will not be examined again for a five year period.</p><p>  The Stillwaters Consultancy letter states that a new survey in the closed season to bolster the catch figures of anglers and snap net fishermen from the Nore to give a picture of the proportions of salmon both 1SW and MSW destined for each river system is now vital.</p><p>  As set out above, the proportions of 1SW and MSW salmon were revised for the Barrow, Nore and Suir in 2012 and will be used by the SSCS for a five year period. Therefore no new information of the proportions of 1SW:MSW is required. This revised split of 1SW:MSW salmon for these rivers undertaken in 2012 was based on the recorded salmon rod catch in each individual river over the full angling season over a five year period and would be more comprehensive than any estuary survey where the discrimination of fish from the Barrow, Nore and Suir would be difficult with a high degree of uncertainty.</p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) have been in contact with University College Cork, the authors of the Waterford Genetic Stock Identification Project (2011), in order to clarify the situation with regard the determination of the river of origin of Atlantic salmon caught as part of an experimental fishery prosecuted in Waterford Harbour in 2010.  They confirm, using their then standard panel of genetic markers for stock discrimination in Atlantic salmon (16 microsatellites) and an additional analysis using small number of randomly selected 210 SNP markers (SNPs then being in the early methodological stages of development and application), that it was not possible to categorically assign genetically fish captured in a mixed fisheries situation in Waterford Harbour to their potential rivers of origin, namely the Nore, Barrow and Suir. </p><p>  IFI are also informed by UCC that there have been substantial technological advancements in salmon genetic stock identification in the period since the investigation was undertaken in 2010 and 2011.   As a result DNA SNP marker panels with up to 250K markers are available, such that it might now be possible to develop a panel of markers based on subset of these, which could be highly discriminatory and specific to the rivers entering Waterford Harbour. However IFI are also advised that the design and development of such a panel would require a substantial research effort and there is no absolute guarantee of success.</p><p>  In conclusion, the recommendation for a new and extended closed-season survey as suggested by the Waterford Estuary Fishermen&rsquo;s Association is not required with regard to assessment of salmon stocks on the Barrow, Nore or Suir as there is a stock assessment method (rod catch) already in place for all three rivers. Also proportions of 1SW and MSW salmon has been revised recently (2012) by the SSCS to determine salmon conservation limits for all three rivers. One of the objectives of the 2010 survey was to provide a qualitative assessment of salmon stock abundance on the Barrow as no assessment was available at that time. Since then the Barrow has been open for catch and release angling and a means of salmon stock assessment is therefore currently in place. </p><p>  As set out above, the use of DNA SNP techniques is still at a developmental stage with no certainty of being able to discriminate salmon stocks from individual rivers in Waterford estuary. In fact, currently there is no requirement to discriminate individual stocks entering Waterford estuary as a stock assessment method is in place for all three rivers and the SSCS provide catch advice annually. One of the objectives of the 2010 survey was to determine the mixed stock nature of the estuarine catch but this is not a requirement in the current scientific assessment process.</p></reply>

This tendering process will still consider all proposals based on their approach to identifying and accessing vulnerable homes, involvement of local community groups and the benefits for local employment.

Th is amendment, if progressed, would allow Member States to restrict or prohibit the commercial cultivation of GMOs in their territory under defined criteria. </p><p>  On behalf of Ireland, I voted in favour of this proposal at Council.  Indeed, there was near unanimous support for the measure, with just two Member States abstaining on the day.  Since the Commission originally proposed this amendment to the Deliberate Release Directive back in 2010, Ireland has been generally supportive of the concept of individual Member States possessing greater powers and autonomy in this area. Nevertheless, and despite the considerable support expressed at the recent Council, Member States have found this a difficult file to reach consensus on and most have had to compromise to reach this agreement after four years of discussions.  The Italian Presidency will now seek an agreement with the European Parliament, and hopes to do so during its Presidency term.   </p><p>  None of the GM crops currently authorised for commercial cultivation within the European Union is considered to have characteristics relevant to Irish agriculture.

In such cases, the owner of the premises connected to the treatment system is obliged to register within 90 days of the connection of the premises to the treatment system. </p><p>Registration facilities have been available since 26 June 2012 and have been comprehensively publicised. Owners of domestic wastewater systems who have not yet registered may still do so and there are no late payment fees payable (but the discount for early registration no longer applies). Registration can be completed via the website or in any local authority office.   </p><p>The Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, introduced a grants scheme for householders whose treatment systems require remediation or upgrading following an inspection carried out under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 and the subsequent issue of an advisory notice under that legislation. A number of qualification criteria are set out in the regulations, all of which must be met in order for a grant to be paid. One of those criteria is that only householders who complied with the legal obligation to register their treatment systems by 1 February 2013 will be eligible to apply for grant aid. </p></reply>

I recently adopted a new Dormant Accounts Action Plan for 2014 that will provide diverse supports for disadvantaged communities, including measures to promote youth employment, employability and entrepreneurship, training for carers and support for people with disabilities. Measures under my Department will be administered by Pobal and applications will be invited later this year.</p><p>  The LEADER elements of the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme, for which my Department is responsible, will be operational in early 2015. The Programme will fund enterprise development, job creation, rural tourism and recreation initiatives. It will also target social inclusion through building community capacity, training, basic services for hard to reach communities and initiatives aimed at rural youth.</p><p>  In addition, the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA) was launched by An Taoiseach in April 2014. The report contains 34 recommendations which look at invigorating rural Ireland. An interdepartmental expert group is now being established to consider the CEDRA recommendations and to report back to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs with a draft work plan for moving forward the implementation of the recommendations.</p><p>  My Department's Local and Community Development Programme is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State and will be succeeded in January 2015 by the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP). These programmes aim to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing employment supports, training, personal development/capacity building and other supports for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas in society.  It is a locally accessible, frontline intervention, supporting disadvantaged communities.  </p><p>  The Government is committed to improving service delivery from the point of view of the citizen and my Department will continue its work in this regard. </p></reply>

However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes i.e. if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.   </p><p>The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas. Separate legislation governs refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds apply but only 50% of the rates paid was refundable.   </p><p>  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for a change to rating law in relation to the refund of rates on vacant properties and gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority's administrative area. This discretion allows elected members to respond to the differing characteristics of the local commercial property markets. The amendment does not make any change to the eligibility or otherwise for refunds as currently provided for in relevant legislation. The provision commenced with effect from 1 June 2014. </p><p>  I have not issued a direction to local authorities requiring them to write to owners of vacant properties is respect of rates issues. The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above). </p></reply>

An inter-agency road map <i>Sustaining Regeneration &ndash; a Social Plan for Ballymun </i>has been developed to build upon the work carried out to date into the future. My Department is committed to continued investment in social regeneration in Ballymun and in safeguarding the substantial State investment in this flagship regeneration project.    </p><p>A breakdown of the expenditure recouped to BRL over the period 1999 to 2013 is set out in the following table. A capital provision of &euro;10 million is being made available to support on-going regeneration projects in 2014. While it is expected that the housing element will be substantially completed this year, my Department will continue to support social and economic interventions in Ballymun over the medium term. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>6,732,405</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>20,346,410</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>59,409,394</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>73,856,201</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>72,674,400</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>74,288,270</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>98,339,979</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>52,815,000</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>48,919,930</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>75,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>63,577,376</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>40,001,618</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>20,519,155</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>30,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>18,919,515</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>755,399,653</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date is liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The Charge has operated on a self-assessment basis with an owner of a residential property determining liability and paying the Charge.   </p><p>The Household Charge was operational in respect of 2012 only, with arrears and penalties in respect of a 2012 liability being collected by local authorities, assisted by the Local Government Management Agency on a shared services/agency basis up to and including 30 June 2013.  Household Charge operational matters are a matter for the relevant local authority or for the Agency, including the issuing of certificates of waiver or exemption, refunds due in respect of overpayments made prior to 30 June 2013, and all associated queries.  The 2011 Act allows owners of residential property to apply for a Certificate of Discharge or Exemption or Waiver for the Household Charge. Effectively, these Certificates continue to be provided by the Household Charge Bureau on behalf of Local Authorities.   </p><p>A provision of &euro;200,000 has been set aside from the Local Government Fund in 2014 in respect of Household Charge administrative costs.

Appointments of the Local Authority Chief Executive members of the Boards of the Local Government Computer Services Board, the Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Management Agency (which was established on 1<sup></sup>August 2012, replacing the LGCSB and the LGMSB), are made by the County and City Chief Executives collectively.   </p><p>The Public Appointments Service   operates a new portal which offers a single dedicated point of contact to all government Departments, as a support to the existing State board appointment procedures. This service provides a mechanism for Departments to advertise board vacancies and it gives prospective candidates an opportunity to register their general interest in a position on a state Board and to be alerted to upcoming vacancies.   </p><p>Since July 2011, my Department has sought expressions of interest through its website, from suitably qualified and experienced persons, for consideration as members or chairpersons of the boards of State bodies under my Department's aegis. Expressions of interest can be made at any time and will be kept on file in my Department for consideration as vacancies occur. In considering applications, due regard is had to the requirements of the position, the qualifications, experience and expertise of applicants and Government policy regarding gender balance on State boards. </p><p>All appointments are made in accordance with the appropriate legislation governing appointments to each body.

The Board of Directors of the Environmental Protection Agency consists of a Director General and four Directors.  There are no non-Executive members on the Board. </p><p>  While the appointments are made by Government, it must choose from candidates selected by an independent statutory Selection Committee, following an open competition.  The composition of this Selection Committee is also specified in Section 21 of the Act and, where a vacancy arises, the Committee is required to select a maximum of three suitable candidates from among those who compete in an open competition.</p><p>  The Director General post is executive in nature, and under Article 25 of the Environmental Protection Act 1992, the Director General, if present, chairs meetings of the Agency.  Therefore, there is a dual role to the Director General post in terms of chairing the Executive Board and also acting as Chief Executive of the EPA, serving both governance and management roles, as well as that of the Accounting Officer for the EPA.</p><p>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht request to Chairpersons designate to make themselves available to the Committee was in line with a Government decision on appointments to State Boards.  However, given that the appointment of a Director General to the EPA is a process established under primary legislation and that the decision is made by Government from a shortlist of candidates, the appointment process must be conducted in accordance with the legislation.  This would not, of course, preclude the Committee from inviting a newly appointed Director General to meet with the Committee should it wish to do so.</p></reply>

A decision to allow local authorities to retain 80% of LPT locally and the power to vary LPT rates will facilitate further implementation of the local government reform programme, a core element of which involves greater devolution to the local government sector, through supporting enhanced local decision making on spending priorities.</p><p><b>Local authorities in large urban and commuter areas provide a wide range of services to those living and working in their cities and towns, and I recognise the importance of those centres and their role in economic growth. </b>There is, however, a need to recognise that the LPT base outside of the cities and main commuter zones is narrower and that there will be a requirement to equalise the income position of those local authorities in order to ensure that an acceptable standard of service delivery is maintained across the country.  <b>A direct comparison between urban and</b><b>rural authorities ignores the material differences in scale, service provision and demand that exist between authorities.  It also fails to take account of their ability to collect income from other sources, such as rates, and the difference in levels of public services received, which vary considerably from one local authority to another.</b></p><p>My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. </p><p>On 20 May 2014, I published the <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.

These Committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis including the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP).  They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.</p><p>SICAP is one of my key priorities and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process.  In accordance with the Public Spending Code, best practice internationally, legal advice and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, the Programme will be subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway. </p><p>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.  Joint applications are encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) are invited to submit joint applications.  Applicants at stage one of the tendering process must demonstrate that they meet the criteria for the delivery of services in the Lot(s) applied for.  31 &ldquo;Lots&rdquo; are being offered for tender, based on Local Authority areas &ndash; in some cases these may be divided into smaller units at Stage two.  Gaeltacht areas and the Islands have been included in the Lots for the respective local authority.</p><p>Partner Candidates have a role in the delivery and implementation of the programme.  All such Partner Candidates must be identified in the <i><i>Qualification Questionnaire </i></i>and a contracting arrangement may be required between the Lead Candidate and any Partner Candidates.  Candidates may rely on the resources of other entities in order to satisfy the suitability requirements on condition that they can prove to the satisfaction of Pobal that they will have these resources at their disposal when necessary. </p><p>I am satisfied that the procurement process underway is in line with best practice and that the procurement documentation on e-Tenders contains all the relevant information on the process.  I look forward to the outcome of the procurement process and the roll out of SICAP in January 2015.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.</p><p>Approximately 360,000 properties have been registered for the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge, which has raised in excess of &euro;417m to date over its five years of operation.  Proceeds from the charge are retained by local authorities and are used for the provision of local services.  It is not possible to state with any certainty the level of non-compliance with the Charge.  However, I am confident that compliance levels are high as a result of data matching undertaken with other public bodies, such as the Private Residential Tenancies Board, as provided for under the Act.  The amount raised by the Charge to date also indicates a high compliance rate.  The following table details Non-Principal Private Residence Charge revenue raised on a county basis by liability date as of 03 July 2014 based on data provided by the Local Government Management Agency.<table><tr><th><b>County </b></th><th><b>2009 &euro; </b></th><th><b>2010 &euro; </b></th><th><b>2011 &euro; </b></th><th><b>2012 &euro; </b></th><th><b>2013 &euro; </b></th><th><b>Total &euro;</b></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>879,880 </td><td>874,060 </td><td>826,620 </td><td>841,380 </td><td>758,380 </td><td>4,180,320 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>1,173,040 </td><td>1,142,320 </td><td>1,102,780 </td><td>1,096,320 </td><td>1,030,560 </td><td>5,545,020 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>10,472,080 </td><td>10,292,720 </td><td>9,694,960 </td><td>9,330,260 </td><td>8,710,360 </td><td>48,500,380 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>2,727,900 </td><td>2,592,420 </td><td>2,508,300 </td><td>2,412,700 </td><td>2,243,880 </td><td>12,485,200 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>4,057,660 </td><td>3,949,420 </td><td>3,675,960 </td><td>3,503,540 </td><td>3,307,520 </td><td>18,494,100 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>28,168,240 </td><td>28,034,100 </td><td>26,868,440 </td><td>25,809,580 </td><td>23,730,200 </td><td>132,610,560 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>5,781,960 </td><td>5,708,620 </td><td>5,409,840 </td><td>5,249,180 </td><td>4,834,640 </td><td>26,984,240 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>4,036,560 </td><td>3,906,440 </td><td>3,662,960 </td><td>3,562,640 </td><td>3,349,420 </td><td>18,518,020 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>2,717,060 </td><td>2,662,180 </td><td>2,526,080 </td><td>2,521,160 </td><td>2,287,900 </td><td>12,714,380 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>1,095,780 </td><td>1,109,900 </td><td>1,066,960 </td><td>1,068,160 </td><td>&euro;985,000 </td><td>5,325,800 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>870,480 </td><td>906,600 </td><td>860,780 </td><td>846,940 </td><td>&euro;793,800 </td><td>4,278,600 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>859,120 </td><td>825,040 </td><td>777,800 </td><td>755,740 </td><td>&euro;697,080 </td><td>3,914,780 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>3,420,240 </td><td>3,334,500 </td><td>3,156,740 </td><td>3,117,060 </td><td>2,834,800 </td><td>15,863,340 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>782,440 </td><td>772,340 </td><td>697,920 </td><td>721,160 </td><td>646,420 </td><td>3,620,280 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>1,718,040 </td><td>1,672,520 </td><td>1,533,040 </td><td>1,491,780 </td><td>1,333,140 </td><td>7,748,520 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>2,886,180 </td><td>2,785,620 </td><td>2,659,280 </td><td>2,567,060 </td><td>2,395,360 </td><td>13,293,500 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>1,902,760 </td><td>1,911,940 </td><td>1,817,760 </td><td>1,753,900 </td><td>1,612,860 </td><td>8,999,220 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>663,260 </td><td>656,440 </td><td>626,380 </td><td>623,200 </td><td>593,360 </td><td>3,162,640 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>824,240 </td><td>841,820 </td><td>785,180 </td><td>787,140 </td><td>701,180 </td><td>3,939,560 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>1,114,460 </td><td>1,082,040 </td><td>1,023,300 </td><td>1,018,180 </td><td>942,740 </td><td>5,180,720 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>1,743,340 </td><td>1,696,000 </td><td>1,591,640 </td><td>1,555,700 </td><td>1,423,300 </td><td>8,009,980 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>2,338,220 </td><td>2,252,300 </td><td>2,103,280 </td><td>2,120,380 </td><td>1,949,780 </td><td>10,763,960 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>2,336,900 </td><td>2,291,260 </td><td>2,138,300 </td><td>2,095,100 </td><td>1,904,940 </td><td>10,766,500 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>1,541,280 </td><td>1,534,240 </td><td>1,475,120 </td><td>1,454,880 </td><td>1,360,340 </td><td>7,365,860 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>3,373,020 </td><td>3,247,840 </td><td>3,154,760 </td><td>3,098,300 </td><td>2,947,820 </td><td>15,821,740 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>2,009,940 </td><td>1,948,340 </td><td>1,864,300 </td><td>1,792,180 </td><td>1,625,680 </td><td>9,240,440 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>89,494,080 </td><td>88,031,020 </td><td>83,608,480 </td><td>81,193,620 </td><td>75,000,460 </td><td>417,327,660 </td></tr></table></p><p>Part 12 of The Local Government Reform Act 2014, deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR charge.  The Act provides for a period, commencing on 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014, during which time no new late penalties will be applied to existing liabilities.  If payment is not made in full, or, if settlement terms are not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date is applied on 1 September 2014.  In addition, the entire NPPR liability is increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.  It is very much in the interest of non-compliant owners to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off grace period.  The NPPR charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment. Local authorities will be taking a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner.  Non-compliant owners should log on to <i>,</i>or alternatively contact their local authority and make arrangements in relation to their outstanding payments before 1 September 2014 to avoid incurring additional fees.</p></reply>

The timing and scale of this transfer is to be agreed by my Department and DSP in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, having regard to the necessity to ensure that sufficient funding is available for the on-going expenditure on the rent supplement scheme and the phased introduction of HAP. </p><p>  My Department is working on developing a robust financial strategy for the full roll-out of HAP, with a particular focus, in the first instance, on the scale of funds to be transferred to my Department to facilitate both the administrative and statutory pilot phases in 2014.  The three Departments concerned have agreed to a funding transfer from DSP to my Department for the projected initial programme costs, which is based on the movement of 3,595 cases into HAP across the 7 Wave 1 pilot authorities.  All three Departments are continuing discussion on the arrangements for funding the administration costs of HAP by local authorities, as approved by Government.</p></reply>

On foot of this commitment I asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to commission research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations in that regard.  The subsequent report assessed a number of different options for delivery of a scheme ranging from one where all elements are delivered by the PRTB to one where all elements are outsourced to a private operator.  The report examined each option in terms of both insurance and custodial type schemes. </p><p>In a custodial scheme, tenancy deposits are transferred to the scheme for the duration of the tenancy.  They are then repaid by the scheme operator following agreement between the landlord and tenant or following the outcome of a dispute resolution process in cases where there is no agreement.  The interest from the funds deposited pays for the administration of the scheme and there is no fee to either the landlord or tenant.  In an insurance-based scheme, the landlord pays a premium to insure the risk of the deposit not being returned but retains the deposit.  In the event of a dispute, the landlord lodges the total of the deposit with the scheme and it is repaid to either the landlord or the tenant at the conclusion of a dispute resolution process. </p><p>I considered all of the options presented in the report in order to determine how to offer the greatest protection to tenants at least cost to the Exchequer and secured Government approval for the establishment of a tenancy deposit scheme based on a custodial model.  Legislative provisions for the scheme are currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is my intention to introduce the amendments at Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 in the Seanad shortly.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres.  The most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Rent Index shows the extent of rising rents, particularly in Dublin and the major cities.  In Dublin, rents for houses increased by 6.7% annually while for apartments the figure was 10.3%. </p><p>The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and the Government recently published <i>Construction 2020 - A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>.  It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce.  As part of the Construction Strategy, the Government is committed to publishing a social housing strategy by the end of the third quarter 2014 which will set out a vision for social housing and identify ways to increase social housing supply over the next 5 years. </p><p>As regards the current year, over &euro;0.5 billion in funding is being made available through my Department across a range of housing programmes and it is expected that over 6,000 units will be provided for social housing.</p><p>Resolution of the housing supply situation is the key element in restoring stability to the market but I recognise that the provision of additional units of housing takes time. Consequently, I recently asked the PRTB to conduct a study to explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy recommendations.  I expect to have this report shortly.  My goal is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and emergency equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations.</p><p>  My Department has contributed in excess of &euro;169 million in capital funding over the past decade towards significant improvements in fire service infrastructure, fleet and equipment. Ireland is acknowledged to have   a good infrastructure of fire stations and an excellent front-line fleet of appliances, specialist vehicles and equipment. In recognition of the importance of continued investment in the fire service, the capital allocation was increased from &euro;5 million in 2013 to &euro;8 million this year. This was achieved notwithstanding the context of reducing capital budgets in line with Government policy on the management of the public finances.</p><p>  Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as one of the key national priorities for the fire services capital programme. In that context and in order to deliver cost efficiencies, a programme involving fire authorities aggregating demand and jointly procuring 17 fire appliances   is now   nearing completion. Following the success of this programme, further support from my Department's fire services capital programme for a similar initiative and other equipment or fire station projects will be considered within the constraints of available resources and will have regard to local authorities' priorities, the value for money offered by proposals, the totality of requests from fire authorities and the status of existing facilities having regard to risk categorisation.      </p></reply>

This legislation requires that the owner, or any other person in charge of a dog, shall not permit the dog to be in a public place unless the owner, or the other person in charge of the dog, accompanies it and keeps it under effectual control.  A person who fails to comply with these provisions shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &pound;1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both.</p><p>  Further restrictions apply to the control of certain specified dog breeds, set out in the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998, under which those dog breeds are not permitted to be in a public place unless they are securely muzzled and   led by a sufficiently strong chain or leash, not exceeding two metres in length, by a person over the age of sixteen years who is capable of controlling such a dog.</p><p>  I am satisfied that this legislation provides a strong basis for dog control measures. Its implementation is a matter for the local authorities, all of whom either directly employ dog control staff or operate a contract for that purpose. It is crucial also for   members of the public to exercise responsible dog ownership, in terms of compliance with the legislation, co-operation with local authorities and in being mindful of the impact of their dogs' behaviour on other members of the public.   </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from each customer in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p><p>I have used my powers under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 to issue a policy direction to the CER in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including the provision of free allowances and the calculation of assessed charges following on from the consideration by Government of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water. This direction applies for the regulatory cycle from 1 October 2014 to 31 December 201 6 and requires, inter alia, that funding provided to Irish Water should be used to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households. The direction notes that normal consumption is estimated at 38,000 litres annually per child of water supplied and waste water treated and this is to be verified through actual consumption data from metering.</p><p>The direction also reflects the Government decision that bills will be capped at the relevant assessed charge level for those customers with particular medical conditions which necessitate high water usage. Qualifying medical conditions will be set out, following consultation with the Minister for Health and the Health Services Executive. In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package. The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure will be developed by the Department of Social Protection.   </p><p>The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake   the water metering programme. The meter installation programme commenced in August 2013 and will be implemented nationally as quickly as possible. The time frame and the allocation of resources for the installation of meters is a matter for Irish Water.</p><p>Of the estimated 1.35m domestic properties connected to public water supplies, approximately 300,000 properties will not be metered as part of the current phase, due to the cost or technical difficulty of doing so. These properties would include apartment blocks, other multi-occupancy buildings and houses with shared service connections. </p><p>Irish Water commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. This report was recently submitted to my Department and the recommendations of the report are being considered. In particular, my Department is exploring with Irish Water the potential to include a new phase of metering of some 48,000 apartments, which the report suggests can be easily metered as part of a separate procurement. </p><p>Households that are connected to the public water supply, but do not have a water meter installed, will be charged on an   assessed basis, primarily based on occupancy. There will also be provision for a rebate, when a customer moves from an assessed charge to a metered charge and usage is deemed above a reasonable threshold by comparison to the subsequent metered usage  . </p><p>The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it has submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER is responsible for approving the plan. It has already undertaken a public consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties and I understand that the CER has indicated that it will initiate a public consultation shortly in relation to other aspects of the water charges plan.  Full details of the CER's public consultation plans are available on its website ().</p><p>In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of Irish Water's first water charges plan, the CER must take account of the direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act and the CER will also take into account submissions received on foot of its public consultation on the plan and the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water.  The CER expect to announce the approved water charges in September 2014. </p></reply>

The Agency received the final options report last Autumn, setting out three main options for remediation. The Agency discussed the report in October with a number of stakeholders, including local elected representatives and Oireachtas Members from the area, local residents and business representatives.</p><p>  Taking account of these deliberations and their own analysis, the Board of the EPA considered the options report earlier this year and recommended one of the three options as the most appropriate. While there are a number of land ownership issues that need to be resolved in advance of actual remediation commencing, I expect my Department's consideration of the matter to be completed shortly and that the preferred remediation option would then be presented to Government. </p></reply>

The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished.  The then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure in 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised.  Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012.  Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence.  There were no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard from 2009.  In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure.  The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013. </p><p>  The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board.  The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. </p><p>  There have been two appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011.  A serving officer was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011, and a civilian doctor was appointed as ordinary member in November 2013. </p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011.  The then Minister for Defence appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.  As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised.  Details of Commandant Lagun's appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 13 January 2012.</p><p>  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.  A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process.</p></reply>

In addition, it also provides an immunity from prosecution, to those who were, or who still are, liable to be prosecuted for, desertion or being absent without leave.</p><p>There have been no Regulatory Impact Assessments carried out by the Department of Defence since March 2011.  The Defence Acts and Regulations made thereunder are for the most part, focused on the Defence Forces only and do not apply to the ordinary citizen or to business.  Notwithstanding this, the Department applies the principles set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) Guidelines issued by the Department of the Taoiseach where appropriate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-08a.1417.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800077#WRU04500"><p>The question of retirement or discharge of a member of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) on medical grounds is governed by Defence Forces Regulations.  As regards medical pensions, there are two separate pension codes applicable to Defence Forces personnel.  Retirement pension terms for PDF personnel are governed by the Defence Forces Superannuation Schemes.  These Schemes contain provisions for payment of immediate benefits in the case of retirement or discharge on medical grounds, regardless of whether the medical condition is service related.  Entitlements vary as they are subject to minimum qualifying service and are based on various factors, which include: date of joining the Defence Forces, pensionable pay, retiring rank and period of pensionable service.</p><p>  For example, an NCO or Private recruited prior to April 2004 must ordinarily have at least 21 years' service to qualify for immediate pension and lump sum.  However where the person is discharged on medical grounds and has 12 or more years service but less than 21 years, they qualify for a retirement pension and lump sum based on a proportion of 21 year benefits.  For those recruited since 1 April 2004 and before 1 January 2013, an immediate pension and gratuity is payable on medical discharge provided the person has five or more years of reckonable service.  For those recruited on or after 1 January 2013, an immediate pension and gratuity is payable on medical discharge, once the person has a minimum of two years of reckonable service.</p><p>  In addition to benefits under the Defence Forces Superannuation Schemes, the Army Pensions Acts provide for the grant of a pension or a gratuity to former members of the PDF in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service (whether at home or abroad), or due to disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with the United Nations.  The rate of disability pension or gratuity awarded depends on the degree of disablement attributable to military service, as assessed by the Army Pensions Board.  The Board is the independent statutory body established under the Acts to investigate and adjudicate on applications under the Acts and to report to the Minister thereon.  </p><p>  It should be emphasised that retirement or discharge from the PDF on medical grounds does not give an automatic entitlement to a disability pension.  Also, it should be noted that where eligible for both a disability pension and retirement pension, the Defence Forces Superannuation Schemes provide that the combination of both pensions is subject to an overall limit.</p><p>  PDF personnel who wish to receive an estimate of their entitlements under the Defence Forces Superannuation Schemes, or who want information on disability benefits under the Army Pensions Acts and the procedures for applying for same, may contact the Pensions Administration Section of the Department of Defence.  Information on retirement and disability pension terms is also available to military personnel on the Defences Forces intranet and from Barrack Personnel Support Services (PSS) at local level.  </p><p>  The Personnel Support Service (PSS) is a confidential information, education, support and referral service for Defence Forces personnel.  There is a PSS office in every major installation in the Defence Forces.  In addition, each Brigade/Formation has a civilian Defence Forces Social Worker whose tasks are to provide assistance and support to service personnel and their families where required.</p><p>  Finally, former PDF personnel are covered for the full range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, including jobseekers benefit, illness benefit and invalidity pension. They are also covered for hospital and medical services under the Health Acts on the same basis as other members of the community.</p></reply>

The service consists of quarterly independent assessments of my Department&rsquo;s ICT security measures and a biannual independent security review of my Department's ICT infrastructure.  This is required for EU accreditation purposes in order to maintain my Department&rsquo;s status as the EU-accredited paying agency in Ireland.  In addition, services for independent internet-facing application testing are provided for in the contract, where required.</p><p>  Following an open EU public tendering procedure held in April 2013, a contract for this work was awarded in June 2013.  On this occasion it was awarded to a different company than on the previous occasion that this work was tendered.  Following a review of the initial 12 month period of the contract, my Department and this company agreed to an extension of the contract for a further period of 12 months.  On the expiry of this service in 2015, it is envisaged that my Department will run a new open EU tender competition for this ICT consultancy work.</p><p>  My Department is also heavily reliant on high quality Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to both assist with the effective and efficient administration of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) based single payment and agri-environmental schemes and also in carrying out our animal health and farm inspection obligations.  Following an open public tendering procedure held in 2012, my Department awarded a contract to Compass Informatics to carry out a review of the operation of the Department&rsquo;s GIS systems and to produce a technical report on how to ensure that these systems continue to serve my Department well into the future.  The final report was completed as scheduled and a number of the recommendations are currently being implemented.</p><p>  In addition, my Department has a number of contracts in place for ICT infrastructure technical support and for contract programming resources, which have been retendered at various points since March 2011, using open EU tendering procedures.</p></reply>

Prices have declined since the highs of last year, not only in Ireland but internationally and also in our most important beef export market, the UK. However as the Deputy is aware, it is not for me or for that matter any Minister for Agriculture to determine beef prices, as this is a matter for the market and ultimately one between suppliers and processors.</p><p>Nevertheless against the background of the current concerns, I met separately with representatives of the farm organisations (IFA, ICMSA, ICSA) and meat factories (MII) in February and March this year. More recently, I invited key stakeholders, including farm organisations, beef processors and relevant state agencies, to a round table discussion on the future development of the beef sector on 17 April and chaired a second meeting on 3 June. The Beef roundtable provides a platform for positive engagement between farmers, processers and stakeholders in the sector. There have already been a number of initiatives in the wake of this forum. These include:</p><p>- The Beef Roundtable discussions will reconvene quarterly to exchange intelligence on market developments and forecasts particularly in relation to supply, demand, prices, product specifications, retail changes etc;</p><p>- I have committed to launching a &lsquo;Beef Pricewatch&rsquo; online tool to make price information more accessible and free of charge to farmers. Work is progressing and already as an initial step the department has improved its website in order to make price information more user friendly for farmers;</p><p>- My Department is examining the possibility of legislating for the<b></b>recognition of producer organisations in the beef sector. This initiative could provide a vehicle for collective action by farmers in a way that can give them the advantages of scale and market presence, as well as a useful vehicle for transferring technology and expertise to improve profitability at farm level;</p><p>- My  Department will prioritise its targeted on-farm capital investments for suckler farmers through the new Rural Development Programme;</p><p>- Bord Bia has allocated &euro;0.5m to expand and target promotion of Irish beef through its campaigns in the UK and in certain continental markets;</p><p>During the first beef forum, I had requested Mr. Michael Dowling, Chairman of the Beef 2020 Activation Group, to review the implementation of the Group&rsquo;s report, after intensive consultation with all stakeholders. That report has been delivered, and I have asked roundtable participants to reflect on its recommendations. In addition, last Friday I called on the beef processors to be more proactive in dealing with the current issues and implementing the recommendation in the Dowling report. </p><p>I also announced details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014, aimed at sustaining a critical mass in the suckler cow herd, the seedbed for our beef industry. This package includes:</p><p>- &euro;23m for the Beef Genomics Scheme;</p><p>- &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme;</p><p>- &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme; &amp;amp;</p><p>- &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. </p><p>Last week I submitted a draft &euro;4 billion draft Rural Development Programme to Brussels which includes a significant developmental component for the beef sector. Under the new RDP, beef suckler farmers will be eligible for participation under a range of measures, including:</p><p>- a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS. This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions;</p><p>- continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint) to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year;</p><p>- incentives for on-farm capital investment, including support for the expansion of the dairy sector following the abolition of milk quotas in 2015;</p><p>- knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions;</p><p>- a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd;</p><p>- a separate strand of the support for on-farm capital investment will be ring-fenced for young farmers at a higher rate of aid intensity of 60%;  &amp;amp;</p><p>- other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming etc.</p></reply>

At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter. In that letter, farmers are clearly informed of the need to carefully examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all unfarmed land, ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels. There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis. These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers. </p><p>In the letters which issue where ineligible areas have been identified, considerable detail regarding the issues and maps to advise of the particular over-claims, are provided, in addition to which farmers are also informed of the appeals process, should   they disagree with my Department&rsquo;s findings.  The appeals process I have introduced is both robust and comprehensive; in the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independent-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee. </p><p>  To date, some 10,173 appeals have been received, of which 6,671 have been finalised or in the final stages of processing. In addition, 2,545 cases are in the process of either ground verification visits or administrative validation. A further 957 cases have been received in recent weeks and will be processed as soon as possible. To date, 156 cases were referred to the Appeals Committee for consideration. These cases were reviewed by the Appeals Committee and the applicants will be informed of the outcome of their appeal very shortly. </p></reply>

I understand that these inspections carried out prior to race commencement are part of normal procedure.</p><p>The Turf Club has indicated that it undertook an investigation of events leading up to the race meeting and during the fixture.  The investigation included interviews with all the trainers and the riders of the horses that were killed, the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association, The Irish Jockeys Association and Turf Club Officials. None of the persons or bodies concerned attributed what occurred to the condition of the track, nor had they raised concerns about the ground conditions on the evening in question. </p><p>The Turf Club has indicated that the fatalities occurred on different parts of the track and that there was no commonality between the fatalities.  It has also indicated that it has sufficient powers under the rules of racing to address issues of this nature and in particular has made the following points:</p><p>- If the raceday stewards have concerns about any aspect of a day&rsquo;s racing such as the condition of the track, condition of horses etc. they have appropriate powers under the Rules of Racing to deal with each matter as it arises;</p><p>- The Turf Club hold an annual safety review with trainers, jockeys and officials and all aspects of safety on all tracks are reviewed;</p><p>- The Turf Club monitor fatalities rates at all tracks annually and take remedial action as required. </p><p>The Turf Club provide a veterinary officer at all race meetings,  who can make reports to the stewards if they have concerns about the fitness or well being of any horse and the stewards have power to order the withdrawal of any horse on welfare grounds.</p><p>In this regard the Turf Club has advised that following the incident at Clonmel, they will be sending extra veterinary officers to a selection of race meetings during the summer to carry out pre-race veterinary checks on a precautionary basis. In relation to any further investigation by my Department, the Turf Club has statutory responsibility for the enforcement of integrity in racing, and has sole and independent power to make and apply the rules of racing.  In these circumstances I do not consider any further investigation by my Department to be appropriate at this point.</p></reply>

It represents a niche in European food production where a speciality typical of the locality is produced in a common way.   In the case of a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) the product must be produced or processed or prepared in the geographical area and a specific quality, reputation or other characteristics must be attributable to that area.</p><p>  The concept is one of a local or regional food or &quot;&quot;terroir&quot; rather than national reputation. A previous application for Irish Beef was withdrawn as the European Commission did not accept that there were exceptional circumstances to justify the use of the name of a Member State in the proposed PGI.  The Commission also expressed reservations about an application to register 'Northern Ireland Beef' as a PGI.</p><p>  Since then producer bodies and agencies have from time to time explored the possibility of a joint application but have not to date reached a shared position.  If a consensus develops on the value of applying for an all island 'Irish Beef' PGI, my Department and its agencies will work with producer bodies and our counterparts on this matter.  While the regulation now permits the use of the name of a Member State on a GI , however the qualities of the product have to be the same and it must be demonstrated how the same geographical and human factors throughout the whole geographical area have produced this product. There is furthermore, a very significant difficulty in establishing a PGI where, as in the case of beef, labelling rules already require the declaration of the Member State of origin.</p><p>  Applications are developed by producer groups and are submitted by Member States who may agree that one Member State should submit the joint application.  An application may cross more than one jurisdiction if the geographical area and region share the particular characteristics.  I have discussed this with Minister O&rsquo;Neill and we will continue to work together to support the development of opportunities for Irish beef farmers.</p></reply>

This policy aims to limit the spread of TB infection within badgers and, as a result, their role as a vector of infection to the local cattle population. It is widely recognised among the scientific community that TB is maintained independently in both cattle and badgers that share the same environment and that there is interspecies transmission.  This leads to spill back to cattle initiating an outbreak and leading to recurring bovine-to-bovine disease spread within cattle herds.</p><p>  Under the wildlife strategy operated by my Department, badgers are removed in areas where they are associated with serious TB breakdown in cattle.  Capturing is undertaken under licence, issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, following an epidemiological investigation carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate that has found that badgers are the likely source of infection.  Approximately 6,000 badgers are removed annually under the programme.  However, the D/AHG licence issued to my Department limits capture to a maximum of 30% of the agriculture land at a national level so as to ensure that the badger population remains viable and not under threat.  This limit ensures that Ireland remains in compliance with the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Berne Convention. The success of this strategy can be seen from the fact that   the disease level in badgers is about half of what it had been in 2002.</p><p>  My Department also invests in extensive research in relation to badger ecology and vaccination programmes.  The aim of this research is to replace badger culling with vaccination when research currently being undertaken demonstrates that this is a practicable proposition.  However, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term.  In my earlier reply, I drew attention to the progressive and significant improvements in the TB situation in recent years with levels at the lowest since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s.  I fully recognise that, despite the progress made, the disease remains a real problem for those, albeit lower numbers of herd owners, affected.  The eradication programme also continues to represent a significant cost to the State, notwithstanding the expenditure reductions achieved as result of the lower disease incidence.  It is therefore in the interests of all concerned to build on the progress made to work towards eradication of the disease.</p></reply>

As outlined in the ISI&rsquo;s Quarter 1 Statistical Report, the number of cases as at 31 March 2014 was as follows:<blockquote>- 55 Debt Solution Arrangements Approved (44 Debt Relief Notices, 7 Debt Settlement Arrangements and 4 Personal Insolvency Arrangements);<br /><br />- 523 cases in progress - (320 PIAs, 121 DSAs and 82 DRNs);<br /><br />- 70 Protective Certificates issued by the Courts. (Protective Certificates give protection to debtors against legal action by creditors for a period and allows a Personal Insolvency Practitioner 70 days in which to develop an arrangement);<br /><br />- 66 bankruptcies in the first Quarter of 2014.</blockquote>In terms of other engagement with the Service, I can advise the Deputy that since 2013 the ISI has received almost 11,000 telephone calls to its information line and 2,500 email enquiries.  The ISI website had in excess of 166,000 website visits and more than 55,000 documents were downloaded from the site.  The ISI has advised that it does not have data available on the number of cases that dealt specifically with mortgage arrears.</p></reply>

What has been proposed in this Bill represents international best practice. Nonetheless, international legislation in this area is rapidly evolving and new approaches are being developed all the time.  This has necessitated extensive consultation on the Bill.  The Bill&rsquo;s publication in July 2013 was followed in September by a consultation symposium organised by my Department, by the D&aacute;il Second Stage debate in December 2013, and by a second consultation process undertaken by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, in Spring 2014.</p><p>  All of these processes identified areas of the Bill which required amendment to ensure a better fit with the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Amending provisions are being drafted by the Department in tandem with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. These will be introduced at Committee Stage which is currently awaited. In addition, provisions on Advance Healthcare Directives will be incorporated at Committee Stage. The aim is to enact the legislation this year.</p><p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Government intends to proceed to ratification of the Convention as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.</p><p>  An interdepartmental committee on the Convention is reviewing the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  As part of its work programme, the committee has identified issues to be considered by various Departments and examination of these issues is ongoing.  At the request of the committee, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is also assisting in assessing remaining requirements for ratification to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary.</p></reply>

As already announced, this Bill will provide for the consolidation into one piece of legislation of the current provisions regarding maternity, adoptive, parental and carer's leave.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government agreed, in 2013, not to oppose a Private Members' Bill introduced in Seanad &Eacute;ireann by Senator Mary White, which provides for the sharing by the mother and father of the current maternity leave provision.  The Government supports the principle of such flexibility, but the precise details of how this might be achieved need further consideration and consultation.   Minister of State Lynch on behalf of the Government has indicated in the Seanad debates on the Bill that significant detailed amendments would be required and work is ongoing within my Department in this regard.  I might also mention the current provision of 18 weeks unpaid parental leave is available to each parent per child.  This was increased to 18 weeks from the previous applicable allowance of 14 weeks in 2013.</p></reply>

The position in this regard has not changed.<blockquote>The troubles on this island exacted a tragic human cost in terms of the lives lost, people injured and families bereaved.  The impact of the many atrocities perpetrated over the course of the troubles lives long in our memory and is felt to this very day.  Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.<br /><br />As part and parcel of addressing the legacy of conflict for victims, the Government established the Remembrance Commission.  Over the lifetime of the Remembrance Commission from 2003 to 2008 &euro;3.87 million in funding was made available to individual victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland resident in this jurisdiction to acknowledge their suffering, to address economic hardship and certain medical expenses.  A significant amount of funding was also made available directly to Justice for the Forgotten, a group which supports many of the victims.<br /><br />The exceptional payments element of the Remembrance Commission scheme provided for the possibility for payment of counselling expenses incurred prior to the establishment of the scheme, in the circumstances outlined in the scheme.  Some ongoing counselling services were provided through Justice for the Forgotten.<br /><br />Although it was not possible for my Department to continue funding Justice for the Forgotten, I am happy to inform the Deputy that the group was recently awarded funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under its Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds to allow it to continue the important work it carries out for the victims it represents.<br /><br />I might add that while it is not possible to extend the nature of the schemes administered by my Department's Victims of Crime Office, I can reiterate the assurances given previously that funding for certain ongoing medical needs of the people who sustained injuries in the bombings has been and will continue to be provided through my Department&rsquo;s Victims of Crime Office.</blockquote></p></reply>

In that regard, he will be aware that the Acting Commissioner has directed an immediate, comprehensive review and strategic realignment of Garda capacity to deal with emerging crime of this nature.  In addition, the Acting Commissioner has recently put in place a number of new structures, processes and procedures, for implementation with immediate effect within the Computer Crime Investigation Unit, to address the issues of concern which have arisen regarding processing times.  I am advised that this will immediately halt the growth in outstanding cases and begin to address the backlog.</p><p>  These measures include the introduction of new 'triage' arrangements so as to maximise use of skilled resources, prioritisation of training to ensure a further 8 Forensic Examiners are fully trained and operational by end July, and a new approach to the management of the process which will double the closure rate by the end of the third quarter of 2014.  Investment in high powered computers is also to be accelerated, and structures are to be put in place for fast-tracking cases that require early intervention.    I am further advised that an in-depth review of this approach will be concluded by end 2014 to ensure that the desired increase in output is being delivered.</p><p>  As I have previously indicated to the Deputy, I am determined to ensure that we are in a position to respond effectively to the abuse of children through child pornography and therefore very much welcome these proactive and practical steps being taken by the Acting Commissioner.  My Department will remain in regular contact with the Garda authorities concerning their impact, and with respect to the broader review which the Acting Commissioner has also initiated.</p></reply>

The Women&rsquo;s Strategy  sets out how the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service will work together, as well as with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners, to provide women focused interventions to help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally. This co-operative approach is a direct result of the Joint Strategy published last year which aims to deliver more effective offender management.</p></reply>

The term State Boards is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.  Details of all appointments and vacancies which occurred since March 2011 are set out below along with details of those cases where expressions of interest were sought.</p><p><b><i>Charities Regulatory Authority Board</i></b></p><p>On 30 April 2014, my predecessor Alan Shatter, T.D. announced sixteen appointments to the Board of the Charities Regulatory Authority that is to be established later this year under the terms of the 2009 Charities Act.  These appointments followed a selection process facilitated by the Public Appointment Service.</p><p><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management</i></b></p><p>One appointment was made to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management.  The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.  The Deputy should note that responsibility for the Children Detention Schools Board of Management moved to the Department for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January 2012.</p><p><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>There are currently nine vacancies on the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Following an invitation to the public to submit expressions of interest, a total of 44 applications were received.  I expect to make appointments to these positions in the near future.</p><p><b><i>Courts Service Board</i></b></p><p>The Courts Service Board has 17 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice. Nineteen vacancies occurred.  There have been 19 appointments, three of which were individuals nominated by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. including a civil servant from my Department.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board</i></b></p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government and consists of a Chairperson, a member nominated by the representatives associations and a member nominated by the Government.  The Chairperson is appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in agreement with the representative associations.  Four vacancies occurred and four appointments were made to the board.  </p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board</i></b></p><p>Nine appointments were made to board on 10 April, 2012. These positions were not advertised.  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only had a few outstanding cases on hands at that time.  The outstanding cases have now been finalised and the necessary steps to close the Board are now being put in place. The 9th appointee is a civil servant. </p><p><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board</i></b></p><p>Twelve vacancies occurred.  Eleven appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The Board consists of 10 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Five of the appointments were individuals nominated by myself or my predecessor Deputy Shatter.   </p><p><b><i>Legal Aid Board</i></b></p><p>Fifteen vacancies occurred.  Of the 15 appointments to this Board, nine were civil or public servants.</p><p><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board</i></b></p><p>Four vacancies occurred. Four appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.  </p><p><b><i>National Disability Authority (NDA)</i></b></p><p>One vacancy occurred in 2013. One appointment was made to the board of the National Disability Authority (NDA).   The appointment was made after seeking expressions of interest of which my Department received 12 applications.  This appointment was from a public applicant. </p><p>There are 13 current vacancies i.e. for 12 ordinary members and a chairperson.  An invitation for expressions of interest was placed on my Department's website and the appointment of board members is imminent.</p><p><b><i>Parole Board</i></b></p><p>Eleven vacancies occurred. There were eleven appointments made to the Parole Board.  </p><p><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>Four vacancies occurred.  The Government appointed four people on 3 April, 2012.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. </p><p><b><i>Private Security Authority (PSA)</i></b></p><p>Eleven vacancies occurred.  Eleven appointments were made out of which seven positions were advertised as the remaining four positions, in accordance with the relevant legislation, are to be nominated representatives from my own Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSA itself.  Following an invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 29 applications were received.  Six of the seven appointments made following public advertising were drawn for the applications received.  </p><p><b><i>Property Registration Authority</i></b></p><p>Three vacancies occurred.  Three appointments were made to the Property Registration Authority, of which, in accordance with the legislation, one is a nominee of the Law Society, one is a nominee of the Bar Council and the 3rd the elected Property Registration Authority staff representative.  </p><p><b><i>Property Services Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>The Government made six appointments after seeking expressions of interest of which my Department received 41 applications.  Those appointed were public applicants.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. </p><p><b><i>Property Services Regulatory Authority</i></b></p><p>Eleven appointments were made to the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA).  My Department received 114 applications after seeking expressions of interest from members of the public.  Nine of those appointed were public applicants, one is a civil servant and the Chairperson, who was a member of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Implementation Team, was appointed in order to provide continuity to the Authority which had operated on a non-statutory basis for a number of years. The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  </p><p><b><i>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission</i></b></p><p>On 8 September 2011, the Government decided to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to establish a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.</p><p>The 14 outgoing members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012.</p><p>In the case of the Human Rights Commission 3 Commissioners were appointed by a Government Decision on the 20 December 2011 and their term expired on 31 May, 2012.  The Working Group established to advise on the practical issues in relation to the establishment of a new merged Commission recommended that an Independent Selection Panel be set up for the purpose of appointing new and future members of this Commission.  This is in line with a fundamental requirement of the Paris Principles that the members of the IHREC be independent and that the selection process be independent of Government.</p><p>In November 2012, advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; members appeared in the media.  The Independent Selection Panel forwarded its recommendation of 14 names in March 2013. While the persons recommended cannot be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the Government has appointed 14 individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they will be appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation is enacted, on a 3 year and 5 year basis to ensure that the terms of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.</p><p>On 31 May, 2013, my predecessor Mr Alan Shatter, T.D. appointed 12 of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of 3 years, but which will otherwise expire when the Bill to establish the IHREC is enacted and commenced and the two Bodies are dissolved.  Future selection of persons to serve as members of the IHREC will be vested in the Public Appointments Service (PAS) as provided for in the IHREC Bill which is currently before the Seanad.</p><p>Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that expressions of interest are not sought in every case from members of the public who wish to be appointed to State Boards.  Some of the reasons for this are outlined above for example, (i) no expressions of interest were sought in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board who were dealing with outstanding old cases while the remainder of their work had transferred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, (ii) some of the members appointed must be officers of the Minister for Justice and Equality (see Property Services Regulatory Authority and Courts Service Board) and (iii) the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority appointments were made on a temporary basis, for continuity reasons, in advance of the introduction of imminent new legislation.</p></reply>

The programme is advanced in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. Funding for such works is met by the Office of Public Works.  I am advised that whilst, initially, this project was to be financed by way of public private partnership (PPP), the Office of Public Works (OPW) has recently been requested to develop the new facility by way of a traditional procurement process.  I am further informed that planning for the provision of this new Garda headquarters is at an advanced stage and that the Office of Public Works expect to begin the formal tender process in the near future. Subject to the completion of that process, it is anticipated that a contract for the construction of the Garda headquarters referred to will be awarded towards the end of 2014.  The Deputy will appreciate that as the formal tender process has not yet begun, it would not be appropriate to disclose the estimated cost of the project at this time.</p></reply>

Those measures include the notification system, also known as the "sex offenders' register", post-release supervision and sex offender orders.  Section 10 of the 2001 Act requires a convicted sex offender to notify his or her name and home address to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within 7 days of becoming subject to the notification requirement. Any change of name or address must also be notified to the Gardai within 7 days.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 allows a court to impose a post-release supervision order as part of a sentence.  Indeed, when determining the sentence to be imposed on a convicted sex offender, the court is obliged by section 28 of the Act to consider whether to include post-release supervision.  The court is required to have regard to the need for such supervision by the Probation Service, the need to protect the public from serious harm from the offender, the need to prevent the commission of further sexual offences by the offender, and the need to rehabilitate or further rehabilitate the offender.</p><p>  For the period of post-release supervision, the offender is required to comply with such conditions as are specified in the sentence for securing supervision by a probation officer.  In addition, the court can include a condition prohibiting the offender from doing anything it considers necessary for the purpose of protecting the public.  In addition, upon the application of the Garda Siochana, the Circuit Court can make a sex offender order under section 16 of the 2001 Act at any time after an offender's release from prison (or a sentence otherwise ceases to be in force) prohibiting him or her from doing one or more things specified in the order.</p><p>  Probation Service protocols for the management of sex offenders in the community set out procedures for effective supervision of sex offenders following release from custody. In managing these cases, the Probation Service works closely with the Garda&iacute; and other partner agencies to ensure the co-operation of and compliance by the offender with supervision in the interests of community safety.  The multi-agency Sex Offender Risk Assessment and Management (SORAM) model has been established to support enhanced levels of co-operation and co-ordination between the key statutory organisations involved in managing the risk posed to the community by convicted sex offenders. SORAM is steered by the National SORAM Committee comprised of personnel from the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Child and Family Agency.  Local SORAM committees case manage individual offenders using risk assessment instruments. While the appropriateness of accommodation options are considered by the committees in the course of their work, it is primarily the responsibility of the local authorities to respond to accommodation issues for persons leaving prison.</p></reply>

The Information is being collated by the Irish Prison Service and I will forward a reply to the Deputy as soon possible.  No level of inter prisoner violence or assaults on staff is acceptable.</p><p>Every effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  However, no regime can completely eliminate the possibility of violent incidents happening in a prison setting where a large number of dangerous and violent offenders are being held.  As the Deputy can see from the figures there were 758 incidents of violence recorded in prisons during 2013 and this includes very minor incidents.  This amounts to an average of 2.1 incidents per day among a population of approximately 4,000.  The Irish Prison Service has successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as, hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards, boss chairs and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence.</p><p>In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.  As a result, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the figures for 2013 represent an 8% decrease on the 2012 total of 822  and a 40% decrease on the 2011 total of 1274.</p></reply>

When this happens, the Governor will conduct an oral hearing into the allegation.  If the Governor is satisfied, taking into account evidence presented and comments made, that a breach of temporary release conditions has occurred the prisoner should be notified accordingly.  The reviewable temporary release is then revoked and the prisoner is taken back into custody.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and I have been informed that following a review undertaken in 2013 into the delivery of court services in the greater Dublin Area, the proposals which have recently been published by the Courts Service include a proposal to close the District Court venue in Dun Laoghaire.  The purpose of the review was to examine options to ensure that the Courts Service can continue to maintain an appropriate level of front line services to court users throughout Dublin city and county.  The review has been the first comprehensive assessment of the delivery of court services in Dublin in many decades.  In addition, the proposals arising from the review are designed to ensure the maximum utilisation of court accommodation and resources while at the same time providing opportunities for efficiencies across the justice system.</p><p>  The Courts Service recognises that the proposal to close the court venue in Dun Laoghaire would inevitably have an impact on a range of organisations and courts users.  In this context, I welcome the consultative approach which is being adopted by the Courts Service in seeking submissions on the proposal from any interested parties or local interests.  The Courts Service had originally sought submissions by the end of June but it has now agreed to extend the timeframe for submissions to early September to allow for the fullest possible consultation.  I have been assured by the Courts Service that all submissions received on the proposal will receive consideration.  It is intended that proposals arising from the review including the closure of the court venue in Dun Laoghaire will be considered by the Courts Service Board at a meeting in October.  I have been assured that any impacts on the administration of justice and/or any possible increased costs to the State will be among the matters which will be taken into consideration by the Courts Service Building Committee and the Board when considering the proposals.  It should, of course, be noted that the final decision in relation to the closure of any court venue is a matter for the Board of the Courts Service.</p></reply>

These patrols are informed by crime trends, demand led studies and footfall in the areas in question.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages extensively with business and community interests in the city centre area with respect to crime prevention, enforcement and policing concerns.</p><p>  In relation to the specific issues raised concerning the Temple Bar area, in addition to the patrols referred to above, I am advised that additional plain clothes foot patrols are assigned to the area and adjoining streets each Friday and Saturday night under Operation Aughrim.  A dedicated Public Order Van is also deployed to the area during the weekend.  In addition, a number of other city centre policing operations impact on adjoining areas of the city, notably Operation Pier, which concentrates high visibility patrols on the South Quays and Temple Bar area.  I can further inform the Deputy that in addition to these overall operational measures, two members of the Community Policing Unit at Pearse Street Garda Station are specifically assigned to the Temple Bar area and maintain liaison with the residents and other stakeholders in the area.  In this regard, I am advised that ongoing consultation is maintained with the Temple Bar Traders association and Dublin Business Improvement District (BID) and that the policing needs of the area are kept under ongoing review.</p><p>  In so far as the particular report referred to by the Deputy is concerned, he will be aware that a number of issues concerning a range of policies spanning a number of Departments emerged from its work.  My predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality welcomed the report and forwarded it to relevant Ministerial colleagues for their consideration as part of the ongoing development of policy in relevant areas.  The relevant issues raised in the report have also fed into Garda enforcement and prevention measures in the city centre, including those referred to above.</p><p>  With regard to the Deputy's request for specific information regarding public order offences in Dublin City Centre, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

While I am conscious of the range of concerns expressed by the relatives of Father Molloy, including their call for a Commission of Investigation to be established, I think it is important that I would have the benefit of Mr. McGinn's independent assessment, including with respect to the question of any additional inquiry, before engaging further with the family on this matter.</p></reply>

Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole. There are no proposals to change this assessment process.</p><p>  In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. Under the standard  means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for the over 70s, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs. </p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs. As I have outlined, this assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over -70s gross income thresholds.  </p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p></reply>

This amounts to &euro;766 million in 2014, including additional funding of &euro;20 million this year, as part of total additional funding of &euro;90 million made available since 2012 for new service initiatives. By the end of 2014, upwards of 1,100 new posts will be put in place, to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children and to develop other specialist mental health services.</p><p>  A Vision for Change recommended the establishment of 99 multi-disciplinary Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams to provide acute secondary mental health care in the community. There are now 68 CAMHS teams in place, compared to 54 in 2008. The additional funding in 2012-2014 is being used, in part, to expand and enhance the skill mix of these teams. Around 230 new post were allocated to CAMHS over 2012-13 and recruitment is well advanced. The increasing demands being placed on our Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services were reflected in the 14,000 or so to CAMHS teams in 2013. This was nearly 1,000, or 8% more, than projected in the HSE National Service Plan last year. However, the target of 70% of referrals being seen within 3 months was maintained.</p><p>  The reduction in the numbers of children admitted to adult acute in-patient facilities has been a focus for HSE Mental Health services for the last numbers of years, and progress in this area has been extensive. In 2008, only 25% of admissions of children to HSE acute in-patient units were to age appropriate facilities. By 2013, this had increased to 68% of admissions, and all efforts are being directed towards reducing this significantly in the future.</p><p>  It should be noted that the HSE also funds a range of non-statutory agencies, such as Jigsaw which receives about &euro;1.5million annually, on a partnership basis each year to help maximise tailored and flexible services for young people.</p><p>  In February last, the Department of Education published a guide to developing student support teams in post primary schools. This is an important resource for schools in promoting and protecting students' well-being, and an aid to establishing a team or reviewing an existing team. I would also refer the Deputy to the Minister for Education and Skills regarding implementation of the guidelines &quot;Well Being in Primary Schools&quot;, which comes under his aegis, and regarding the issue of supports in schools generally.</p><p>  The recent annual report of the Mental Health Commission, referred to by the Deputy, will be fully borne in mind by the Department of Health, and the HSE, in the context of further improving policies and services for children and adolescents.</p></reply>

The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine (Fampyra&reg;) in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website (www.ncpe.ie). The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.</p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes.  However, I am aware that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of Fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS.  The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the product which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drugs scheme.  The HSE met with Biogen Idec recently to discuss a potential revised application.  The HSE expects that Biogen Idec will submit a revised application.  The HSE will then re-consider the application in as timely a fashion as possible in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.</p><p>  In relation to the individual case raised by the Deputy, the HSE has been asked to investigate the specific issues surrounding this case and respond directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

The HSE has a Service Level Agreement with the Hospital and provided &euro;5.820m to the Hospital in 2013.  Patients are accepted from all counties and services include:<blockquote>- Accident and Emergency - 'walk in' and 'out of hours' - 7 days a week<br /><br />- Secondary care provided by undergraduate and postgraduate students and<br /><br />- Specialist and tertiary care provided by consultants and multidisciplinary dental teams for special needs patients and patients who require special care.</blockquote>At 1 June 2014, there was a total of 6,009 patients on waiting lists for either assessment/screening or treatment, of which 758 were waiting for over one year with the longest waiting time of eighteen months.  A small number of cases are awaiting theatre slots in general or paediatric hospitals because of their needs.  Waiting times vary based on referral type and needs of patients.  All referrals are assessed by a lead clinician and if deemed urgent every effort is made to see the patient within a number of weeks. Routine referrals waiting times can range from six months to over  one year. Patients suitable for treatment by undergraduates are normally treated within one academic year.  Over 91,000 treatments and over 23,000 diagnostic procedures were carried out in the Dublin Dental Hospital in 2013.  The HSE also has a Service Level Agreement with Cork Dental School and Hospital.</p><p>Under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme for adult medical card holders the HSE makes available, through contracted dentists, free emergency dental treatment with a focus on relief of pain and sepsis to all eligible patients.  The HSE National Service Plan 2014 made provision for an additional &euro;12m for the DTSS in recognition of the growth in eligibility.  Emergency care for children up to 16 years of age and treatment for special needs patients are among the priorities for the Public Dental Service of the HSE through its dental clinics.  The Department has begun a three year project to develop a new national oral health policy.  The project will have three key parts - a needs assessment, a review of resources and a consultation on new ways of delivering oral health services.</p></reply>

I also appoint members on the nomination of various bodies, again in accordance with the relevant legislation.  There were some exceptions to the advertising process in 2012 and 2013.  In 2012, the members of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal were appointed by me, on the advice of the Attorney General, as these members carry out a very specific role in relation to assessing the quantum of awards under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act.  Another exception was in the case of some hospital boards, e.g. Beaumont and St James&rsquo;s, where the term of existing members was extended as a prudent provisional measure, to allow time for appropriate competencies required in members of these boards to be set out, given the Health Reform Programme and its impact on hospital configuration.  Appointments of the new board members were subsequently advertised.</p><p>In 2012 existing board members of the National Paediatric Hospital Board were re-appointed for a 3 month period to allow time to consider the competencies required by board members into the future.

The Government is committed to the continued reform of mental health services, notwithstanding the substantial overall reduction in resources available to the health service in recent years.  Towards this end, ring-fenced funding of &euro;90 million and some 1,100 posts are being  provided between 2012 and end 2014 to develop community mental health services and suicide prevention resources.  The budget for mental health services in 2014 is significant at approximately &euro;766 million.</p><p><i>A Vision for Change </i>indicates a requirement for 10,647 WTE staff which, when adjusted for the 2011 population census, equates to around 12,240 WTE staff by 2016.  However, given the changed economic circumstances since the publication of <i>Vision</i>in 2006, the Government had to reduce the numbers employed across the public service in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets.  While the health sector must make its contribution to that reduction, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling, and has the financial resources to do so.  The HSE Service Plan for 2014 commits to developing workforce planning to bring greater certainty around essential replacements, and the streamlining of recruitment to allow for more local control and specialisation, where appropriate.</p><p>While staffing levels in the mental health service have fallen, there are positives that must be acknowledged.  Many of the staff numbers lost were supporting the excessive numbers of beds which are no longer part of the service user recovery focused, modern, community-based model for mental health.  The overall reduction in numbers has been mitigated due to the priority ring-fenced Programme for Government investments in 2012, 2013 and again in 2014.  This has allowed the HSE to begin to re-balance the staff skill mix in mental health and to introduce new staff in the historically under represented disciplines recommended in <i>A Vision for Change</i>i.e. psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.</p><p>Recruitment of the additional posts in 2012 and 2013 is continuing with 95% of the 2012 posts filled as at the end of May 2014.  The recruitment process is complete for 68% of the 2013 posts, with the remainder in various stages of the recruitment process.  These posts continue to come on stream, and are targeted to be in place by the end of Quarter 2 of 2014.  Decisions on the breakdown of the new 2014 posts (between 250 - 280 posts) are being made by the HSE, following a business case and analysis process to ensure that the required professional grades are recruited to fill identified service gaps.  It is intended that these posts will be in place by end of 2014.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-08a.1762.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070800082#WRZ03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 695 and 696 together.</p><p>  In line with the recommendations of 'A Vision for Change', a recovery orientation should inform every aspect of service delivery and service users should be partners in their own care.  There is a growing recognition that, with a recovery approach, it is possible to live well despite any limitations caused by disability or illness.  I have acknowledged previously that there is more to be done in developing a focused recovery orientation for some patients.  I also accept that adopting a recovery based approach has not been without its challenges which include reconsidering some fundamental concepts such as what it means to be a service delivery organisation, a professional, a person who uses services or a family member, and how we judge effective treatments.  The Recovery approach that we want to see places a unique emphasis on the value of each person and their understanding of their illness and should be seen as natural process which service users believe can put greater choice and control back in their hands.</p><p>  As acknowledged by the Chairman of the Mental Health Commission in his foreword, the 'Advancing Recovery in Ireland'  (ARI) initiative which is a partnership project between the HSE and other bodies is a welcome development.  The initiative focuses on service level structures, systems and practices that can maximise personal recovery opportunities and outcomes for service users.  It aims to achieve this by facilitating the individual to manage their personal recovery and by the development of recovery focused mental health practice in the service.  It recognises the service provider, service user and family as equal stakeholders.  Some of the innovations being developed through ARI are Recovery Colleges, Peer Support Working and the Recovery Context inventory Tool.  The ARI is an 18 month initiative which is being rolled out on a phased basis to allow maximum benefit, the initial phase of which commenced in May 2013.</p><p>  The Community Mental Health Team is the first line of acute secondary mental health care provision and their presence allows individuals to be supported in their recovery in their own community.  Community Mental Health Teams need to have expertise from all the core disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, social workers, occupational and other therapists as well as mental health nursing.  With this in mind, some 1,100 new posts have been funded by a special allocation of &euro;90 million since 2012 primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children and to enhance specialist community services.  To date, some 740 of the posts have been filled and the recruitment process for the remaining posts  is continuing by the HSE.</p><p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 is the key piece of legislation regarding the rights of people involuntarily detained and treated in approved centres within our mental health services.  The Act is currently under review, and an Expert Group set up by me in September 2012 is currently finalising its deliberations.  I expect to receive its report by the third quarter of 2014.  Whilst I am not in a position to comment on any recommendations of the Expert Group in advance of the completion of the final report, I would expect that the Group will take into account the importance of recovery when finalising their report.</p></reply>

The Commission also appoints the Inspector of Mental Health Services, who in accordance with the Act, is required to visit and inspect every approved centre annually and, as the Inspectorate think appropriate, to visit and inspect any other premises where mental health services are being provided.</p><p>  I welcome the Annual Report of the Mental Health Commission and note the specific areas of service provision which require improvement that have been highlighted by the Chairman.  Under the 2001 Act, the Commission has a number of powers in relation to approved centres which includes the attachment of any conditions it considers appropriate to the registration of such centres and such conditions could include the requirement to introduce or to review specified policies, protocols and procedures relating to the care and welfare of patients and residents.  In addition, the Commission can prepare codes of practice for the guidance of persons working in the mental health services.  As a consequence of the Commission carrying out its functions, I am satisfied that the rights of patients are regularly and appropriately reviewed in line with our mental health legislation.</p><p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 provides the legislative framework within which people who require admission on a voluntary or involuntary basis can be cared for and treated in approved centres within our mental health services.  The 2001 Act introduced a human rights ethos into our mental health law and it is currently under review by an Expert Group which I set up in September 2012.  I expect to receive the final report of the Expert Group by the end of quarter 3 this year and while I am not in a position to comment on any specific recommendations of the Expert Group in advance of its final report, I would expect that the Group has considered  the matters raised by the Chairman with a view to ensuring that the human rights of patients are upheld and strengthened further.</p></reply>

Many GPs in Ireland are private practitioners and the hours that a private practice is open varies.  GPs have a variety of arrangements in place to provide cover for patients over a 24 hour period.  These include rotas with other colleagues or deputising services.  The Minister for Health has no role in relation to the running of a private practice.</p><p>  On 30th April 2014, 2,416 GPs held a General Medical Services (GMS) contract, providing services on behalf of the HSE.  The GMS contract states that the medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.</p><p>  Under Section 10 of the GMS contract, the GP shall be routinely available for consultation by eligible persons at his/her approved surgery or surgeries and for domiciliary visiting for a total of 40 hours each week, on five days or more in the week, by agreement with the HSE.  The GP's hours of availability shall have regard to his/her patients' needs in the locality and the GP shall not  amend their hours without the agreement of the HSE.  The medical practitioner shall also make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with him/her or his/her locum/deputy outside normal hours for urgent cases.  The GP must make known to their patients their hours of routine availability by way of notice in their practice premises.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().</p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes.</p><p>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. The HSE met with Biogen Idec recently to discuss a potential revised application. The HSE expects that Biogen Idec will submit a revised application. The HSE will then re-consider the application in as timely a fashion as possible in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will have a choice of health insurer and access to a standard package of health services.  In addition, a system of financial protection will ensure affordability by paying or subsidising UHI premiums for those who qualify. </p><p>The<i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance</i>was published on 2nd April and is available on my Department's website at www.health.gov.ie.  It provides substantial detail on the UHI model for Ireland, the process for determining the future health basket, including the standard package of services covered under UHI, funding mechanisms and the key stages of the journey to UHI.  The aim is to have all necessary preparatory work for UHI in place by early 2016 with a view to full implementation of UHI by 2019. </p><p>Since publication of the White Paper, work on key areas to advance UHI has been underway, including:</p><p>- Ongoing preparatory work to establish an Expert Commission which will consult widely and make recommendations in relation to the scope and composition of the future health basket is being carried out.</p><p>- The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children has been invited to develop a Values Framework which will help inform the work of the Expert Commission in making recommendations on the services for inclusion in the future health basket.  It is hoped that it will be in a position to commence hearings with stakeholders in the coming months. </p><p>The issue of the health basket is of central importance and the Government has identified overarching principles which will ensure that decisions in relation to the health basket are aligned with national health policy and with the overall strategic direction of the health service in Ireland, including:</p><p>- The composition of the health basket should acknowledge and promote the key role of primary care at the heart of the health system.  It should also facilitate the delivery of integrated, person-centred care provided at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to home as possible.</p><p>The question of providing for primary home care will be considered in this context.</p></reply>

The Agency may place the child in care, in a placement that meets the child's needs.  Ninety two per cent of children in care are placed in family foster care.   </p><p>Under the Child Care Regulations 1995, each child in statutory care is required to have an allocated social worker whose statutory duties, include inter-alia, the preparation and review of a care plan, finding appropriate placements for and in consultation with the child, consideration of the wishes of the child and family including contact with parent(s), siblings and extended family, addressing education placement and health needs of the child, and visits to placements to ensure that it is meeting the child&rsquo;s needs. </p><p>At the end of April 2014, the Child and Family Agency state that there were 6,492, children in statutory care in a range of care settings, six of these children were placed in a residential disability unit.  <b></b></p><p>HIQA has advised that in cases where children are in the care of the State, with the agreement of their parents that the same legal requirements of the Child and Family Agency are in place. </p><p>HIQA has further advised that there are some children living in designated centres with the agreement of their families.  Such children are not in the care of the State and do not have to have a statutory care plan.  The parent(s) of such a child retain(s) full parental rights and there is no requirement for the child to have a social worker.</p><p>Under the &quot;HIQA National Standards for Residential Services for Children and Adults with Disabilities&quot;, all children who live in designated centres should have a clear care plan, which includes the voice of the child, and arrangements should be in place to safeguard children.

Such services greatly reduce the risk of the use of contaminated injecting equipment through providing sterilised needles, syringes and associated injecting paraphernalia.  They also reduce the dangers posed by discarded needles through the strong emphasis on the exchange of used supplies for new.  As well as the direct benefits of needle exchange services, they also bring people into contact with other services and increase the possibilities for further engagement aimed at reducing heroin use.</p><p>  Needle exchange services are broadly available in the Dublin area through the HSE and voluntary sector organisations.  The Pharmacy Needle Exchange Programme (PNEP) has continued  to expand needle exchange services outside the Dublin area creating accessible harm reduction services within the community  pharmacy  setting.  By the end of 2013, there were 97 pharmacies participating in the PNEP.  A further 30 pharmacies have been recruited to the programme in 2014 bringing the total participating to 127.</p><p>  My Department has no plans to introduce medically supervised injecting centres at present.  Rather my focus is on ensuring that there is an increased emphasis on providing the opportunities for people to move on from illicit drug use, through drug treatment and rehabilitation, to a drug-free life where that is achievable.</p><p>  The HSE have completed a review of needle exchange provision in Ireland, which is due for publication shortly.</p></reply>

This level of fluoride is deemed optimal for protecting the oral health of all age groups.  European Council Directive 98/83 allows for a maximum permitted concentration of fluoride in drinking water up to 1.5mg/litre (or parts per million), almost twice the maximum level permitted in Ireland.  In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. </p><p>  The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.  As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department.  This review is due to be completed by December 2014. </p><p>  The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, &quot;Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth&quot; (FACCT).  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.  In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) has commenced.</p></reply>

However, in an emergency admission if a private designated bed was not available and a private in-patient was accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge was not levied, although the private in-patient continued to pay the fees of his/her hospital consultant.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General estimated in his 2010 Annual Report that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance in public hospitals because they were not occupying designated private beds. That situation represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients. In effect, private patients were not meeting the costs of the hospital services they used.  It was, and is, my belief that situation could not continue and that the new charges makes sense. </p><p>  While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, an essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient. </p><p>  The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital and on that basis introduced legislation in 2013 to amend Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 which provides for the charging of private in-patients. Since 1 January 2014, private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to charges that range from &euro;329 to &euro;1,000 per day. It is not intended to reverse this policy.</p></reply>

I have also frequently confirmed, most recently in a Topical Issue Debate on 2 July, that given the budgetary constraints my Department is operating under it could not take on full responsibility for the increased project cost and the significant risks involved in the project.  While I was willing to consider assisting with the shortfall, this was explicitly contingent on significant contributions from other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive.   These commitments were not forthcoming within the timescale required for the INTERREG IVA programme.     </p><p>  SEUPB then decided to withdraw its funding for the project and to re-allocate the funding to other eligible projects in the transport sector so as to ensure that the EU funds were not lost.  </p><p>  As to the possibility of the Narrow Water bridge qualifying for funding under the INTERREG V programme, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the lead Department liaising with the SEUPB regarding the INTERREG V funding process. I understand that SEUPB has now published a draft Operational Programme for  public comment with a set of funding priorities.</p></reply>

From the 1st January 2016 date, this exemption will apply all year round whereas currently it applies during the months of July to October only. However, if such equipment is being transported at night time, it must comply with the requirements of the Lighting Regulations contained within Statutory Instrument 249 of 2014 &ndash; Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 2014.</p></reply>

The underlying principle for the recommendation was that a licence should determine a person's suitability to carry out a function and it should have no monetary value or be traded on the open market. The Report's recommendations were widely publicised to the industry, including through the National Transport Authority (NTA) website, and industry updates, as well as on the various taxi forum websites. </p><p>  It was intended that the measure would be introduced with effect from 1st January 2013 by way of regulations to be made by the NTA who have statutory responsibility for the regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector. However, it was concluded that it would be more appropriate to include such a provision in primary legislation. </p><p>  The measure was therefore included in Section 14(1) of the Taxi Regulation Act, 2013 which was commenced with effect from the 6th April 2014.</p><p>  In regard to the particular case raised by you, I have referred your question to the NTA for direct reply.

By adding marketing investment from the two jurisdictions, Tourism Ireland gains greater purchasing power and voice in overseas markets.</p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland was established under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, following the amalgamation of Bord F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann and CERT.  Its primary functions are the development of quality tourism product, domestic tourism marketing, tourism standards, enterprise support, capability building and human resource development for the tourism industry.  The amalgamation of Failte Ireland and Tourism Ireland would require substantive changes to the statutory and North/South frameworks underpinning the two agencies, which could only progress within a wider political and institutional framework. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate but I do not anticipate that it would yield substantial savings.</p></reply>

To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.</p></reply>

Since this date the staff of the former NEWB, including its Education Welfare Officers (EWOs), have transferred to the new Agency. The three service strands formerly under the remit of NEWB &ndash; the statutory Educational Welfare Service and the school support programme services (Home-School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme) under the DEIS strategy &ndash; collectively form the Educational Welfare Services of the new Agency. Within the Agency, the statutory Education Welfare Service has specific responsibility for the Agency&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  The appointment of EWOs is a function of the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  I have been advised that the position of EWO in Dublin 15 has been vacant, on account of a number of circumstances, since April 2012. I have also been advised that arrangements are in place so that schools in the area continue to have access to support from the Education Welfare Service and that currently this support is being provided by the Senior EWO in the area. The Agency has advised me that it has become necessary to prioritise those cases where students are out of school, expelled or have special education needs in complex situations. </p><p>  The Agency has advised me that a reorganisation of Educational Welfare Services within available resources in the greater Dublin area is being undertaken at present with a view to providing an improved service in a number of areas, including Dublin 15.</p><p>  Vacancies that arise in staffing in the front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving are kept under review and will be prioritised by the Agency, in consultation with my Department, in so far as possible working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment. </p></reply>

The SCP is a targeted intervention aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It involves 124 locally managed projects, including Le Ch&eacute;ile SCP, and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people. The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving. </p><p>  Since its establishment, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to projects within the programme. As with all major spending programmes, the School Completion Programme budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE). This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014. In 2014, &euro;24.456m has been made available to the Agency for the programme. The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to this programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the estimates and budgetary process having regard to the resources available to Government. </p><p>  I am advised that proposals are in process of being formulated by the Agency in relation to the funding for SCP projects in the coming 2014/2015 academic year, based on Retention Plans submitted to the Agency by SCP Projects for the next cycle of the programme within the available funding parameters notified to projects. As with all 124 projects, and in line with CRE requirements, Le Ch&eacute;ile SCP, which involves 1 post-primary and 4 primary schools, has been requested to plan for a reduction of 6.5% on its 2013/14 allocated budget of &euro;264,426. The Agency will continue to work closely with the Local Management Committee, schools and local SCP co-ordinator to assist the project in this process.</p></reply>

The Agency decides on the professionals and individuals invited to the conference and may include the Social Worker, the Principal Social Worker, School Principal, Public Health Nurse, family Doctor, Garda&iacute; and any other professional who knows the child and/or has been involved with the child. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the parents will be invited to attend.</p><p>  The purpose of the case conference is to decide on whether the child needs to be taken into Care (on a voluntary basis or by Care Order), where the child should live while in care; the contact the child can have with their family and if the child can return home.  It is crucial that a variety of professionals attend the case conference given the complexity and significance of all decisions made.</p><p>  Where a child is in the care of the Agency, the Agency will, in accordance with Regulations, review the child&rsquo;s circumstances. The review will examine how the current placement is meeting the child&rsquo;s needs and any health, mental health and educational needs.  Similarly, the Agency will invite the professionals and other individuals, for example, the foster carers who have been involved with the child, to the case review.  Where the child is old enough they will also be invited to the review. Again, given the importance of any decision made regarding the child&rsquo;s care and future, it is imperative that this is informed by the diverse range of people involved in the child&rsquo;s care and life.</p><p>  In relation to the section of the HSE that conferences are affiliated with, it would appear that the Deputy is referring to Child and Family Agency which was established on 1 January 2014 and has responsibility for child protection, family support and other key children&rsquo;s services. The expenses claimed by staff members who attend conferences are in accordance with the National Financial Regulations noted in the Parliamentary Question No. 255 of 12 June 2014.  It is not possible to provide the Deputy with the detail requested.  I am satisfied with the thorough process and welcome the attendance of professionals involved in the child&rsquo;s life and care to assist in the decision making for the future of such children who may need the care, protection and support of the State.</p></reply>

Following a meeting with a delegation of Russian officials in October 2013 my Department prepared revised draft wording on a number of specific points. This was forwarded to the Russian Authorities in February 2014. In transmitting these revisions it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.  </p><p>  The Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation have advised the Irish Embassy in Moscow that all proposed adoption agreements are currently on hold while the Russian Government considers proposals in relation to how they deal with adoption agreements in general. It is understood that the Russian Federation's Supreme Court recently made recommendations regarding adoption agreements and these are currently being considered by the Russian Government. It is hoped that following the Russian Government's consideration of these matters they will be in a position to examine and respond to the Irish proposals.</p></reply>

In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility. Pro-rata reductions are made in respect of the other services provided.  The overall charge is based on the total costs incurred by the facility in providing the service and can vary depending on the level of overhead costs involved.  </p><p>  Figures provided in the Early Years Sector Survey 2012 published by Pobal indicate that the average cost of full day care in a community facility is in the region of &euro;160 per week. The survey does point out that the cost in urban settings are at the higher end of the scale. </p><p>  The implementation of the CCS programme is closely monitored, with each participating service submitting a fees policy document to its local City/County Childcare Committee for approval.  This document outlines the factors which make up the overall costs of the service provision and also the cost to the parent after the application of the subvention funding.  This helps to ensure that qualifying parents receive the full benefit of the subvention provided.</p><p>  The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme supports parents who are endeavouring to enter or return to the workforce and who are participating in training or educational courses for this purpose.  Under the CETS programme childcare services are contracted to provide childcare places to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  This programme also provides part time and after school places.   </p><p>  Under the programme &euro;145 per week is provided towards the cost of a full day childcare place and the service is permitted to charge up to a further &euro;25 per week towards the cost of the place.  Childcare services providing a part time place under the programme that includes a pick up from primary school receive a weekly payment of &euro;80 with a maximum charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent.  The standard after school weekly payment is &euro;45 with a charge of &euro;5 per week to the parent.  Pro rata rates apply for parents who receive a reduced level of service.</p><p>  Two additional support programmes, which were introduced initially under the CETS programme, are also implemented by my Department.</p><p>  The After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme was introduced in October 2013. This programme provides after-school care for primary school children for certain categories of working parents for a once-off period of 52 weeks. I announced today along with my colleague, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton, T.D., a number of enhancements to the ASCC programmes which will expand the range of eligibility for the programme and provide a pick up service for primary school children at no additional cost to the parent. The changes announced today reduces the parental contribution from &euro;20 to &euro;15 per week with the programme contributing &euro;40 per week for the after-school care and now providing &euro;105 per week for full day childcare during the holiday period   This payment is to provide for holiday periods when the child would need full day care.  Pro-rata rate applies for parents who require support over a shorter weekly period. </p><p>  The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme was introduced in January 2014.  Under the CEC programme &euro;80 per week is provided with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent.  This support can be accessed by qualifying parents over a number of years.  Today it was also announced that this programme now provides part time care for children up to the age of 13 whose parents are participating in CE programmes.  The upper age limit was previously 5 years and the new age limit is part of a number of enhancements to the programmes that I announced today.  A further enhancement to the programme includes an after-school option which enables qualifying CE parents of primary school children to obtain after-school care at a weekly cost of &euro;15. The programme contribution for this new option is &euro;40 per week.</p></reply>
