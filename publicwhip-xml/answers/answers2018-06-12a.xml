Sport Ireland Coaching's main objectives include raising the standard, status and profile of coaching in Ireland to provide performers and participants with the best quality coaching through their involvement in sport.</p>  <p>  Working in partnership with the National Governing Bodies of Sport and the wider sporting sector, Sport Ireland Coaching leads the development of coaching in Ireland through the implementation of a quality coach and tutor education support programme.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland does not provide funding to cover the costs of football coaching badges and I am informed that it has no current plans to fund such initiatives. </p>  <p>  In relation to football, Sport Ireland invests in the Football Association of Ireland, primarily through the Youth Field Sports Grant.  This investment is broadly aimed at encouraging and creating more opportunities for young people to participate in football across Ireland.  Programmes are based on a shared ethos of developing the grassroots of the games, growing participation numbers, improving standards and embracing communities outside of the traditional base of the sport.</p>  <p>  In 2017, Sport Ireland invested over &euro;2.5 million in the FAI through the Field Sport Grant, of which &euro;305,000 was allocated by the FAI toward the support of Coach Education.</p></reply>

It also measures social participation in sport and provides key insights into the role that sport plays, not just in encouraging healthier, more active lifestyles, but also in fostering community spirit and developing social capital. </p>  <p>  The report presents some very positive findings.  It shows that 43% of the adult population regularly take part in sport, representing 1.6 million regular participants.  It also shows that social participation among adults is currently at 45%, equivalent to 1.65 million adults. Overall, over 3 in 5 adults are involved in some way with sport.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that there has been an increase in the proportion of the population that is highly active, with an increase from 30% to almost 33% of those now achieving the minimum level of activity set by the National Physical Activity Guidelines.  I would like to see that figure higher than a third and we are going the right direction.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the narrowing of the gender gap in participation between men and women, which is now just 4.5%, the lowest recorded since the Irish Sports Monitor Report was introduced in 2007. </p>  <p>  There are challenges for us in terms of increasing participation among the population generally and among those groups that are under-represented in sport.  The important work being done by Sport Ireland, the Local Sports Partnerships and sports organisations at national and local level is key in helping to achieve greater levels of participation in sport right across our society.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department is currently finalising a National Sports Policy.  The Irish Sports Monitor Reports have been extremely informative in the development of that Policy.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the development and implementation of public transport infrastructure including the provision of bus shelters.</p><p>The capital funding allocated under my Vote this year to the NTA will enable them to undertake substantial investment in public transport infrastructure.  This includes over &euro;80 million for the NTA's various bus programmes including &euro;3 million for roadside infrastructure which includes bus stops, poles, turning areas, interchange locations and bus shelters.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware from his previous correspondence with the NTA, and as I am advised, the Authority has developed a prioritisation framework to determine appropriate numbers and locations for the installation of bus shelters in metropolitan areas and in towns and rural areas.  The NTA's prioritisation framework sets out the following criteria:</p><p>A. One bus shelter in each direction at the busiest stop in all towns that have a population size exceeding 1,000 people;</p><p>B. A bus shelter at the two busiest bus stops in each direction in towns that have a population size exceeding 3,000 people;</p><p>C. A bus shelter at the three busiest bus stops in each direction in towns that have a population size exceeding 10,000 people; and</p><p>D. In locations other than A, B and C where such stops are served by 10 or more PSO services per day.</p><p>I understand that NTA's general approach is that Bus shelters will not be provided in towns that do not fall under the criteria set out in their framework, however, requests for shelters at specific locations should be referred to the NTA for consideration.</p></reply>

I understand that work on the draft Plan is underway and NTA will publish it for public consultation later this year.</p></reply>

A review of the 2017 round of the programme has now been finalised and published on my Department's website <i><i>(www.dttas.ie).</i></i>This review highlights  aspects of the 2017 round of the SCP that worked well but also suggests some further improvements which are being considered prior to the next round of the programme opening for applications.  It is proposed that all applicants who were invalid, or partially invalid, under the 2017 round of the programme will be allowed to correct their applications for the 2018 round without the need to submit a completely new application.  </p><p>Some of the other changes being introduced for the 2018 round require amendments to the Department's online application system and work in this regard has now commenced. Formal sanction was received last week from the Minister from Public Expenditure and Reform to open the new round of the programme.  Accordingly, I expect to make an announcement in relation to the timing of the next round in the coming weeks.  All clubs and organisations registered on the Department's online application system will be notified at that time.</p></reply>

This resulted in the severe curtailment in funding for road improvement grant programmes, including the Strategic Grant Scheme, in order to focus available funding on maintenance and renewal work.  </p>  <p>  The current capital investment framework marks a significant step forward in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes but it is going to take time for funding to build up to the required level.  For now funding will largely continue to support the maintenance of the regional and local road network.  While a limited number of improvement projects are scheduled to go ahead over the next few years, funding is not available to commit to additional schemes at this point.  </p>  <p>  My Department is, however, liaising with Cork County Council with a view to positioning the project for development in the post 2021 period.</p></reply>

Lane control signalling will also be installed as part of the project which will allow the closing off of lanes. </p><p>TII has provided an allocation of &euro;7.5m in 2018 to progress the implementation of variable speed limits on the M50. It is expected that the variable speed limit regime will become operational in late 2019 or early 2020. </p><p>In addition, the National Development Plan, which was launched earlier this year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, identifies a number of key public transport priorities including the BusConnects programme, MetroLink and the DART expansion programme.  These will be delivered by the National Transport Authority progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network that will match transport demand, alleviate congestion, provide an alternative to private car use and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade.</p></reply>

Accordingly, China and Hong Kong are important emerging travel markets for Ireland.  The new direct flights from Hong Kong and Beijing offer huge potential to build on progress made in recent years. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing the island of Ireland in overseas tourism markets.  It has a strong network in China, with offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu.  The organisation&rsquo;s activity in China involves establishing and building relationships with influential intermediaries, including the travel trade, airlines and media.</p><p>To coincide with the launch of the new flight from Hong Kong, Tourism Ireland invited a group of journalists to visit Ireland and to help get positive exposure for Ireland and the new flight through the media in Hong Kong.  Tourism Ireland also rolled out a multi-channel campaign with Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region in advance of the launch of the new flight between Hong Kong and Dublin.  In addition, it has launched a new website in China, <i>www.DiscoverIreland.cn. </i>The new site, specifically designed for use on mobile devices, is hosted in China and is therefore more accessible for prospective Chinese visitors. </p><p>As part of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s sales mission to China in May, meetings took place with representatives of both Hainan Airlines in Beijing and Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong, to discuss how to drive demand for and maximise the promotion of both services.</p><p>Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, along with Tourism NI, have developed and successfully piloted a &lsquo;China Ready&rsquo; training programme for the industry here in Ireland.  More than 20 tourism operators around the island of Ireland have already completed such a programme to help them prepare for Chinese visitors.</p></reply>

We have had the benefit of over 50 submissions received as a result of a very useful public consultation process undertaken in late 2016.  These submissions came from a wide range of stakeholders with a strong interest in the future of Irish sport, including Government departments, National Governing Bodies of Sport, Local Sports Partnerships and private individuals.  I wish to formally record my appreciation of all those stakeholders that took the time and effort to give us their views. </p><p>Following close examination of these submissions, further meetings were held with certain stakeholders throughout the drafting of the Policy document.  This in-depth process has informed decision making on the key challenges faced by the sport sector, and the complex issues that arise in addressing them. </p><p>I have previously outlined some key themes which emerged during this valuable process including:</p><p>- The vital role of education in the delivery of sports measures;</p><p>- The need for increased investment in sport, both in lifelong participation programmes as well as support for high performance athletes.</p><p>- The need for greater Cross-Sectoral Co-operation with sports stakeholders and relevant Government Departments, working more closely with Local Authorities in particular; and</p><p>- The importance of continued investment in Sports Facilities locally, regionally and nationally.</p><p>The new policy will be published next month and the important themes that I have just mentioned will feature prominently, as well as some other important aspects of sport such as integrity in sport, governance and capacity building, and research and evaluation.</p></reply>

However, recent CSO figures show overall motor premiums for the year 2018 as being lower in comparison to those for the previous two years.</p><p>As you may know, the pricing of insurance products is a commercial issue for insurance companies, based on an assessment of the risks that they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p><p>The Department of Finance Working Group's Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  Based on recommendations from this report, the Advisory Committee on SPSVs met with Insurance Ireland on 22 May 2017 to discuss motor insurance costs relating to the taxi industry and a report on same was presented to me on 21 June.  I have forwarded that report to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael D'Arcy, TD who is the chair of the aforementioned Working Group.  The Advisory Committee on SPSVs and Insurance Ireland have agreed that there should be ongoing engagement between them and it is my hope that this cooperation and engagement will help to address the concerns of taxi drivers regarding motor insurance issues including the cost of same.</p><p>Insurance Ireland operates a free insurance information service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in obtaining insurance.

Importantly, the Government also decided to introduce primary legislation to give effect to the Regulation.  I have every intention of bringing forward a Bill that strikes a balance between the rights of local residents, the daa as the regulated entity and the broader national interest in recognition of the crucial importance of our primary national airport. </p></reply>

I am advised by National Transport Authority (NTA) that from December 2018 Maynooth services will be extended to off-peak periods as well as peak periods.

This integrated rail network will provide a core, high-capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Celbridge/Hazelhatch and Greystones.</p>  <p>  The remaining element of the overall DART Expansion Programme - the DART Underground Tunnel - is not scheduled for delivery within the period of the present NDP.  However, over that time, it is envisaged that the route for the proposed project will be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, it involves teachers taking these children outside for 15 minutes each school day, when they can either run or walk around their playground.  It has been found that about 50% of the children can typically run for a mile during that time, with others running slightly shorter or longer distances depending on individual capability.  It is a fantastic initiative and I fully support it.</p>  <p>  I had the privilege of being invited by Athletics Ireland to launch the initiative on a pilot basis in two schools in Dublin and Kerry in April.  The programme is organised and run by Athletics Ireland, in cooperation with the Department of Education and Skills and the relevant school authorities.  Its further roll out on a wider basis to other schools is accordingly an issue for consideration by those organising and running the programme.  My Department or Sport Ireland does not have a function to exercise in that context.</p>  <p>  While neither my Department nor Sport Ireland are in a position to decide on the extent to which the Daily Mile initiative may be rolled out to more schools, I would hope that this will prove possible.  My Department will shortly launch its new National Sports Policy, which aims at increasing the level of sports participation across the population, with a particular focus on participation and physical literacy levels of school-aged children and young people.  Engagement by schools with programmes such as the Daily Mile will be extremely important as we begin to implement the actions in this new Policy.</p></reply>

Essentially the route involves upgrade/realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo. </p>  <p>  In relation to the national element as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects within its capital budget is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. This is also the case for the M3 and N2 schemes mentioned by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's question to TII for direct reply in relation national roads.  Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p>  <p>  As regards the regional road aspect of a proposed east-west link, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  My Department did provide funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) of over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design.  At an estimated cost of the order of &euro;150 million, it has not been possible to date to include the East-West Link in capital investment plans.  I have, however, made an allocation available this year to allow an updated project appraisal for such a scheme to be prepared.</p></reply>

The next four years will see over &euro;110million allocated to develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. In addition, I have also secured funding of &euro;135million over the same period for sustainable transport projects in the five cities.  These projects will  also improve, directly and indirectly, both the cycling and walking infrastructure in the cities in question, and the efficiency and safety of their existing infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  As well as that, the significant investment planned in the BusConnects programme will also deliver an extensive new network of cycle lanes, greatly improving the safety of our cyclists.  My Department also spends over &euro;2.5million per annum on behavioural programmes to encourage a modal shift and to increase safety and awareness among all road users.</p>  <p>  In relation to the minimum passing distance, draft regulations providing for an amendment to article 10 of the Road Traffic (Traffic &amp;amp; Parking) Regulations 1997 were submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for consideration and settling.  As that process identified a number of complex issues, legal advice was sought within the Office of the Attorney General.  The Department is currently giving consideration to that advice and will shortly be engaging with the AGO to resolve outstanding issues.</p>  <p>  Finally, as regards the National Greenways Strategy my Department is currently finalising the Strategy and  I expect to be in a position to publish in the coming weeks.  The Strategy will provide a framework for the development of Ireland's greenways ensuring the best possible return for State investment.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Strategy will determine the type of project that will be funded over the coming decade by my Department and will set out guidance and options for project promoters in relation to the challenges faced in delivering greenway infrastructure.  It will also emphasise the need for early and wide consultation by project promoters with communities and affected landowners.</p></reply>

In terms of the measures being taken to work towards equality, I think that the Deputy will be interested to hear that real and substantial progress is being made in the sports participation rates of men and women. </p>  <p>  Just over a decade ago, in 2007, there was a gap of almost 16% in active participation levels between genders.  In the intervening decade, we have narrowed this gap to just 4.5% in 2017 according to the recently published Irish Sports Monitor Annual Report. </p>  <p>  In the last four years alone, Sport Ireland has allocated almost &euro;2,400,000 in specific Women in Sport funding to 31 different National Governing Bodies of Sport.  This investment is clearly delivering strong results. </p>  <p>  We will continue to work towards the achievement of parity in the area of active participation in sport by gender. My Department's new National Sports Policy aims at increasing the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population over the next ten years, with a specific focus on less active groups including women and girls.</p>  <p>  There is also significant work to be done in increasing involvement of women in areas such as coaching, administration and membership of Club and NGB boards.  This will be a focus of our efforts to strengthen the overall capacity of sports organisations as part of our National Sports Policy.  It is important to ensure that representation by women at all levels of sport is evident and becomes the norm into the future.</p>  <p>  The new National Sports Policy will be published in July 2018.</p></reply>

This programme will provide safe alternative active travel routes to help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure.  This investment is in addition to the substantial improvement in cycling infrastructure that will be carried out as part of both the BusConnects programme and the investment that is allocated for sustainable urban transport initiatives. </p>  <p>  My Department allocates overall funding to the National Transport Authority (NTA) that is responsible for the development and implementation of public transport and sustainable transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), who provide onward funding to the various local authorities who progress and implement cycling infrastructure schemes.

A review of the 2017 round of the programme has now been finalised and published on my Department's website <i>(www.dttas.ie)</i>.  This review highlights aspects of the 2017 round that worked well but also suggests some further improvements which are being considered prior to the next round of the programme.  Formal sanction has now been received from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to open the new round of the programme and an announcement in relation to the timing of this 2018 round is expected in the coming weeks.</p><p>In relation to applications that do not qualify for funding, a number of measures were introduced for the 2017 round of the SCP with the aim of reducing the level of invalid applications.  These measures included a shortened application form, the organisation of a series of regional seminars for potential applicants and more online validation to prevent applicants submitting incomplete applications.  These measures were largely successful and the invalid rate for the 2017 round of the programme was the lowest ever at 20%. While this was good progress, I am committed to lowering this figure even further for the next round.  In addition, all of the applicants who remain invalid following the conclusion of the 2017 round of the SCP have been contacted and informed that under the new 2018 round of the SCP they will be given the opportunity to simply submit the corrected documentation needed to make their 2017 application valid (for the 2018 round of the SCP), without the requirement of going through a full new application process.</p><p>With regard to larger sports infrastructure including swimming pools, the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) contains a commitment to establish a new &ldquo;Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund&rdquo; (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100m available over the coming years.  My officials have been engaging with relevant stakeholders in recent weeks and are currently drafting the terms and conditions of the new scheme.  An announcement in relation to when applications will be accepted will be made once these terms and conditions are finalised. </p><p>While the SCP already prioritises the needs of disadvantaged areas in the assessment of applications, the review of the 2017 round suggests that even greater weighting could be given to such applications.  This is one of the changes being considered for the new 2018 round of the programme and it is intended that the LSSIF would also have an appropriate element of favourable weighting for projects in disadvantaged areas.</p></reply>

The Annual Canal Cordon Report recently published by Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority - which provides data on trends in mode share of vehicles and people crossing the Canal Cordon in Dublin between 7am and 10am - indicates that a strong modal shift has been occurring in the Dublin City Centre area.  It shows that 70% of all inbound trips crossing the canal cordon were made by a sustainable mode which includes cycling, walking, taxi and other public transport.  Over the last 11 years, the share for sustainable modes has grown by 9 percentage points, and since 2010 there has continually been year-on-year growth.  The most recent figures show that the mode share for cars has dropped to under 30% for the first time; it is now 29.2%, compared to 40% as recently as 2010.</p>  <p>  In order to continue to build on this momentum and to encourage further modal shift nationally, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have secured over &euro;110m in capital funding which is directly allocated to develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford over the period 2018-2021.  A further &euro;135m capital funding is allocated over this same period for investment in Sustainable Urban Transport projects, and these will include projects that will provide either direct or indirect improvements for urban cycling.  Investment of more than &euro;750m on the Bus Connects Programme in the same period, will deliver a transformative investment package that will finance new and expanded bus routes, greatly improve bus access, and also includes the commencement of construction of core bus routes that include segregated cycle lanes and pedestrian footpath all which will greatly assist in encouraging modal shift.  My Department also spends over &euro;2.5m per annum on behavioural change programmes including Green Schools, Cycle Right and Smarter Travel Workplace and Campus programmes aimed at encouraging a modal shift.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware my Department has commenced a review of public transport policy &ldquo;to ensure services are sustainable into the future and are meeting the needs of a modern economy&rdquo;.  Work on this policy review is at an early stage and is currently drawing together data and information from many sources, including that discussed earlier, which will inform its work.  My Department will continue to monitor trends in modal shift in order to inform future policies in the context of encouraging further modal shift from the private car to sustainable public transport modes.</p></reply>

Phase one of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing campaign was rolled out in Britain in February and March and with phase two scheduled for September and October.</p>  <p>  Some 300 eye-catching billboard ads are highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way in key roadside and city centre locations across Britain right now. The ads feature strong and iconic images of various locations along the Wild Atlantic Way and the key message is the quick and easy access from Britain to those spectacular locations in under two hours. The campaign, which will reach at least ten million potential holidaymakers around Britain, is highlighting ease of direct access from six British gateway cities (London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow) to Cork, Kerry, Shannon, Knock, Donegal and City of Derry airports. An important element of this campaign is the co-operative advertising with airlines flying to airports close to the Wild Atlantic Way &ndash; highlighting good value offers and ease of access, helping to convert interest into business.</p>  <p>  While it is too early to report on the effectiveness of the campaign as yet, I look forward to hearing from the tourism agencies later in the year in this regard.</p></reply>

This higher demand is evidenced in the NTA&rsquo;s recent published Bus &amp;amp; Rail Statistics bulletin that shows a percentage growth of PSO passenger journeys in the Dublin Region at 21.1% and 23.4% for Dublin Bus and Luas respectively between 2013 and 2017. In 2017 alone Dublin Bus carried 136.26 million passenger journeys and Luas carried 37.65 million. While these figures are encouraging, they highlight why the major investment in public transport outlined in the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) 2018-2027 is needed to respond appropriately to this growth and to address the congestion problems of the Dublin region.</p>  <p>  A number of key investment priorities across the Dublin region are set out in the NDP which will address congestion in Dublin and capacity constraints on the existing public transport network. These projects include investing in the existing road, rail and bus network, BusConnects, MetroLink and priority elements of the DART Expansion Programme.  Planning of the large projects is now underway and they are scheduled for delivery progressively over the life-time of the 10-year NDP.  Meanwhile, in the shorter term, various measures and schemes are being taken to ensure more efficient functioning of transport within Dublin city centre;  these involve the National Transport Authority (NTA) working with local authorities and agencies and public transport operators. </p>  <p>  While the recently opened extension to the Luas Green Line is realising substantial benefits for customers and for Dublin, it has experienced a number of problems in its first few months of operations.  All parties have worked hard to overcome these problems including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have supported the smooth functioning of trams across key city centre junction by regularly patrolling it in peak periods.  I would also like to acknowledge the continual improvements Dublin City Council make to the signalised junctions on the shared-running sections of the Luas system and also on key bus routes in and out of the city. Such fine-tuning of the signals is an essential on-going support to the Bus and Luas system and traffic management in general. </p>  <p>  In relation to bus services, the 2017 performance by Dublin Bus was very strong and the company provided the largest annual number of passenger journeys in 2017 at approximately 136 million. This represents an increase of over 10% on 2016 and also represents five straight years of passenger growth. Against this backdrop 140 new buses are being purchased in 2018 for the Dublin Bus fleet to replace older buses and cater for market growth and new routes. This will bring the total fleet up to almost 1100 buses, with a further expansion of the fleet expected in 2019 in advance of the roll-out of BusConnects. Passengers will also see service improvements coming from bus market opening with, as recently announced, October 2018 seeing the commencement of an increase of service capacity of about 35% across the 24 routes involved.</p>  <p>  Looking to the medium term, the BusConnects Programme aims to transform the bus system in Dublin.  It will include: a full redesign of the bus network in order to provide a better and more efficient network for passengers; an expanded and modern fleet of vehicles;  new road infrastructure to facilitate bus priority and faster journeys for public transport users; improved passenger information and ticketing technology; and transition to a lower emission bus fleet.  The public will be fully informed by NTA about the BusConnects programme as it progresses and will have the opportunity to input at various stages to its development.  Over the coming weeks and months there will be number of informative stages.  Firstly, the NTA plans shortly to publish an information report about the 16 pathways that are emerging as the likely core bus corridors in and out of the city under the new investment Programme.  Secondly, the NTA will conduct a public consultation on redesign of Dublin's bus network, including proposals on a major redesign of routes, schedules and fare structures.  Thirdly, the NTA then plans to hold a public consultation on the emerging proposals for the 16 core bus corridors.</p>  <p>  Passenger numbers on Luas also increased (up 10.5% in 2017), which represents 3.6 million more passenger journeys compared to 2016.  The Luas Cross City extension boosted numbers using the Green Line by around 24% in January 2018 compared to January 2017.  This shows that demand for Green Line services has grown significantly, now that it has been extended to Broombridge and provides interchange with the Red Line and greater connectivity to mainline and DART rail services. As such, passenger numbers are likely to continue to grow in 2018 and beyond. </p>  <p>  Again looking to the future, a number of Luas related measured will be implemented to cater for this demand. A new timetable will be published in June to make best use of the new 55-metre trams that have been introduced with Luas Cross City and also a shuttle service between Heuston and Connolly. It is intended to add further additional Green Line Luas Capacity, by lengthening the 26 existing trams from 43m to 55m. The first extended tram will come online in late 2019, and the final by late 2021. Beyond that it is intended that a further 8 new 55m trams will be delivered and introduced into service. </p>  <p>  All the planned investment in public transport, short, medium and long-term, combined will add greatly to the level of service available for the travelling public, connecting more people with more places, easing congestion and combatting climate change.</p></reply>

This was opened in September 2010 with Park and Ride facilities for 1,200 at Pace and for 300 at Dunboyne. The plan for Phase 2 involved the extension of the Dunboyne Line between Clonsilla and M3 Parkway Station, onwards to north Navan. This development together with a number of other transport projects was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA), which has statutory responsibility for development of Public Transport in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), included an examination of the Navan to City Centre Rail Corridor in the preparation of its "Transport Strategy for the GDA for the period 2016-2035".  At that time the NTA concluded that, based on population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre was insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link.  Instead it proposed that an enhanced bus service would be provided along the corridor in conjunction with the development of a bus hub by the local authority in Navan.  This position will be kept under review by the NTA and will be reassessed as part of the next review of its GDA Transport Strategy which is due before the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently published Project Ireland 2040, comprising the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the National Development Plan (NDP), confirms a number of key public transport investment priorities. It also recognises that over the period of the plan it will be very important to examine the role that the interurban rail network can play in enhancing regional connectivity.  In this regard, the NDP notes that the NTA is required to review its Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy every six years and by the end of 2021.  This review will include a reappraisal of the proposed extension of the Dunboyne/M3 Parkway line to Navan taking into account the scale of new and planned development along the route, and this will allow for its consideration during the NDP Mid-Term Review.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Eastern &amp;amp; Midland Regional Assembly are currently preparing the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) for the Eastern and Midland Region, to ensure better co-ordination in planning and development policy matters across boundaries,  as provided for under the Local Government Reform Act 2014. The process of preparing the RSES for this region, that takes the high-level framework and principles of the NPF and works out more detail at regional and local authority levels, also involves consultation with a number of Stakeholders including the NTA.</p></reply>

I have not met with the Prime Minister formally since then, although we both attended the Informal EU Summit and High Level Conference on the Sahel in Brussels in February, the European Council in Brussels in March, and the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Sofia in May.  I recently wrote to Mr Orban on the occasion of his re-election, and wished him well in his role as Prime Minister of Hungary.</p>  <p>  I have not yet had an opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Conte of Italy, but I have written to congratulate him on his appointment and to wish him well in his new role.  I look forward to meeting him at the European Council in Brussels later this month. </p>  <p>  My bilateral engagement with EU and international counterparts is ongoing, and remains crucial in relation to Brexit and other important EU issues.  </p>  <p>  In this context, I look forward to meeting the new Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, in Madrid on Thursday 14 June. </p>  <p>  I am also scheduled to meet with the President of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, in Dublin on 21 June, and with the Austrian Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, in Dublin on 9 July.</p>  <p>  In addition to such scheduled bilateral meetings, I meet and speak regularly with my EU counterparts at formal and informal meetings of the European Council, where I use every opportunity to advance Ireland's interests.  I will of course attend the next meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 28 and 29 June.</p></reply>

This was published as a technical note on Thursday 7 June.</p><p>At my meeting with Prime Minister May I indicated that any move on customs that keeps the UK close to the EU is to be welcomed.</p><p>I indicated that we're willing to examine the UK proposal, but we need to see it presented as a formal written proposal in the Brexit negotiations process. </p><p>I also emphasised to the Prime Minister that upholding the commitment to avoid a hard border requires progress on more than just customs.</p><p>The agreed report from December makes clear that continued alignment on both single market and customs rules is necessary.  In many ways, the regulatory issues are even more important than customs here. </p><p>More generally, I made clear to the Prime Minister that Ireland would continue to insist on a legally operable backstop being in the Withdrawal Agreement.  This would be in line with the commitments made by the UK in December and repeated by the Prime Minister in her letter to Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, in March. </p><p>We now need to see concrete progress on the delivery of these commitments by the time of the June European Council. </p><p>I have been consistent in my message to both Prime Minister May and my fellow EU Heads of State and Government at the European Council that reintroduction of a border on the island of Ireland is not acceptable under any circumstances.</p><p>The Commission will make a first assessment of the technical and legal feasibility of the UK proposals, and whether they provide a basis for negotiation.  We look forward to its assessment and to discussing whether the proposals could be helpful in meeting the UK&rsquo;s repeated commitment to avoiding a hard border, and thereby making progress on the backstop on Ireland/Northern Ireland. </p><p>Based on the negotiations between the UK and the Commission Taskforce in the coming days and weeks, Mr Barnier will make an assessment of progress, for consideration by the European Council on 28 and 29 June.</p></reply>

This sets out detailed progress since May 2017 on commitments being implemented across Government and will be published shortly and laid before the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The report contains details of progress on commitments falling under the responsibility of the Department of the Taoiseach, mainly linked to Brexit preparations, the work of the Citizens' Assembly and continuing the process of D&aacute;il Reform and Seanad Reform.</p>  <p>  The Citizens' Assembly has considered each of the five topics and has published its recommendations to date on three of them.  These are, the Eighth amendment, responding to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population and making Ireland a leader in tackling climate change.    Government has published an indicative timetable for a number of referendums on constitutional amendments to be held in 2018 and 2019.  The first of these was a referendum on the Eighth amendment which was passed in May 2018. Referendums on blasphemy and &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s life within the home&rdquo; are next in line to be held. </p>  <p>  The new collaborative model is operating effectively in the Oireachtas with the Business Committee managing the weekly D&aacute;il business and the new Parliamentary Budget Office established to provide independent and impartial information, analysis and advice to the Oireachtas. The cross party group on Seanad Reform held its first meeting in May and the Taoiseach recently met with the chairpersons of Oireachtas Committees to discuss a wide range of issues relevant to their work.  </p>  <p>  The Department continues to support the Taoiseach to ensure the best possible outcomes for Ireland in relation to Brexit.  Earlier this week, Government launched the Global Ireland 2025 which represents the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s international presence ever undertaken in terms of diplomacy, culture, business, overseas aid, tourism and trade.    It will support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism, as Brexit becomes a reality.</p></reply>

Given the robust nature of military life and the unique physical and psychological demands it places on individuals, it is necessary that the members of the Defence Forces are physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations.  The State has a duty of care to ensure that each individual has the ability to perform the duties expected of them.</p>  <p>  Defence Force Regulation A.12 Medical Treatment (Paragraph 75) provides that all members of the Permanent Defence Force shall undergo an annual medical examination.  The Defence Forces have advised that some such examinations have occurred outside of the 12 month period but this has not been the case of any personnel over the age of 40 years.  In addition, it is necessary to ensure that both new entrants and those deploying overseas are given priority for medical examination.  There is no difference in the examination that is carried out before and after attaining the age of 40 years.  The outcome of a medical examination may lead to the medical re-classification of the individual concerned by a Medical Board.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to change provisions to age related medical examinations and gradings.</p></reply>

Defence Forces pay is increasing in line with recent public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  Members of the Defence Forces received increases in pay in 2017 under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  In addition, in a deal agreed with PDFORRA, improved payscales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for further increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement with the focus of the agreement once again being on the lower paid.  By the end of the agreement the payscales for all public servants (including members of the Permanent Defence Force) earning up to &euro;70,000, will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.  The restoration of cuts to allowances will also be considered in the context of the Agreement.  An increase of 1% on annualised salaries due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to members of the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  Following the series of pay increases in the last 12 months, a three star private on completion of training starts on &euro;27,257 (inclusive of military service allowance).  This represents an increase of 25% on the starting payscale of this rank in the last 12 months.  This starting pay compares very favourably with other entry level pay rates across the public service.  In addition to basic pay and military service allowance, a range of duties attract additional allowances.</p>  <p>  A newly commissioned officer starts on a salary in excess of &euro;35,000 per annum (inclusive of military service allowance), following 15 months training.  If officers are already graduates they start on a salary in excess of &euro;40,000 per annum (inclusive of military service allowance).  These rates of pay compare favourably with the average graduate salary across all sectors.</p>  <p>  There is an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation.  A number of initiatives have been instigated, including a review of the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force; a review of the criteria governing contracts for enlisted personnel and a review of skills gaps across the Defence Forces.  These measures address a range of issues and are aimed at ensuring that the Defence Forces retain the capabilities to undertake the roles assigned by Government. </p></reply>

The issue of housing and homelessness is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  My Department does not have a housing budget and does not provide homes or accommodation for retired personnel.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the valued public service given by former servicemen and women of the Defence Forces to the State.  As such, officials from my Department hold regular meetings with recognised veterans&rsquo; organisations including the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (O.N.E.), at which issues of concern to their members are discussed.  O.N.E. has enjoyed the long standing official recognition of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  As part of that process the Department has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with O.N.E.</p>  <p>  O.N.E. is dedicated to looking after the welfare of ex-service personnel of the Irish Defence Forces by way of providing accommodation to homeless, elderly or disabled members in need of such domestic accommodation and shelter and other assistance that may be required.  O.N.E. is a limited company with charitable status and has accommodation in Smithfield, Dublin (Br&uacute; na bhFiann with 30 places), Athlone (7 places), Letterkenny (7 places) a drop-in centre in Limerick, and an advice centre in Dundalk.</p>  <p>  Any retired soldier, male or female, may contact the Smithfield centre directly and O.N.E. will assist by directing the person to other facilities within the Health Services, the local authority services, or offer a room if vacant, in Dublin, Athlone or Letterkenny.</p>  <p>  I am aware that O.N.E. is proposing to increase the number of advice centres in other locations such as Cathal Brugha Barracks, McKee Barracks, Custume Barracks, Finner Camp, D&uacute;n U&Iacute; Mhaoliosa Barracks and Stephens Barracks.  My Department is currently working with O.N.E. in this regard.</p>  <p>  As a charitable organisation, I am aware that O.N.E. is heavily dependent on fundraising to finance its operation.  In this regard, under the terms of the SLA, and as part of the supports currently offered to veterans, my Department provides financial support by way of an annual subvention to O.N.E. to support and encourage its work.  This subvention is currently &euro;44,000 per annum.  The funding provided to O.N.E. by the Department of Defence is to support the general overheads of the organisation.  It is not for the provision of services that are provided to citizens, including members of O.N.E., from other arms of the State such as housing, health, social assistance, etc. Dublin City Council continues to support, on an ongoing basis, the O.N.E. homeless initiative in Smithfield.</p>  <p>  I have also committed to meeting the recognised veterans associations, including O.N.E., on an annual basis and I provide support by attendance at specific events whenever I can.  Later this month on the 27th June, I will be attending the launch of O.N.E.&rsquo;s annual Fuchsia fundraising appeal.  I am advised that Defence Forces units and installations throughout the country undertake fundraising in support of the work of O.N.E. on behalf of veterans.  The military authorities encourage such fundraising as an illustration of the solidarity and bonds that exists between veterans and serving personnel.</p>  <p>  The Defence Organisation and I are committed to continued engagement with O.N.E. into the future.</p></reply>

This programme has seen the delivery of three new naval Service vessels since 2014.  The L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was commissioned in May 2014, L&Eacute; James Joyce was commissioned in September 2015 and L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats was commissioned into service in October 2016.</p>  <p>  In June 2016, a contract for an additional sister ship was agreed at a cost of &euro;54.3m, bringing investment in the new ships programme to some &euro;250 million since 2010.  The build of the fourth ship, to be named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, is progressing well at Babcock Marine Appledore in the UK.  The ship is scheduled to undergo Sea Acceptance Trials (SAT) in mid July 2018, and the delivery date of the ship will be confirmed on the successful completion of the SAT.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV).  It is the Government&rsquo;s intent that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks, both at home and overseas.  Planning has commenced on this project and it is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course for the supply of the MRV.  This, of course, is subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope.  The cost of the MRV will only be know once the tender competition is concluded.</p>  <p>  The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with an ongoing maintenance regime for all vessels within the fleet, will ensure that the operational capabilities of the Naval Service, as the State&rsquo;s principal seagoing agency, are maintained to the greatest extent.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it was discussed by Ministers in informal format over lunch.</p>  <p>  Many Ministers expressed their deep concern at the disproportionate use of force by Israel, and the appalling number of casualties.  These concerns had already been expressed in EU and national statements, and at the UN Human Rights Council, where Ireland and others supported a successful resolution which will, inter alia, establish a commission of inquiry into these events.</p>  <p>  In my intervention I also argued strongly that events such as these will only recur if the vicious cycle in Gaza is not broken.  It was essential not to despair of progress in Gaza but instead to redouble our efforts to find practical ways to begin to ease the situation there, and to provide hope.  The inhabitants of Gaza must be able to see a political and economic perspective to end the blockade and end their isolation, otherwise more militant voices and groups will inevitably be strengthened. </p>  <p>  The meeting also discussed humanitarian assistance, the difficult position of UNRWA, the recent move of the United States Embassy, and the prospects for a peace initiative by the US.</p></reply>

A further &euro;207 million is being managed through other Government Departments and through Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.  </p>  <p>  As an integral component of the overall financial management and control of the aid programme, Irish Aid operates a comprehensive budgeting system.  Clear criteria are in place to inform the budget allocation process.  Following a period of extensive discussion and analysis a detailed budget allocation for the 2018 programme was approved by an inter-Departmental committee, enabling Ireland to respond to existing needs, ongoing humanitarian crises and overall priorities as defined in the &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo; document.  </p>  <p>  Sub-Saharan Africa remains our priority region, where we direct assistance to the poorest communities, particularly but not exclusively in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Ireland also engages in Vietnam and neighbouring countries.  In addition to development assistance, Ireland leads in humanitarian response, including to the ongoing Syria crisis and also to the situation in the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as to emergencies as they arise.</p>  <p>  Our programme is delivered through a wide range of partners and channels, including partner government systems, Irish and international Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and missionary organisations, the EU, and the UN and other multilateral agencies and organisations.  We continue to engage with UN and multilateral agencies whose core mission and objectives are closely aligned to Ireland&rsquo;s aid priorities, allowing us to work with and support vulnerable communities across most developing countries.</p>  <p>  As at the end of May 2018, my Department has disbursed almost &euro;150 million of the 2018 allocated funding to a wide variety of partners and programme areas in line with robust and prudent grant management procedures.   I am confident of a full disbursement by the year end as we deliver on our commitment in the fight against poverty and hunger, continue to bring real and sustainable improvements some of the world&rsquo;s poorest communities and increase our response to the unprecedented level of humanitarian needs worldwide.</p></reply>

Given the complexity of operation in a conflict zone, Ireland&rsquo;s assistance inside Syria is channelled through the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.  It is recognised that provision of humanitarian aid to areas in conflict, including Syria, presents significant challenges, particularly when it comes to the political and security environment.  Ireland&rsquo;s partners working in such environments are therefore subject to careful systems assessments and must demonstrate transparency, accountability, and effective and efficient use of funds.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the standard robust grant management and appraisals processes, a dedicated Humanitarian Advisor for the Middle East, based in the Irish Embassy in Ankara, also oversees programmes and partners in receipt of Irish funding.  This includes membership of donor advisory boards, based in the region, who oversee the allocation of support to various partners.  In addition, Ireland participates in international donor coordination mechanisms that monitor and oversee the work of our partners.  Through Ireland&rsquo;s upcoming chairmanship of the OCHA Donor Support Group, in particular, we will support OCHA to lead an effective and principled global humanitarian response, including inside Syria.  </p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response inside Syria.  Implementation of humanitarian aid managed by the EU is ensured through several layers of checks and monitoring, including regular field visits.  Regular evaluations are also undertaken, the results of which are publicly available.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor closely the humanitarian situation across the region affected by the Syria crisis.  We will also continue to ensure that Irish and EU assistance reaches those in greatest need in the most efficient and effective way possible, with robust monitoring mechanisms in place to ensure this.</p></reply>

The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, including through use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques, forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering, denial of humanitarian assistance and deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals, including chemical attacks. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports EU restrictive measures (sanctions) targeting the Assad regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as repression continues.  The sanctions currently in place include notably an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression as well as on equipment and technology for monitoring or interception of internet or telephone communications.  In addition, over 250 persons and almost 70 entities are targeted by a travel ban and an asset freeze over the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.  Most recently, in March, the Council added an additional 4 persons to the list of those targeted by EU restrictive measures against the Syrian regime for their role in the development and use of chemical weapons against the civilian population.  On 28 May 2018, the Council extended EU restrictive measures against the Syrian regime until 1 June 2019.  Given the ongoing repression of the civilian population, the EU decided to maintain its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters, in line with the EU strategy on Syria.   </p>  <p>  EU Regulations have what is termed "direct effect" in Irish law, meaning that they apply and must be complied with in the same way as Irish legislation.  In Ireland, penalties for breaches of sanctions are provided for by Statutory Instrument (SIs).  A comprehensive list of SIs may be found in the Irish Statute Book.  Within the EU each Member State is required to designate Competent Authorities that are engaged with sanctions issues including ensuring that sanctions measures are implemented.  In Ireland's case, there are three such Competent Authorities: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade represents Ireland internationally on sanctions-related matters, including communicating with the EU, the UN and other states in respect of international restrictive measures.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is the Competent Authority for implementation of trade-related sanctions and the Central Bank of Ireland is the Competent Authority for the implementation of financial sanctions as they relate to financial institutions.  Given the multi-sectoral nature of sanctions measures however a wide range of Government stakeholders are engaged on sanctions related issues.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support all efforts to ensure a lasting peace and full accountability for war crimes in Syria, in the context of bringing peace and stability to the region.</p></reply>

The conflict has cost the lives of well over 400,000 people, 13 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance, over 6 million people are displaced within Syria and an additional 5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  There have been numerous brutal attacks on civilians by the Assad regime and others, including the use of medieval starve or surrender tactics, the use of chemical weapons and the deliberate targeting of medical facilities and personnel.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports a broad range of efforts to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria as part of a sustainable peaceful resolution to the conflict and has consistently called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court.  Ireland supports the work of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry established in August 2011 by the Human Rights Council to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in Syria.  Furthermore, in December 2016 Ireland and a group of like-minded countries successfully pressed for the adoption of a resolution by the UN General Assembly to establish an International Impartial and Independent Mechanism to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria.  Last year my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charlie Flanagan T.D. announced a contribution of &euro;100,000 to support the work of this mechanism.  Further support for the work of the Mechanism in 2018 is currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also a strong and consistent supporter of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whose Fact Finding Mission (FFM) was set up in 2014 to &ldquo;establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic&rdquo;.  We support their work financially with annual contributions amounting to nearly &euro;1million since 2014.  In addition, Ireland contributed &euro;200,000 specifically to the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mission to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria. </p>  <p>  Ireland deeply regrets Russia&rsquo;s veto of the renewal of the mandate of this Joint Investigative Mission last October. It is extremely frustrating that the UN Security Council has not been able to take meaningful action to maintain peace and security in Syria and to ensure accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  Those who have vetoed effective UN action in this regard bear a heavy responsibility.</p>  <p>  Ireland is supporting an initiative to convene a Special Conference of States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention with a view to considering the introduction of a mechanism for attributing responsibility for the use of chemical weapons.  </p>  <p>  Ireland also supports EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as repression continues.  The sanctions currently in place include notably an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression as well as on equipment and technology for monitoring or interception of internet or telephone communications. In addition, over 250 persons and almost 70 entities are targeted by a travel ban and an asset freeze over the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.  Most recently, in March, the Council added an additional 4 persons to the list of those targeted by EU restrictive measures against the Syrian regime for their role in the development and use of chemical weapons against the civilian population.

Given the ongoing repression of the civilian population, the EU decided to maintain its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters, in line with the EU strategy on Syria.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also supported calls for sanctions at UN level also and very much regrets that a draft UN Security Council resolution that would have established a sanctions regime, a committee and an expert panel to hold accountable those using and producing chemical weapons in Syria was not passed in February 2017.  Ireland will continue to support all efforts to ensure a lasting peace and full accountability for war crimes in Syria, in the context of bringing peace and stability to the region.</p></reply>

The current President of the HRC will now take this forward.</p>  <p>  Israeli Ministers have responded with public statements indicating that they refuse to recognise the inquiry, and will not co-operate with it.

I and other EU Ministers have acknowledged Israel&rsquo;s right to defend itself, while at the same time making strong criticisms of what we saw as its excessive and unjustified use of force in this instance.  Israel has claimed to have been engaged in legitimate self-defence, but its refusal to cooperate with scrutiny of that claim, and to explain and justify its actions, sends an unfortunate signal.  The need for an international inquiry arose, in part, due to the fact that Israel did not conduct a comprehensive review of the use of deadly force on previous occasions.</p></reply>

I stated that the decision was premature and ill-advised, and would be unhelpful to efforts to reach a resolution of the Middle East Peace Process, something which is very urgently needed.  Indeed prior to this announcement, I had conveyed to the US Government my concern about reports of their intentions.  Very many other governments around the world, including those like us which are long-standing friends of the United States, did the same.  The announcement, when it was made, was thus very disappointing and difficult to understand.</p>  <p>  These views have also been expressed in statements at EU level, and in direct contacts with US officials, by myself and officers of my Department.  The US Government can be in no doubt about our view on this question.</p>  <p>  Ireland looks forward in due course to establishing Embassies in Jerusalem to both Israel and the future Palestinian state, following the conclusion of a peace agreement and in accordance with international law.  Until then, our Embassy to Israel will remain in Tel Aviv.</p>  <p>  Efforts to restart the Middle East peace process are currently centred on the initiative being developed by the United States.  The US move on Jerusalem has unfortunately made this initiative more difficult, but I believe that it is essential that these efforts persist. I have spoken at the Foreign Affairs Council to urge EU partners to engage with the US to encourage this initiative and to seek to shape it and ensure that it is in line with the key parameters for a settlement.  I have myself spoken with the US Middle East team a number of times in this regard.  I also spoke with Israeli and Palestinian leaders last week on this issue.</p></reply>

I, and officials in my Department, have been monitoring the state of affairs in Yemen with growing anxiety, particularly in recent months as the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.  After three years of war, three quarters of the population are estimated to require some form of humanitarian assistance.  The situation is already untenable.  I am particularly troubled by reports of growing tensions around the port of Hodeidah.  About 80% of Yemen&rsquo;s humanitarian and commercial aid runs through this port and any interruption of this flow would lead to further suffering for civilians in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Humanitarian access is a critical issue, and I have consistently called on all parties to the conflict to ensure that the people of Yemen receive the assistance they urgently need. Commercial access is equally important, since a population of over 20 million people cannot survive on aid alone.  Officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin late last year and again last month and relayed my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access.  The EU has also made representations to Saudi Arabia on this issue.</p>  <p>  The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget. Ireland has provided &euro;15.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, including &euro;4million in assistance which was announced in March this year.  Ireland also provides global funding to a number of organisations which are particularly active in Yemen including the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). </p>  <p>  Ireland has also worked in the UN system to raise our grave concerns about human rights in Yemen.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen.  The resolution established a group of international experts to examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.</p>  <p>  The EU has worked to keep communication channels open with all stakeholders and regional actors in Yemen.  At the Foreign Affairs Council in December last year, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, and I will continue to raise these concerns with all appropriate interlocutors whenever possible.</p>  <p>  The EU supports the work of Martin Griffiths, the new Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Yemen, and his team, and in particular his efforts to prepare a framework for negotiations to present to the UN Security Council in June. We hope that peace negotiations can be re-launched shortly afterwards.  I believe that the new envoy will be able to engage all parties to the conflict to come back to the negotiating table, in order to achieve a sustainable solution for the people of Yemen.  My EU colleagues and I are committed to supporting his work, and would be happy to meet with him at the Foreign Affairs Council to hear how we can best do that.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.  I believe that only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict, and the EU stands ready to support this.</p></reply>

The devolved, power-sharing institutions are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement and are the best means for achieving accountable, representative decision-making for all the people of Northern Ireland.   Unfortunately, to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive engagement.  In light of this, the Government has been working with the British Government to consider means by which we can support the political process, in accordance with the Agreement, in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken with Prime Minister May and emphasised the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p>  <p>  I am in very regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, as we seek a way beyond the current impasse.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State and I have each conducted a round of contacts with the Northern Ireland political parties to hear their views on how, at this stage, the two Governments can support the political process, in accordance with the Agreement.</p>  <p>  All parties have re-affirmed their commitment to operating the devolved institutions and provided views on their key concerns and issues to be addressed in seeking a way forward.</p>  <p>  In light of these consultations, the Secretary of State and I will consider how best the two Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, can chart a way forward that will give the best prospects for getting the devolved institutions operating again without delay.</p>  <p>  I will continue to engage intensively, working with Secretary of State Bradley and the leaders of all of the political parties, until that is achieved.</p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is the indispensable framework for providing stable, inclusive, power-sharing government for all the people of Northern Ireland and for sustaining our interlocking relationships &ndash; within Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland and between the UK and Ireland.</p></reply>

In order to respond to anticipated application increases and to seasonal demands, the Passport Service received sanction for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) this year to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  These TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels.</p>  <p>  The demand for passports is 7% higher at this period, in comparison to the same period last year.  The Passport Service is meeting its target turnaround times for certain categories of applicants, and I acknowledge that there are delays in other categories.   For applicants that have used the Online Passport Application service, the target turnaround timeframe of 10 working days (plus postage) is being met and in 50% of cases, applications are being processed in 5 working days (plus postage).  The target timeframe of 15 working days for Passport Express renewals is also currently being met.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service acknowledges that for certain categories such as first time applicants and applicants with lost or stolen passports, processing is taking longer due to additional security checks.  The Passport Service is doing everything possible to ensure that passports are processed as quickly as possible. In addition to the intake of TCOs, staff from other Divisions in the Department have been reassigned to assist with enquiries, and targeted overtime is available.</p>  <p>  A central element of my Department&rsquo;s approach to managing increasing application volumes has been the implementation of service improvements in order to minimise the impact unusually high application volumes have on turnaround times.  The Passport Reform Programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.  The online passport application service, which was launched last year, will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of exceptionally high volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service.  I would encourage all applicants wherever possible to renew their passports using the online renewal service.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is satisfied that the combination of delivery upgrades to the technology platforms and application process, together with the recruitment of adequate TCOs and reallocation of resources from other divisions on a temporary basis, will meet the demand during peak season.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out statutory requirements for mortgage lenders and credit servicing firms dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears on the mortgage loan secured by their primary residence.</p><p>Lenders must ensure that the case of each borrower is individually assessed on its merits to ensure fairness.  The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) framework sets out the steps which lenders must follow.  A lender must carry out affordability assessments by examining each case on its own merits and must base its assessment of the borrower's full circumstances including their ability to pay as determined by up to date information on a Standard Financial Statement (SFS).</p><p>A lender must explore all options for alternative repayment arrangements (that they offer) in order to offer the most viable solution to each borrower.  The Code also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.  The lender is also obliged to carry out a review of an alternative repayment arrangement at any time, if requested by the borrower.</p><p>It may not be possible for your constituent and their lender to agree on an alternative repayment arrangement. If the lender is not willing to offer your constituent an alternative repayment arrangement, they must give the reasons in writing.  If they do offer an arrangement, your constituent may choose not to accept it.  If your constituent is not happy with the lender&rsquo;s treatment of their case, or if they feel the lender has not complied with the CCMA, they can appeal to the lender under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012.  If they remain unsatisfied with the outcome of an appeal or complaint, they can refer to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).</p><p>The FSPO have developed an extensive guide for complainants which can be found at <i></i></p><p>As the Deputy is aware, notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, the Minister has no direct function in the relationship between AIB/EBS and its customers.  The Minister must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial and independent basis. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for the Minister to intervene in the case of any particular customer. </p><p>However, I have received the following response from AIB:</p><p>&quot;AIB Group (including EBS) has a dedicated unit established specifically to work with customers in financial difficulty. Customers, who are in arrears on their family home, are requested to provide a Standard Financial Statement together with supporting documents.  The case is then assessed by a dedicated portfolio manager who is trained specifically to deal with customers in financial difficulty.</p><p>The Bank offers a number of long term solutions (some of which are unique to AIB Group). Solutions are offered to customers based on their affordability. The primary objective of AIB Group is to work with customers in difficulty and, wherever possible, agree a sustainable solution that enables them to stay in their family home.</p><p>The Bank has also established relationships with third parties, for example IMHO and MABS, in order to provide every opportunity for customers in financial difficulty to engage with the Bank to try to agree a sustainable long term solution.</p><p>In summary, AIB Group&rsquo;s objective is to prioritise the customers&rsquo; family home and where possible agree a long term sustainable solution that enables families to stay in their home.&quot;</p></reply>

Since then, the Working Group, now chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., has published two reports examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance for motorists and the cost of employer and public liability insurance for businesses.  These Reports identified and made recommendations on short, medium and long-term measures to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.</p>  <p>  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance   was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.</p>  <p>  In its second phase, the Working Group examined the cost of business insurance, in particular employer liability insurance and public liability insurance.  This work culminated in the publication of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance   on 25 January 2018.  The Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations from the two Reports by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within each that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.</p>  <p>  The fifth such update was published on 11 May 2018 and is the first to detail the implementation of both primary Reports.  It shows that, in relation to the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met, while substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  Meanwhile, all eight actions due during Q1 2018 from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance   have been completed on time.</p>  <p>  Both of the primary Reports and all of the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within "The Cost of Insurance Working Group" sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for May 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While it is accepted that motor insurance premiums are still at a very high level for many people, such statistics indicate at least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis.</p>  <p>  The Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the two primary Reports.  The cumulative effects of the completion of the two reports&rsquo; recommendations, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market without unnecessary delay.</p></reply>

Where other qualifying conditions are satisfied, stamp duty will only be paid to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold.  A reduced rate of 1% will be charged on the excess, if any, of the purchase value. If the sale takes place before the purchase, then relief will be given at the time of purchase.  However, if the purchase takes place first, then stamp duty will have to be paid but can subsequently be refunded when the sale takes place.</p><p>A number of qualifying conditions must be satisfied before the relief can apply.  The most important condition is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase or an exchange of farmland was made for farm consolidation purposes.  This is the certificate that is currently required in relation to the capital gains tax relief.  The criteria to be used by Teagasc for this purpose and the information to be supplied to Teagasc are contained in guidelines published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine:</p><p>(<i></i>).</p><p>A purchaser of farmland must retain ownership of the farmland for a period of five years and must use the land for farming.  Where any part of the land is disposed of before the end of this five-year holding period, the stamp duty relieved can subsequently be recovered by Revenue, or partly recovered as appropriate.</p><p>The measure will apply to all transactions which took place on or after 01 January 2018, so farmers who consolidate their holdings prior to the commencement of the relief will still be eligible.</p><p>I hope to be able to sign a commencement order for this measure shortly.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that the Central Bank of Ireland does not have any regulatory role in relation to this matter either.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, examined the issue of the discretion of the court to exercise in favour of the winning party - the &lsquo;costs follow the event&rsquo; principle, as part of its examination of the cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  This was as a result of business stakeholders expressing frustration at the lack of consistency in the application of this general principle where a claim is dismissed and the insurer is still required to meet its own costs.  It was argued by such stakeholders that failure to follow this principle meant that these costs were ultimately reflected in an increase in the premium of policyholders, even though the claim had been found to have no basis.  </p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group, in its report, acknowledged that the determination of who is to pay costs is ultimately at the discretion of the judge in any given case on the basis of the relevant facts, and that in certain cases costs not following the event can be appropriate, for example, in cases involving the State where an important legal principle has been raised.  However, there was a view expressed that inconsistency in the application of this principle may lead insurers to settle an otherwise defendable case, unilaterally, or in consultation with the policyholder, solely because that strategy is more cost efficient than successfully defending an action, and  not being able to recover their costs.</p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group believes that a consistent application of the &lsquo;costs follow the event&rsquo; principle &ndash; recognising that it should remain a matter for the independent judiciary to be the key decision makers in this regard &ndash; would probably be one of the most effective ways of tackling fraud and exaggerated claims, as it would give insurers the confidence to challenge more robustly cases which they have doubts about.  It would also remove the common reason expressed by insurers that uncertainty in relation to legal costs forces them to settle regularly on the court steps rather than to dispute a case  in court.  In addition, it would mean that the minority of plaintiffs who seek to exploit the system through fraud or exaggeration would have to think more carefully about the consequences for themselves, should they lose the case.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group believes that such an approach should have no bearing or impact on plaintiffs who have a deserving case, and genuinely feel it needs to be settled in court.</p>  <p>Finally, I understand that the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 , which my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan TD, has responsibility for, makes extensive provision for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  Section 169 of the Act puts the general principle of &lsquo;costs follow the event&rsquo; on a statutory footing.  I understand that this section will become operational once the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator is established, which is currently projected for Q3 of 2018 and as Minister for Finance, I welcome this.</p></reply>

As a result, the majority of social welfare payments are deemed as taxable for income tax purposes.  Consistent with this approach, the charge to income tax on Maternity Benefit payments applies to ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.</p>  <p>  The extent to which taxation actually arises, if at all, in a given case depends on the total level of income that the individual or couple concerned has in the relevant period.  In circumstances where the Maternity Benefit is paid in lower income households, such mothers will likely not have to pay any income tax as their tax liability would not be higher than the amount sheltered by their personal tax credits.  This is most likely to be the case in circumstances where social welfare payments are the only source of income for a household.</p>  <p>  In addition, recognising that such payments have an important purpose to support women on Maternity Leave from work, Maternity Benefit payments are exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.</p></reply>

At the time this provision was expected to yield &euro;3 million to the Exchequer in 2011 and &euro;5 million in a full year. </p><p>Since 2011, professional membership fees are only deductible under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 where they are incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily by an individual in the performance of the duties of his or her employment.  In the context of professional fees, this generally means where:</p><p>- the duties of his or her employment necessitate that the employee is a member of a professional body, or holds a practicing certificate or licence, and</p><p>- the employee cannot exercise those duties without that membership or certificate</p><p>Where such fees are not reimbursed by the employer then the employee concerned can claim the appropriate tax relief.  I am advised by Revenue that the information on tax returns relating to claims for expenses does not separately distinguish professional membership fees from other allowable deductions.  It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the cost or yield related to any specific expense type and so it is not possible to give an exact figure for the annual cost of the relief in its present form.  The Tax Expenditures Report 2017 published by my Department includes an estimated cost at &euro;3.75 million per annum. </p><p>However I would stress that the figures above cited are very much estimates.  The cost in any given year would obviously depend on a number of variables.  These include the total of taxpayers claiming and the cost of the subscriptions or fees involved and Revenue do not hold separate data on these. </p><p>The Deputy may also be interested in the numbers and tax cost associated with all types of &lsquo;Allowable Expenses&rsquo;, details of which are given in Revenue&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cost of Tax Expenditures&rsquo; publication available at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The transport of passengers is exempt from VAT under Irish VAT law and bus operators are exempt from VAT on the supply of transport in this respect.  Where a service is exempt under VAT law this means that the supplier of the service does not charge VAT on the supply but it also means that they are not entitled to claim VAT on any business-related expenditure.  Only businesses registered for VAT who make taxable supplies are entitled to claim back VAT incurred on their inputs.</p>  <p>  Historically Ireland operates a VAT refund order whereby persons not registered for VAT can reclaim VAT paid on touring coaches in set circumstances.  However, spare parts of buses and coaches are not included under this refund order.  Because the refund order historically derogates from normal VAT rules, it is not possible under EU VAT law to extend this refund order to bus and coach parts.</p></reply>

At the end of 2017, it completed its work on the development of this Scheme and on 19 December 2017, the Government approved the General Scheme of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill is included in the Government Legislative Programme on the list of Priority Legislation for publication this session.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach indicated to me in February that it would not be conducting pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill.  </p>  <p>  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel assigned a drafter to the Bill on 26 January 2018 and officials in the Department of Finance are currently working with the drafter to finalise a draft of the Bill as soon as possible.  I am hopeful that the Bill will be published in the coming weeks.  A consultation will also have to take place with the European Central Bank on the Bill once it is published.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it will take a certain amount of time following publication of the Bill, for it to pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas. However I am hopeful that with the cooperation of all parties in the Houses, it can be considered and approved expeditiously and thus meet yours and others wishes to have the database in place as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Due to the manner in which data are recorded on Revenue systems, it is not possible to report on the tax paid by those in receipt of both occupational pensions and other sources of income.  Nor can the tax paid on income from other, non-social welfare pensions be separately identified.</p>  <p>  In relation to [Question 24875/18], I am advised by Revenue that income from social welfare pensions is not separately recorded on tax returns and is amalgamated with income from other sources in the calculation of tax liabilities.  As such, it is not possible to report on the tax paid in respect of social protection pensions. In addition, it is important to note that while in general all income arising from social welfare pensions is liable to Income Tax (though not Universal Social Charge), in most cases an individual solely in receipt of a social welfare pension will be below the threshold to pay tax, after tax credits are taken into account.</p></reply>

These requirements relate to, <i>inter alia</i>, initial capital, the suitability of shareholders and members, the programme of operations and structural organisation, and the corporate characteristics of the applicant.  Under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the European Central Bank (ECB) has exclusive competence for granting licences.  Pursuant to section 9 of the Central Bank Act 1971, the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s role is to propose decisions to the ECB to grant licences.  In the absence of all relevant information and the completion of the full assessment of an application in the normal course, the Central Bank is not in a position to provide any views on potential decisions that may be made in this context.  </p><p>The prohibition on accepting deposits from members of the public without a banking licence does not apply to local authorities by virtue of section 7(4)(f) of the Central Bank Act 1971 (provided that this activity is subject to regulations and controls intended to protect depositors and investors).  However, this exemption does not appear to preclude an application for a banking licence by a local authority. In addition, notwithstanding any exemption from an obligation to hold a banking licence in order to engage in deposit-taking such person may still require an authorisation to engage in lending to retail consumers, e.g. a retail credit firm authorisation under Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997.</p><p>Regarding the remit of local authorities, the statutory role and responsibilities assigned to local authorities are as provided for in legislation and overall policy responsibility for such matters are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Nevertheless, in relation to mortgage lending, the Deputy will note that, under section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, a local authority, subject to regulations made by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may make loans for the purpose of acquiring or constructing of houses. </p><p>Under the powers conferred by this provision, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Mr Eoghan Murphy T.D. launched the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme earlier this year. It was set up in accordance with the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018, which set out the criteria for local authorities to issue loans and the eligibility to avail of loans under the Scheme.  </p><p>The Scheme which replaced the Home Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan Schemes, enables credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. </p><p>The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers who have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home from a commercial lender.  The Scheme is operated by the local authorities with support from the Housing Agency, which carries out assessments of applications on behalf of the authorities. </p><p>At the end of May 2018, the Agency had received approximately 1,500 applications for assessment from the local authorities.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is confident that the Scheme is working well and will achieve its objective of providing loans to people who meet the criteria set out in the Regulations.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  </p>  <p>  In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers will use a combination of rating factors, which include how the vehicle is used, as well as the age and type of the vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, and the number of drivers.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to particular categories, different insurance companies will have different views.</p>  <p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years with a related problem, as referred to in the PQ, being the availability of cover in the first place.  These issues were the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The fifth such update was published on 11 May and shows that of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  Both the Report and the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for May 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore I appreciate many people may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that the improved stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.  In addition, with the full implementation of the Motor Report, I believe that Ireland will be more attractive to new entrants thus increasing capacity as well as competition which should have a positive impact in niche areas such as motor insurance for musicians.  </p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, he/she may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.  Under the terms of the DCA, which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website, while more generally, Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  The relevant contact details are: feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

These measures seek to ensure that lenders act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of their customers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; for example, through protections at the initial marketing and advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties during the course of the credit agreement.</p>  <p>   For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, provides that lenders must act honestly, fairly, transparently and professionally, taking account of the rights and interests of the consumer, in relation to the provision of mortgage credit.  In particular, lenders must assess the creditworthiness of consumers (which must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate) and that assessment shall take account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations having regard to the terms of the proposed credit agreement.  Furthermore, it provides that the lender shall only make mortgage credit available where the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer's obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under the agreement.  In addition, the European Banking Authority has published Guidelines on Creditworthiness Assessment which provides additional detail on the creditworthiness requirements of the Mortgage Credit Directive which indicates, in guideline 4.3, that if the mortgage loan term extends past the consumer's expected retirement age, the lender should take appropriate account of the adequacy of the consumer's likely income and ability to continue meet obligations under the credit agreement in retirement.  Furthermore, where advisory services are being provided in relation to mortgage credit, the Regulations provide that it will be necessary to obtain information regarding the consumer&rsquo;s personal and financial situation, preferences and objectives and that any assessment shall take into account reasonable assumptions as to risks to the consumer's situation over the term of the proposed credit agreement.</p>  <p>  Also, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower, including the age of the borrower.  In particular, a regulated entity must gather and record sufficient information from the consumer prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a product or service appropriate to that consumer. The level of information gathered should be appropriate to the nature and complexity of the product or service being sought by the consumer, but must be to a level that allows the regulated entity to provide a professional service and must include details of the consumer&rsquo;s needs and objectives, personal circumstances (including age where relevant) and their financial situation.  Also, prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a credit product to a personal consumer, a lender must carry out an assessment of affordability to ascertain the consumer&rsquo;s likely ability to repay the debt, over the duration of the agreement. A regulated entity must take account of the result of the affordability assessment when deciding whether a personal consumer is likely to be able to repay the debt for that amount and duration in the manner required under the credit agreement.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Code, when assessing the suitability of a product or service for a consumer, the regulated entity must, at a minimum, consider and document whether, on the basis of the information gathered:</p>  <p>  - the product or service meets that consumer&rsquo;s needs and objectives;</p>  <p>  - the consumer is likely to be able to meet the financial commitment associated with the product on an ongoing basis and is financially able to bear any risks attaching to the product or service;</p>  <p>  - the consumer has the ability to repay the debt in the manner required under the credit agreement, on the basis of the outcome of the assessment of affordability; and</p>  <p>  - the product or service is consistent with the consumer&rsquo;s attitude to risk.</p>  <p>  However, subject to complying with relevant consumer protection and other regulatory/macro prudential requirements, it is then a matter for individual lenders to set their own lending policies and to make their own commercial decisions on individual mortgage or other credit applications.</p></reply>

My Department has subsequently received confirmation from the Office of the Attorney General that there are no state-aid or other legal issues with this decision, and therefore an additional provision to give effect to it has been included in the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, which has now been finalised in liaison with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. </p><p>I obtained Government approval last week to proceed with publication of this Bill.  I am hoping that, with the cooperation of Members of the House, the Bill will pass all Stages in an efficient manner.

The same principle of full payment will apply to third party <i>property</i>motor insurance claimants subject to a limit of &euro;1.22m (in line with Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland limits).</p><p>It is however important to note that only claims which have been settled can be included in applications to the High Court for payment from the ICF.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.  It is hoped that by the State taking steps to ensure that third party claimants are compensated in full, this will continue to encourage the settlement of all outstanding claims as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

All such errors, including those related to mortgage accounts, are thoroughly analysed and monitored by the Central Bank to ensure that they are fully resolved, with customers notified and refunded promptly, systems&rsquo; failures corrected and controls implemented to prevent a recurrence of the error.  The Central Bank considers each error on its own merits, with the overarching objective of protecting consumers&rsquo; interests, including ensuring that they are not left out of pocket.</p>  <p>  While the Central Bank cannot comment on individual interactions with regulated entities it can confirm that, as required by the Central Bank&rsquo;s statutory Consumer Protection Code, it was notified by the particular bank referred to by the Deputy of a substantial under-collection error.  The bank confirmed that the error affected approximately 1,300 accounts with a total of approximately &euro;41 million under collected from customers.  The error was as a result of a failure to move customers to full capital and interest payments after the initial interest only period on their mortgage expired.  A number of repayment options were afforded to customers at that time.  This error was monitored by the Central Bank to its resolution.  However, any customer who is not satisfied with how they were treated by the bank continue to be entitled to make a complaint to the particular institution regarding the error.  However, if the customer is not satisfied by the outcome at that level then they can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) has also advised that section 72 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, gave the FSPO the power to publish reports identifying regulated financial service providers who have had at least three complaints against them substantiated or partly substantiated.

A "credit intermediary" is defined as "a person who in the course of his business arranges or offers to arrange for a consumer the provision of credit or the letting of goods in return for a commission, payment or consideration of any kind from the provider of the credit or the owner, as the case may be".  The CCPC provides licenses to credit intermediaries and keeps an online list of credit intermediaries holding a valid authorisation which is available on the CCPC website www.ccpc.ie.</p>  <p>  The CCPC also deals with complaints about the advertising of Credit Agreements, issuing Pawnbrokers licenses and the advertising of car finance on credit intermediary websites and in the media.  The CCPC&rsquo;s remit is limited to authorisation, as opposed to having a regulatory role for PCPs.  It also has a specific statutory remit to provide personal finance information and education to assist consumers.</p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman can also investigate complaints from individual consumers about credit intermediaries.</p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection Code does not apply to hire purchase and consumer hire agreements.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the recent publications by the Central Bank and the CCPC on Personal Contract Plans which are a form of hire purchase.  My Department is examining these publications and will give careful consideration to what further actions, including consumer protection measures, if any would be appropriate in the light of those reports.</p></reply>

The proposed rate on exchanges of shares was 0.1% and the proposed rate for derivative transactions was 0.01%.  The tax would be levied on financial institutions &ndash; non-financial institutions would not be covered.</p>  <p>  Ireland currently has a tax on financial transactions, a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%.  In 2017 this stamp raised &euro;428 million (&euro;389 million in 2016).</p>  <p>  The report &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; which was published in October 2016 in conjunction with Budget 2017, committed the Department of Finance to conduct a review of stamp duty on share transactions in 2017.</p>  <p>  Following from this, the Department of Finance launched a review and associated public consultation under the title &lsquo;Review of the Application of Stamp Duty to Stocks and Marketable Securities of Irish Incorporated Companies&rsquo; in September 2017.</p>  <p>  A report on the outcome of this review and public consultation is currently being prepared for my consideration in advance of Budget 2019.</p>  <p>  In relation to discussions at EU level, the Government's position is that an FTT would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres to prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government previously indicated that it did not wish to stand in the way of EU Member states that wish to work together to implement an FTT and in this regard adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced cooperation took place during the Irish Presidency of the EU in January 2013.</p>  <p>  The proposal for a Directive from the European Commission in the area of FTT was published in February 2013.  Ireland had many concerns about the proposal as drafted, not the least of which were the potential impacts on, and the trading of, Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary market and in total, the potential negative impact on the liquidity of the financial sector as a whole.</p>  <p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst other Member states, including some of the participating countries.</p>  <p>  Opponents of the EU FTT, including Ireland, continue to argue that it only makes sense if it covers many countries or else transactions will shift toward those financial centres which are not covered by it.</p>  <p>  Much uncertainty still remains as to the form any FTT might take or if the initiative will be agreed to at all.</p></reply>

However it remains vital that a legally-binding backstop is agreed to provide certainty that, in any circumstances, a hard border will be avoided.</p>  <p>  The EU has been clear that the backstop is an essential element of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement and that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the Commission have both stressed that substantial progress on the backstop is needed before the June European Council. Based on the negotiations between the UK and the Commission Taskforce in the coming days and weeks, Michel Barnier will make an assessment of progress, for consideration by the Taoiseach and his counterparts at the European Council three weeks from now.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the recent presentation by the UK of written proposals aimed at making progress in the Brexit negotiations is welcomed.  The Commission will make a first assessment of the technical and legal feasibility of the proposals, and whether they provide a basis for negotiation.  We look forward to its assessment and to discussing whether the proposals could be helpful in meeting the UK&rsquo;s repeated commitment to avoiding a hard border, and thereby making progress on the backstop on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In terms of security and safety, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for the security of the State and any issues relating to the safety and security of Customs Officers or Customs facilities are addressed to that organisation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-12a.624.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061200070#WRN03300"><p>All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  The CWMF is mandated by circular and was developed to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.  It provides an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.</p>  <p>  The conditions of the public works contracts which are used for the delivery of the majority of building and civil engineering projects are fixed price, lump sum contracts.  This requirement is key to ensuring greater cost certainty in the delivery of the public capital programme.  When tendering public works contracts, contractors are expected to take account of cost increases due to inflation on the primary inputs up to the project&rsquo;s completion.  On projects with long delivery programmes, an adjustment to the contract sum for inflation is possible but only after the pre-determined fixed price period has elapsed.</p>  <p>  In order to take cost increases due to inflation into account when pricing a project it is accepted that a degree of foresight is required on the likely increases in the input costs such as labour, materials and plant over the duration of the project.</p>  <p>  The primary input costs on construction projects are labour, materials and plant.  Increases in the cost of fuel can also impact on certain categories of projects. With regards to labour costs, the Deputy refers to Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs) which are established in accordance with the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  An SEO imposes minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for specified categories of workers.  Employers employing the specified categories of workers must comply with the provisions of an SEO covering the sector in which they are operating.</p>  <p>  To date, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, has signed into law two SEOs that cover workers in the construction sector: SI 455 of 2017 covering the construction sector on 19 October 2017; and SI 59 of 2018 covering the mechanical engineering building services contracting sector on 6 March 2018.  </p>  <p>  Whilst it is the case that there were no transitional arrangements introduced when the SEOs were signed into law, nonetheless there was an 11 month process leading up to the establishment of the first SEO in October 2017.</p>  <p>  In November 2016 an application was made to the Labour Court by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) to commence the process.  As a body who represents significant numbers of employers in the construction sector it must be presumed that this application was made with the knowledge of its members.  An invitation for submissions by interested parties was published by the Labour Court in February 2017.  This was followed by an invitation from the Labour Court to an oral hearing on 26 June 2017 to those who made submissions.  The CIF, having made a submission was one of the bodies invited to the hearing.  Having concluded its deliberations, the Labour Court issued a recommendation to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on 13 July 2017 which was published shortly thereafter.  The Minister, having accepted the recommendation, submitted a draft order to both Houses of the Oireachtas and it was signed into law on 19 October 2017 after a resolution approving it had been passed by each House.</p>  <p>  Wages in this sector have experienced increases in recent years as evidenced by average increases of 6% year on year in the biannual tender price index published by the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland since 2014.  The foregoing would suggest that contractors should have been taking wage inflation into account when tendering for construction contracts; public or private.  Indeed the SCSI tender price index would suggest that contractors have been taking wage inflation into account in pricing work.</p>  <p>  I have received several representations on behalf of contractors operating under the public works contracts.  The correspondence has identified the difficulties being experienced by those contractors whose tender prices did not account for the increased cost of labour represented by the introduction of the SEOs.</p>  <p>  The conditions of the public works contract have been in general use since 2007 and industry is well aware of their fixed price requirement.  It must be assumed therefore that this issue has arisen due to a lack of awareness of the process that was being undertaken and this is something that I will bring to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

The ESB advises me that the levels are relatively low at present, as of 6th June 2018.</p>  <p>  Consultation with ESB confirms that the weir at Athlone is primarily designed to maintain minimum levels in Lough Ree.  Waterways Ireland is responsible for the operation of sluice structures in weirs at Tarmonbarry and three other locations under the direction of ESB.  The current level is as required by ESB to maintain services and to ensure enough water to provide for the minimum flow required for environmental purposes.</p>  <p>  From April 1st 2013 ESB, in conjunction with Waterways Ireland, has been applying a trial protocol to reduce the minimum target level in Lough Ree during summer periods at the request of OPW.  Prior to this trial the minimum target level in Lough Ree was 37.65m O.D. at the end of June.  As a result of the trial the minimum target level is now 37.55m O.D. on June 30th.  As of 6th June 2018, the level in Lough Ree is at 37.64m O.D.  Based on the current weather forecast and with 4 sluices open at Athlone Weir the level in Lough Ree is expected to approach 37.60m O.D. by mid- June.  Achieving the minimum target level of 37.55m O.D. by end of June is weather dependent.</p></reply>

An SEO imposes minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for specified categories of workers.  Employers employing the specified categories of workers must comply with the provisions of an SEO covering the sector in which they are operating.</p><p>Registered Employment Agreements were the previous means of establishing minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment in certain economic sectors.  The manner in which these agreements were registered was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 leaving the National Minimum Wage as the only wage rate enforceable by statute.</p><p>To date, my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has signed into law two SEOs that cover workers in the construction sector: SI 455 of 2017 covering the construction sector on 19 October 2017; and SI 59 of 2018 covering the mechanical engineering building services contracting sector on 6 March 2018.  </p><p>All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  The CWMF is mandated by circular and was developed to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.  It provides an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review.</p><p>The conditions of the public works contracts which are used for the delivery of the majority of building and civil engineering projects are fixed price, lump sum contracts.  This requirement is key to ensuring greater cost certainty in the delivery of the public capital programme.  When tendering public works contracts, contractors are expected to take account of cost increases due to inflation up to the project&rsquo;s completion.  On projects with long delivery programmes, an adjustment to the contract sum for inflation is possible but only after the pre-determined fixed price period has elapsed.</p><p>In order to take cost increases due to inflation into account when pricing a project it is accepted that a degree of foresight is required on the likely increases in the input costs such as labour, materials and plant over the duration of the project.</p><p>Whilst it is the case that there were no transitional arrangements introduced when the SEOs were signed into law, nonetheless there was an 11 month process leading up to the establishment of the first SEO in October 2017.</p><p>In November 2016 an application was made to the Labour Court by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) to commence the process.  As a body who represents significant numbers of employers in the construction sector it must be presumed that this application was made with the knowledge of its members.  An invitation for submissions by interested parties was published by the Labour Court in February 2017.  This was followed by an invitation from the Labour Court to an oral hearing on 26 June 2017 to those who made submissions.  Having concluded its deliberations, the Labour Court issued a recommendation to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the 13 July 2017 which was published shortly thereafter and was picked up in various national media outlets.  The Minister, having accepted the recommendation, submitted a draft order to both Houses of the Oireachtas and it was signed into law on 19 October 2017 after a resolution approving it had been passed by each House.</p><p>Wages in this sector have experienced increases in recent years as evidenced by average increases of 6% year on year in the biannual tender price index published by the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland since 2014.  The foregoing would suggest that contractors should have been taking wage inflation into account when tendering for construction contracts; public or private.  Indeed the SCSI tender price index would suggest that contractors <i>have</i>been taking wage inflation into account in pricing work.</p><p>Circular 08/2018 was issued on 24 May 2018 through the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which sets out the amendments that have been undertaken to the CWMF to reflect the introduction of the SEOs in the construction sector.  These amendments will apply to tenders and contracts that are commenced after the periods set out in the circular and do not change the fixed price nature of the contracts.</p><p>I have received representations from the CIF, fellow Ministers and Deputies on behalf of contractors operating under the public works contracts.  The correspondence has identified the difficulties being experienced by those contractors whose tender prices did not account for the increased cost of labour represented by the introduction of the SEOs.</p><p>The conditions of the public works contract have been in general use since 2007 and industry is well aware of the fixed price requirement.  It must be assumed therefore that this issue has arisen due to a lack of awareness of the process that was being undertaken and this is something that I will bring to the attention of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

Primary legislation is required for this change to be implemented.   The Government has approved the General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to its decision and I asked the Attorney General to prioritise the drafting of this legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible.  The drafting process is currently under way and the Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the current session.  The drafting of the legislation is significantly advanced with an expected publication date, subject to Government approval in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for the Bill to be drafted and pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas, given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations, and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill is being treated as a priority and my intention is to bring forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In order to make some accommodation for public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government Decision of 5 December and the commencement of the necessary legislation, the Government approved some limited interim arrangements which became effective from the date of the Government Decision.  The interim arrangements (which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65) will, through retire and re-hire, enable pre-2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 to remain in employment until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66, should they wish to do so.  Details of these interim implementation arrangements have been put in place by the relevant sectors.</p></reply>

This will provide comprehensive detail on the latest position on the implementation of the programme across the whole of Government.  In terms of my own Department, some areas of particular focus include the following:</p>  <p> - Our Public Service 2020 was published in December 2017 and sets out a new framework for public service reform. Its actions will build a stronger public service and deliver better quality services over the period 2018 to 2020 and beyond.  Implementation of these actions is well underway.</p>  <p> - The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which extends the Lansdowne Road Agreement, has been ratified by all parties and is now in place.  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 was passed in December 2017 to give effect to its terms.</p>  <p> - Following on from the first round of the three year Spending Review, which saw the publication of 22 papers, the second round is progressing.</p>  <p> - The policy paper 'Equality Budgeting: Proposed Next Steps in Ireland' sets out the pilot approach that is currently progressing for equality budgeting in the 2018 budgetary cycle. Learnings from the pilot, supported by an expert advisory group, will expand the initiative for the next budgetary cycle.</p>  <p> - The 10 year National Development Plan commits to &euro;91 billion of Exchequer capital investment over the period of the Plan (2018-2027), bringing public capital investment levels in Ireland as a % of national income to amongst the highest in the EU.</p>  <p> - The PEACE and INTERREG programmes have been a key element of the EU's continuing commitment to the process of peace building and reconciliation and support for the Good Friday Agreement.  A key priority of the PEACE IV programme is Shared Education to bring together school children and teachers from different communities and backgrounds.  Projects have also been designed to help people live, learn and socialise with each other free from prejudice and hate. </p>  <p>  Further details on the implementation of these and other priorities from the Programme for Partnership Government will be included in the upcoming Annual Report.   </p></reply>

Following the expiry of the first grace period in February 2012, those retiring after that date had their pension entitlements calculated on the basis of their actual final salary on the day of retirement.</p>  <p>  The further pay reduction applied to the cohort of public servants earning more than &euro;65,000 in June 2013 has also been subject to a similar grace period.  Currently, the lump sum of a retiring public servant in that cohort is calculated on the basis of the pre-2013 pay cut rate of pay (adjusted for the general pay increase of 1% from 1 January 2018 under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017).  Because of the expiration of the grace period and in the context of pay restoration, from 2 April 2019 onwards, pensions and lump sums will again be based on actual pay, not grace-period-protected pay.  This will apply equally to individuals who are not at the top point of their pay scale and whose increments were paused under FEMPI 2013; the pension entitlements of such individuals will be calculated based on their current pay point at retirement rather than the pay point they would have been on had the increment pauses not occurred.  Accordingly, individuals in that group retiring from 2 April 2019 onwards should have regard to their own particular salary point and current or future pay increments in their retirement planning.</p></reply>

The nature of many of the reform initiatives set out in ambitious reform plans, such as Our Public Service 2020 and the Public Service ICT Strategy, is that up-front investment is sometimes required to deliver service improvements and greater consolidation and efficiency across the Civil and Public Service in the medium and long term.  Therefore, this can involve my Department taking on additional costs, including capital costs, in the short-term.  </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s capital allocation for the years 2019 to 2022 is set out below.</p><p><table><tr><th>Subhead and Vote</th><th>2019 &euro;m</th><th>2020 &euro;m</th><th>2021 &euro;m</th><th>2022 &euro;m</th><th>Total &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Subhead and Vote</td><td>2019 &euro;m</td><td>2020 &euro;m</td><td>2021 &euro;m</td><td>2022 &euro;m</td><td>Total &euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>B.6 OGCIO</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>DPER Vote 11 (Total)</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>OGP Vote 39</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Departmental Total </td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>24</td></tr></table></p><p>Capital allocations for 2023 will be determined during the Budget 2019 process.  The multi-annual Exchequer capital allocations agreed in Budget 2018 under the National Development Plan underpin each Department&rsquo;s capital planning process for a five-year period from 2018 to 2022.  These five-year allocations will be reviewed and extended annually on a rolling basis to include a fifth year, as part of the annual Estimates process.  This will provide Government with an annual opportunity to review the allocations in light of any implementation issues arising and/or new priorities which may emerge as the National Development Plan is implemented.</p><p>The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), which is also part of my Department, invests and develops IT infrastructure on behalf of my Department, the Department of Finance, the National Shared Services Office and the OGP.  However, its broader role is to leverage ICT to gain efficiencies and to improve the effectiveness of service delivery across the Civil and Public Service.  </p><p>The OGCIO takes the lead on driving forward the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy, working with Departments and agencies across the Public Service.  Capital investment in the period will be allocated to projects that support the five strategic themes of the strategy which are; Build to Share, Digital First, Data as an Enabler, Improve Governance, and Increase Capability.  For instance, under the Build to Share pillar of the Strategy, the OGCIO continues to enhance the Government Network that has been in existence for many years.  As a result of this investment, the Network will operate at higher speeds, providing high capacity services to the wider Public Service.  The enhanced network will support agencies in the roll-out of new applications, new ways of working and engaging with the citizen.  </p><p>The OGP continues to invest in its IT systems to deliver on its mandate to drive procurement savings to the State.  For example, the OGP is continuing to invest in the eTenders platform to support national and EU procurement requirements.  A CRM / Workflow Management System is also being implemented to support OGP&rsquo;s Customer Service function and sourcing activities of the OGP and its sector partners. </p></reply>

Figures presented for 2010 &ndash; 2016 are based on the Appropriation Accounts, while figures for 2017 are the Provisional Outturn amounts notified by Departments.  The 2017 Provisional Outturn does not include any amount in respect of capital carryover spent in 2017.  Capital expenditure of &euro;74 million was carried over from 2016 into 2017. 2018 figures presented here are as set out in the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume (REV). </p><p>A number of technical adjustments are reflected in the table below.  At the beginning of 2015 the HSE Vote was disestablished, with voted funding for the HSE now provided from the Department of Health Vote.  As a consequence of this change, certain items, amounting to approximately &euro;1 billion in 2014, previously accounted for as appropriations-in-aid in the HSE Vote are collected directly as income by the HSE and reflected in the HSE accounts.  This impacts on the year-on-year change between 2014 and 2015.  Adjusting to allow a like-for-like comparison, the year-on-year change between 2014 and 2015 is 2.8% for gross voted expenditure.  REV 2018 saw a significant technical adjustment relating to the funding of domestic water services.  Following enactment of the Water Services Act 2017 all motor tax receipts are being paid into the Exchequer rather than the Local Government Fund and all State funding for domestic water services is now provided from voted expenditure by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools.  This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year.  This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector. </p></reply>

In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion.  Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  The process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of the Minor Works Grant to primary schools.  The National Development Plan 2018-2027 signals a gradual ramping up in capital expenditure in the schools sector over the coming years.  In that context, and as part of our longer term infrastructural planning, my Department would intend to put the Minor Works Grant on an annual footing and to provide greater certainty to schools on the timing of payment.</p></reply>

The announcement mentioned by the Deputy refers to undergraduate students only and therefore the criteria governing the level of tuition fees to be charged in the case of postgraduate study is solely a matter for each of the higher education institutions to determine in accordance with its own criteria as an autonomous body. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that additional funding of &euro;4 million was secured in Budget 2017 to facilitate the reinstatement of full maintenance grants, from September 2017, for the most disadvantaged postgraduate students.  A further &euro;3m was secured in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  Postgraduate students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme for the 2018/19 academic year are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915; the income threshold for this grant is &euro;23,500.  Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.</p>  <p>  Alternatively a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees.  The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500.  The student grant scheme does not extend to postgraduate courses pursued outside of Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for the Student Assistance Fund (SAF).  The fund is available in various publicly funded higher education institutions.  The SAF provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials.  The SAF is open to full-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.  </p>  <p>  Tax relief is available on postgraduate tuition fees paid and details in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that in implementing the free fees scheme, and the student grant scheme, my Department needs to be conscious of the need for consistency in how individuals are treated and also of the potential financial and other policy implications arising from any specific amendments to either scheme.</p></reply>

This innovative pilot will complement existing HSE funded provision of essential therapy services.  </p>  <p>  75 schools, including a representative sample of primary, post primary, and special schools will take part in the project.  75 pre-schools will also participate giving 150 settings.</p>  <p>  The project is taking place in Community Healthcare Organisation 7 Region of South West Dublin, Kildare and West Wicklow and the schools selected will therefore be from this region.</p>  <p>  As part of the programme, 19 speech and language therapists and 12 Occupational Therapists are being recruited by the HSE to work with the 150 schools and pre-schools.  The NCSE will also recruit 2 National Co-ordinators to manage the project.</p>  <p>  This recruitment process is ongoing and the bulk of expenditure under this project will occur once the posts are in place and salary costs for post holders arise.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.25m is being allocated to Phase One of the project in 2018, however, the actual expenditure on the in-school therapy services project in 2018 will not be known until financial reporting has been completed at the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased to confirm that provision was made within the Budget 2018 for the employment of an additional 10 psychologist staff within my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) with effect in the coming academic year.  </p>  <p>  The recruitment of these staff has already commenced utilising regional panels maintained by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  Arrangements are in hand with the PAS to shortly put in place a new recruitment competition to replenish these panels sufficient to complete this process and to service the ongoing recruitment needs of the NEPS into the future.  </p>  <p>  The full year cost of this 10 post expansion will be in the region of &euro;0.7m.  This will bring the overall complement of NEPS Psychologists to some 194 whole-time equivalents, the highest level since the Service&rsquo;s inception, allowing for a broadening and deepening of the service provided to schools and underpinning my Department&rsquo;s and this Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting an effective educational psychological service.</p></reply>

This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Also included in circular 40/2018 is an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year.

In order to put in place the capacity to deliver on actions assigned to PPLI, due process has been followed and 4 additional staff are now being recruited to the PPLI, two of whom commenced work in May.  The first PPLI action was an audit of foreign languages provision in post-primary schools and this was completed with minimal cost.  An awareness raising campaign on the value of learning foreign languages, languages upskilling courses for teachers, the promotion of language exchanges abroad and an awards scheme for businesses with good practice in relation to foreign languages are among some of the projects currently being planned during 2018.  With the need for appropriate resourcing, advance planning and adherence to best practice, funding is only now being drawn down.  The only costs to date are one month's salary for two new members of staff and the creation of videos which will be part of the awareness raising campaign.  In all about &euro;35,000 has been spent to date from the &euro;1.5m allocation for foreign languages.</p>  <p>  &euro;1.5m has been allocated for STEM.  This has not yet been drawn down but will be spent in 2018 on the following:</p>  <p>  - STEM clusters</p>  <p>  - Promotion of STEM to include Awareness campaign</p>  <p>  - Support for STEM to include PDST STEM team</p>  <p>  Funds were also allocated to The School Excellence Fund (SEF) &ndash; Digital.  The funding for the SEF &ndash; Digital has not as yet been allocated to the successful schools owing to the fact that the clustered schools are still working on finalising their budget submissions.  It is expected that over the next few weeks all budgets will be submitted from the clusters.  The submissions will then be reviewed and, when approval has been given by the working group, ICT policy unit will begin processing the payments to each cluster group.

In 2018, Skillnet Ireland has also established 5 new learning networks in sectors which are experiencing significant workforce development demand, including hospitality, recruitment, advanced electronics and manufacturing.  Skillnet Ireland now funds 67 networks.  </p>  <p>  The additional funding has also facilitated an increase in Skillnet Ireland's investment in its Future Skills Programme, whereby its learning networks develop new programmes that address emerging skills needs in areas such as artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing and global business services, MedTech, agriculture and retail amongst others.</p>  <p>  By the end of May 2018, Skillnet Ireland has received &euro;10m of their 2018 allocation.</p></reply>

Webwise.ie website promotes the autonomous, effective and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents and children themselves with consistent and relevant messages.</p>  <p>  Schools are also advised on the development and implementation of an Acceptable Usage Policy (governing the use of the internet in schools); the promotion of awareness regarding safety online; and the implementation of a content filtering/monitoring system which my Department provides to schools through the Schools Broadband Access Programme.</p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 is to promote responsible and ethical use of the internet and related technologies and to continue to undertake awareness-raising actions and programmes that promote responsible and ethical use of the internet.  My Department recently published a circular requesting schools to consult with parents and students and teachers to develop and inform policies for the use of smart phones and tablet devices in schools.</p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools also commits to &euro;210m in funding for multi-annual ICT Infrastructure Grants to schools over the period of the Strategy.  The second tranche of this funding (&euro;30m), in respect of the 2017/2018 school year, has issued to schools.  </p>  <p>  Online safety of children is a matter relevant to many Government Departments, as well as parents and the wider society.  This requires a whole of Government approach and my Department is collaborating with these Departments on the development of an Action Plan on Internet Safety led by the Department of An Taoiseach.  Ongoing engagement is also maintained the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which has a lead role in coordinating Government policy for internet safety, and also with the Department of Justice and Equality through their Office for Internet Safety.</p></reply>

I believe that the new schools reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system.  </p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, including Leixlip.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including:</p>  <p>  - a new 8-classroom primary school to be established in 2019 to serve the Leixlip school planning area.</p>  <p>  - a new 8-classroom primary school to be established in 2019 to serve the Maynooth school planning area.</p>  <p>  - a new 8-classrooms primary school to be established in 2021 to serve the Naas school planning area.  </p>  <p>  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron and language of instruction, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p></reply>

In line with this policy, I announced last month that 800 additional SNAs will be allocated for the beginning of the next school year, with a further 140 expected to be allocated by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, there will be a total of 15,000 Special Needs Assistants working in our schools, a 42% increase on 2011.</p>  <p>  The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support on the grounds that Department policy was not met in accordance with Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA support to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the children concerned.</p>  <p>  Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2018/19, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, they may continue to make applications to the NCSE.  The closing date for receipt of any appeals in regard to SNA allocations is Friday, 28th September 2018.</p>  <p>  As this question relates to an individual child I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply.</p></reply>

Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion. </p>  <p>  I recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years.  Restoring capitation funding as resources permit is one of the actions included in the Action Plan for Education.</p>  <p>  The process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016, &euro;5 in 2017 and &euro;5 in 2018, in order to enable primary schools to implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation. A similar type approach in relation to improvements in grant funding was applied, as appropriate, at post-primary level.</p></reply>

SNA allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.  My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support. In line with this policy, I announced last month that 800 additional SNAs will be allocated for the beginning of the next school year, with a further 140 expected to be allocated by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  By the end of this year, there will be a total of 15,000 Special Needs Assistants working in our schools, a 42% increase on 2011.</p>  <p>  The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support on the grounds that Department policy was not met in accordance with Circular 0030/2014. </p>  <p>  Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA support to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the children concerned.</p>  <p>  Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2018/19, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, they may continue to make applications to the NCSE.

In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many Deaf or hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children who are Deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) provides additional special educational needs teaching supports to mainstream schools, and provides for special class and special school placements  and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support to all schools.</p>  <p>  In 2018/19 school year, there will be over 1,440 special classes in mainstream schools, of which 15 are for students who are deaf and 1 early intervention special class for the Deaf. Of the 124 special schools nationally, there are 2 special schools for the Deaf. There are currently no special classes or special schools for the Deaf in Co. Mayo. I have arranged for the NCSE to provide information directly to the Deputy, relating to supports for students who are deaf in mainstream classes in Co. Mayo and how it compares nationally.</p>  <p>  The NCSE's new Support Service, through its Visiting Teacher Service for children who are Hearing Impaired, work in partnership with parents of hearing impaired children throughout Ireland, visiting their homes and/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to the child&rsquo;s education and overall development and in helping the children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.  </p>  <p>  The Support Service also provides funding for individual teachers and whole school staff in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary, special schools, and special classes to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers. Included in the brief of the Support Service is to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and support for teachers. </p>  <p>  Additional supports provided by my Department include funding to schools for assistive technology such as radio aids and Soundfield systems, special transport arrangements for pupils and enhanced levels of capitation in Special schools and Special Classes. </p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of Deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents in all Counties including Mayo. </p>  <p>  The NCSE published Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, including recommendations relating to ISL provision.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Comprehensive review of the SNA Scheme, which has been recently published, makes a number of recommendations relating to students who are deaf or hard of hearing. Relating specifically to students who are deaf, the NCSE recommends Irish Sign Language qualified assistants in schools, to support profoundly deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this provision should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of this review and the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, a scheme will be developed to provide Irish Sign Language support for students attending recognised schools, whose primary language is Irish Sign Language; while my Department will also seek to ensure that there are a sufficient number of educational placements offering Irish Sign Language training for teachers of children who are hearing impaired, and to determine, from time to time, the minimum qualifications of these teachers.</p></reply>

Securing skills supply from the education and training to the construction sector is a major focus of my Department as part of broader Government actions to increase housing supply and roll out the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework.</p>  <p>  Construction related apprentice registrations increased from 1,713 in 2015 to 2,314 in 2016 which represents an increase of 35%.  This trend continued in 2017 with a further increase of 28% on the 2016 figure bringing the total number of construction related registrations to 2,963.  </p>  <p>  Apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme, which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market. Consequently, the number of construction related apprentices being registered is determined by employers within the construction sector. My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, we are currently expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry. Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 an apprenticeship in Engineering Services Management, with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) as industry lead, is currently being developed into a national apprenticeship programme.  In addition, we recently announced 26 new programmes, arising from last year&rsquo;s second call for proposals, to be further developed into national apprenticeships, including a scaffolding apprenticeship, again with the CIF as industry lead and a senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland as industry lead. These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs identified by the sector.</p>  <p>  In relation to the wet trades, highlighted as areas of particular concern in the report, SOLAS in partnership with CIF and Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB) operated a pilot initiative in the last year to test the viability of a shared apprenticeship scheme.  Following analysis of the pilot outcomes and in consultation with both the CIF and WWETB, I understand that SOLAS decided not to operationalise the pilot initiative more widely.  In particular, it was found that the pilot did not attract employers in sufficient numbers to suggest that the scheme had the potential to have a significant impact on apprenticeship recruitment.  However, I understand from SOLAS that they are currently in discussions with representatives from the construction industry to assess how the scheme could be made more viable.</p>  <p>  I intend to meet with the Construction Industry Federation in the coming weeks to discuss the report in question and I look forward to engaging with them on issues relating to employer engagement with the apprenticeship programme.</p></reply>

The GIS records the number of primary and post-primary schools within each planning area, the combined enrolments for all of the schools within each area, including total enrolment and enrolment in each class group, together with child benefit data for the 0-4 age group relevant to the area. </p>  <p>  In most areas, school planning areas were based on traditional school catchment areas where all primary schools were assigned to a post-primary feeder area (typically a population centre or town), containing one or more post-primary schools.  The school planning areas were developed for use with the GIS in 2008 and with the introduction of Small Areas in Census 2011, these areas were amended to align with Census Small Areas. The current school planning areas take account not only of local groupings of schools, but also of natural boundaries, Census Small Areas and other local conditions. These school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the recent demographic exercises, my Department engaged with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). </p></reply>

The closing date for receipt of any appeals in regard to SNA allocations is Friday, 28th September 2018.</p>  <p>  As this question relates to an individual child, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. </p></reply>

Schools are permitted to regard the Capitation and Ancillary grants as a combined grant.  </p>  <p>  In addition, enhanced payments are made for all students attending special schools and special classes.  The rates vary, depending on the particular category of disability.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for procurement of insurance and payment of same rests with Board of Management in respect of schools operated by them.  If a particular school has a query in relation to the cost of insurance it should raise this directly with its insurance provider.  Boards of Management should take a proactive approach when it comes to sourcing insurance in order to ensure best value is obtained and to ensure compliance with public procurement procedures.  Schools Procurement Unit which has a national remit is available to advise and assist schools in relation to procurement matters.  </p>  <p>  Issues relating specifically to insurance costs in special schools were brought to my attention, through correspondence received from a number of special schools and through discussions with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education (NABMSE) .</p>  <p>  I am advised that general increases in costs this year were due, in some instances, to an annual increase in insurance costs generally and in some cases, an increase in claims against special schools.  </p>  <p>  Separately, a number of special schools under the patronage of organisations that are funded by the HSE to provide health and personal social services on behalf of the HSE under Section 38 of the Health Act, experienced increased insurance quotes, when the funded bodies were delegated to the General Indemnity Scheme (GIS) under the State Claims Agency.  </p>  <p>  The effect of the delegation was that the special schools under their patronage needed to seek separate insurance cover.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have been working with the State Claims Agency, in recent months, to seek a resolution to this issue.  General agreement has been reached and work is underway to determine whether the special schools directly affected can be included under the General Indemnity Scheme.</p></reply>

My Department advises a school authority of this at the time the grant for the works is being approved.  Schools are also advised that the Revenue Commissioners have published a guidance document for school management authorities in this matter which is available on both my Departments website and the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; website</p>  <p>  The main requirement for a school to meet its obligations is to register with the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; online system and to follow the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; guidance in relation to deducting and paying over tax, where this arises, for the contractor carrying out the works.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to decide, in the context of the specific tax affairs of the individual contractors employed by schools, whether or not tax is to be applied to the service being provided and at what rate that tax should be applied.  </p>  <p>  Before the grant for the works can be drawn down from my Department, a school authority must confirm to my Department that it has complied with its tax obligations.   A grant will not be paid in the absence of this confirmation.  However, the tax treatment itself of the services provided lies within the competency of the Revenue Commissioners and this aspect is, therefore, strictly a matter between a school authority and that Body.  My Department does not keep the statistical data sought by the Deputy for these reasons.</p></reply>

The review will look at the quality of information available to students and adults in relation to career guidance, the sources of this information and how the system is organised to support students and adults in this area.  </p>  <p>The review is being carried out by independent consultants and will be guided and informed by a Steering Group.  As part of the consultants proposed methodological approach to the review, my Department invited submissions from all interested stakeholders to assist in shaping the review by highlighting key issues to be considered in the course of carrying out the review.  Drawing on the results of the consultation and further consideration by the Steering Group the question of the role and objectives of career guidance in supporting students in special schools will be assessed further.  The closing date for receipt of submissions was Friday 1 June 2018.  </p>  <p>  In relation to career guidance for 16 to 18 year old persons attending special schools, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for determining the appropriate staffing levels in special schools.  Enhanced pupil teacher and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) ratios are provided to special schools to support them in dealing with pupil&rsquo;s educational and care needs.  Special schools are staffed based on their actual current pupil profiles and the disability category of each pupil, as opposed to primarily by school designation, in recognition that many special schools now enrol students from disability categories other than those provided for by their original school designations.  This process means that it is for school authorities to determine its staffing requirements in accordance with the requirements of the cohort of students attending the school which includes how best to use that resource to cater for curricular content.</p></reply>

For school planning purposes Skerries is located in the Skerries school planning area.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  Approximately 40% of school places are delivered by extending existing schools, rather than by building new schools.</p>  <p>  I have highlighted that the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

This will form the basis of discussions with the majority patron (the Catholic Bishop in most cases) concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school to meet that demand.  Each ETB will then draw up a comprehensive report on the position in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas for submission to the Department of Education and Skills, which will subsequently publish the reports.</p>  <p>  It is planned that, following the publication of the reports, the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase, involving existing patrons consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the demand for diversity by transferring patronage of an existing school to a new multi-/non-denominational patron.</p>  <p>  The new process supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  In that process, proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered will be taken into account.</p>  <p>  This process is entirely separate to the delivery of projects for any particular school in the survey area and will not affect the school building project to which the Deputy refers.</p></reply>

Over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand.  </p><p>To date, almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the Scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools, for Gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works..  Details of the successful school applicants, are published on the Department's website<i>www.education.ie</i>. </p><p>In relation to the Summer Works Scheme 2018, over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for 178 schools nationwide to be completed.  These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the Summer Works Scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in Quarter 2 as in previous years.  This will also help ensure that works done under the Summer Works Scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan.  The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for  2019 onwards.</p></reply>

A team of 7 Inspectors, who have also been currently assigned to the Unit on the part-time basis, are providing advisory support through Irish to schools participating in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme. </p>  <p>  To support the implementation of the Policy, provision has also been made for 2 additional Education Officer posts in An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta &amp;amp; Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG) who are delivering CPD through the medium of Irish to schools participating in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme. </p>  <p>  Primary and post-primary schools participating in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme can also access additional part-time language support hours equivalent to 30 whole time equivalent (WTE) primary teachers and 10 WTE post-primary teachers from September 2018.  Also, in September 2018, an additional teacher is being allocated to each of 2 post-primary schools under For&aacute;s, which is a pilot Irish-language development programme aimed at supporting certain junior-cycle students in their transition to Irish-medium education.</p>  <p>  To work towards increasing the number of primary and post-primary teachers who can provide high quality Irish-medium education and enhancing existing capacity, a number of other initiatives have also been commenced to support the implementation of the Gaeltacht Policy.  To date, these include provision for two additional teaching posts on the Professional Masters in Education at NUIG. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the pre-pilot phase of an e-hub project is also at an advanced stage.  The purpose of the e-Hub pilot project is to connect a number of small Irish-medium schools or Irish-medium units in Gaeltacht areas so as to extend the range of curricular choices in an online environment through the medium of Irish available to post-primary students, particularly at senior cycle, in these schools.  An invitation to apply for two part-time e-Teacher posts of Leaving Certificate Higher-Level Physics to participate in this e-Hub Pilot Project has recently issued to Gaeltacht and all-Irish post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  In budget 2018, the Government doubled the investment being made in Gaeltacht education.  A budgetary allocation of &euro;2.3m was provided for the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education in 2018. </p>  <p>  To support the provision of a service through Irish by the Department of Education and Skills an Irish Information Line has been put in place.  The number of staff assigned to answering the dedicated Irish Information Line has increased by 3 since April 2017.</p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) currently employ 24 educational psychologists that are proficient in the Irish language.  At the Schools Inspectorate Division at primary level there are 11 inspectors who have schools in Gaeltacht areas as part of their district.  Inspectors at primary level have sufficient proficiency to evaluate the teaching and learning of Irish in primary schools.  At post-primary level, the inspectors are in the main specialists in subject areas and post-primary inspectors also provides services to schools that teach the curriculum through Irish including Gaeltacht schools. </p>  <p>  In both the Junior Cycle for Teachers support service  (JCT) and the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) there has been an increase of 4 additional advisors in each of these two support services since January 2017 who have been tasked to deliver services through Irish.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has 22 Visiting Teachers, 6 advisors, 1 Speech and Language Therapist, 1 Occupational Therapist, 2 Special Education Needs Organisers and 1 administrative staff member who specifically deliver services in Irish when required.  The NCSE currently have a number of additional teaching staff seconded to them who are mainly primary school teachers who are proficient in Irish.  This cohort of staff joined the NCSE in March 2017 as part of the transition of National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and Special Education Support Service (SESS) services to the NCSE.</p>  <p>  Questions relating to the provision of speech and language therapy through the HSE primary care service should be directed to the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

This dual approach reduces the focus on one externally assessed examination as a means of assessing students and increases the prominence given to classroom-based assessment and formative assessment, providing a more rounded assessment of the education of each young person.  This change of emphasis arises from an acknowledgement that students learn best when teachers provide feedback that helps students to understand how their learning can be improved.  As part of the phasing in of the new Framework for Junior Cycle the new Junior Cycle music specification will be introduced to schools from September 2018.</p>  <p>  The Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA) is a school based award issued by recognised schools which draws upon and reports on achievement across all elements of assessment including ongoing, formative assessment and Classroom-Based Assessments by teachers, as well as State Examinations marked by the State Examinations Commission.  The assessment of a number of practical subjects including music for the purposes of the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA) will comprise two Classroom-Based Assessments undertaken in recognised schools, a practical examination and a written examination.</p>  <p>  Where students take extra subjects outside of their school setting these subjects cannot satisfy the requirements for ongoing, formative assessment by recognised schools and cannot, therefore, be included as part of the JCPA.  Students who wish to study additional subjects, such as music, outside of their school have a number of other certification avenues open to them.</p></reply>

The Deputy will therefore appreciate that all applications for capital funding must be considered in the context of the existing challenging financial circumstances where funding must be prioritised for this purpose and to provide mainstream classroom accommodation where additional teachers are being appointed.  </p>  <p>  The school currently operates with a principal and four mainstream teachers and I understand that with the reduction in enrolment level at the school, that this warrants a staffing of principal and three mainstream teachers for the 2018/2019 school year. </p>  <p>  The nature of the works included in the school's application indicate that they are appropriate for consideration under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS). It will be open to the school, if it so decides, to make an application for funding under future SWS.  The purpose of the SWS is to devolve funding to individual school authorities to undertake small and medium scale improvement works that will upgrade existing school facilities, which can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school. The scheme is designed to address necessary and immediate works within the funding available.  My Department has no record of receiving any application from the school in question under the SWS in recent years. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, the school may use its minor works to carry out the works in full or on a phased basis as the grant permits, if the school considers the works to be a priority.  </p>  <p>  My Department has written directly to the school to clarify the position.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).

Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools. </p>  <p>  While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school in Kinnegad (which is located in the Killucan school planning area), I have highlighted that the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

In its April 2016 report to the Minister on the patronage process which included this new primary school, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) noted the strong level of demand for Irish-medium education in the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 area and recommended that this would be kept under review in the context of future demographic exercises.  In this regard, following completion of nationwide demographic exercises, on 12 April 2018, the Minister announced the establishment of 42 new schools from 2019 -2022, including a new primary school to be established in September 2019 to serve the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 school planning area. In the context of the NSEG report, and given the strong level of parental demand for a Gaelscoil in the area evidenced as part of the 2016 patronage process, it would be recommended that this would be established as a Gaelscoil under the patronage of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s query on the patronage process generally, a patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron and language of instruction, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. In this regard, the development of a new Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) is currently being finalised by my Department to provide objective information to such parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies.  </p>  <p>  My Department will subsequently compile a patronage report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG), an external independent advisory group which oversees the patronage process, and the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations my consideration.</p></reply>

In line with this policy, I announced last month that 800 additional SNAs will be allocated for the beginning of the next school year, with a further 140 expected to be allocated by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  By the end of this year, there will be a total of 15,000 Special Needs Assistants working in our schools, a 42% increase on 2011. </p>  <p>  The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support on the grounds that Department policy was not met in accordance with Circular 0030/2014. </p>  <p>  Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA support to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the children concerned.</p>  <p>  Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2018/19, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, they may continue to make applications to the NCSE.  The closing date for receipt of any appeals in regard to SNA allocations is Friday, 28th September 2018.</p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular school I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. </p></reply>

Migration is on the agenda and the meeting will likely take stock of progress on foot of the Conclusions of the 19 October 2017 European Council where the twenty-eight heads of state agreed that the EU&rsquo;s &ldquo;comprehensive, pragmatic and resolute&rdquo; migration strategy, which aims to restore control of external borders and to reduce arrivals and the number of deaths at sea, was bringing results and should be consolidated. </p>  <p>  Measures to be taken included maintaining vigilance on all migratory routes and readiness to react to any new trends or developments, support for EU Member States directly affected or involved, strengthened cooperation with international partners, as well as countries of origin, transit and destination, adequate financing and an increase in effective returns, to reduce the incentives of irregular migration. </p>  <p>  Further actions called for by the October 2017 European Council Conclusions include:</p>  <p>  - Full cooperation with Turkey on migration, and the full implementation of the EU - Turkey Statement</p>  <p>  - Enhanced returns and the further strengthening of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency</p>  <p>  - Applying voluntary resettlement schemes</p>  <p>  - Creating and applying the necessary leverage to achieve measurable results in terms of preventing illegal migration and returning irregular migrants.</p>  <p>  The upcoming June European Council is expected to discuss the ongoing negotiations to reform the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). The October 2017 Conclusions specifically referenced the CEAS, stating that the European Council would seek to reach a consensus during the first half of 2018 and calling for further convergence towards an agreement which strikes the right balance between responsibility and solidarity and ensures resilience to future crises. At present I am not aware of plans to discuss the migration situation in either Germany or Hungary.</p></reply>

Therefore, as the matter is still presently under active investigation it remains the position that any comments or interference by me, as Minister, would be wholly inappropriate.  </p>  <p>  However, I will state that I am satisfied that GSOC have taken ample care and consideration with regards to their investigations, dedicating immense time and resources to ensure that each complaint received is assessed in detail and to the highest investigative standards.  Furthermore, GSOC&rsquo;s independence must be respected and the Commission must be allowed to complete their important work, unimpeded.  To do otherwise, would be to severely limit the operational capabilities of this essential organisation.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, when the GSOC have completed all investigations relating to this tragic case the question as to whether there remain issues that require further investigation will be fully considered. It will then fall to be decided what further action, if any, should be taken.</p>  <p>  My predecessor and the former Taoiseach have met with the family and gave a commitment, which I have repeated, that when all investigations are completed I will consider what further investigation is warranted.  In that context, I believe that a meeting with the O'Farrell family at that stage, to hear from them at first hand their views on the outstanding issues, would be helpful.</p></reply>

Specifically, this involves considering the feasibility of establishing a specialised and dedicated insurance fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, funded by industry.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) has engaged with Insurance Ireland, submitting a mechanism for further cooperation and a costed proposal to Insurance Ireland in the latter half of 2017. Insurance Ireland has agreed to explore the proposal further, subject to a full cost benefit analysis, to be carried out by Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officers Working Group. The intention would be that such a dedicated Garda unit would be funded by Insurance Ireland members and non-members alike, i.e. all entities writing non-life insurance business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Further progress on this recommendation is dependent upon the outcome of this cost benefit analysis, which is currently awaited. As I have previously informed the House, Insurance Ireland has indicated that it expects to be in a position to provide an update in this regard by the end of June 2018.</p>  <p>  Any proposed agreed mechanism will, of course, ultimately be subject to the approval of the Garda Commissioner and myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

This will also be bolstered under the Act by the coming into operation later this year of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators that will determine disputed legal costs on foot of a set of Legal Costs Principles set out in Schedule One of that Act and will maintain a publicly accessible Register of its determinations.  It is also to be noted that section 169 of the 2015 Act puts the general principle of &lsquo;costs follow the event&rsquo; on a statutory footing and will also be commenced later this year.</p></reply>

In pursuance of this commitment, a new Community-based CCTV grant-aid scheme was launched by my Department in 2017 to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas. It is intended that the scheme will run for 3 years with funding of some &euro;1 million being made available each year.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Upon approval, applicants receive up-front payment of 50% of the grant with the balance to be paid when the system is fully operational.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that community CCTV is governed by section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006).  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must-</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and </p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment.</p>  <p>  In establishing the grant-aid scheme, the Department sought to make the process as user-friendly as possible while respecting these statutory requirements.  </p>  <p>  Both the application process and documentation were updated and streamlined as compared to the earlier scheme administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department, to make them more accessible to all groups wishing to avail of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Further, the Department consulted broadly, including with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Attorney General and the Local Government Management Agency.   In that regard, I understand that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner's Office has again confirmed that it is not querying and does not have any current concerns regarding the legislative underpinning of community CCTV systems.</p>  <p>  Systems funded under this scheme will supplement the existing network of CCTV systems in operation in the State, namely the 35 Garda CCTV schemes in operation comprising in excess of 500 cameras; as well as the 45 Community-based CCTV schemes encompassing some 367 cameras to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have access, and which were established under the previous grant-aid scheme funded by my Department between 2005 and 2013. </p>  <p>  11 applications have been received to date and my Department has been informed that a further 14 applications will be submitted in the near future. </p>  <p>  4 applications under the scheme have been approved to date, with approved funding totalling almost &euro;120,000.  3 of these approved applications are in relation to systems in County Wexford and 1 is in relation to a system in County Wicklow.  A further 4 applications are under active consideration. The remaining 3 applications submitted to date have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to provide the information necessary to qualify for grant-aid.</p>  <p>  My Department receives enquiries regarding the scheme from a broad spectrum of the public, including in particular local authorities, as well as residents associations, ad hoc community groups as well as private citizens.</p>  <p>  Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website www.justice.ie  In addition, my officials are available to provide assistance and guidance to any interested party in relation to the scheme, with a dedicated email address available for that purpose - communitycctv@justice.ie</p>  <p>  I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this grant-aid scheme and I encourage any interested groups to make contact with my Department with any queries or if they require assistance in relation to the scheme.</p></reply>

The Equal Status Acts 2000-2015 outlaw discrimination in the provision of goods and services.  Equality legislation also provides for remedies for those who have suffered discrimination.</p>  <p>  Mothers who wish to breast feed in public are protected from being discriminated or harassed under the equality legislation.  Under section 21 of the Equal Status Acts 2000-2015, a person may seek redress for discrimination by referring the case to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) or to the Circuit Court.  Section 27 of the Equal Status Act sets out the types of redress which the WRC or the Circuit Court may decide &ndash; and includes an order for compensation up to the maximum amount that can be ordered by the District Court in civil cases (&euro;15,000).  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of human rights and equality law.  IHREC can advise people and refer perceived cases of discrimination to the WRC for investigation and adjudication.</p></reply>

It retained full responsibility for this function until Part 3 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 was enacted and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) was established in December 2005.  It was not until GSOC became fully operational in 2007 that the responsibility for receiving complaints transferred in its entirety to the Commission.</p><p>Therefore, it was necessary to maintain the existence of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board and the related Appeal Board to enable these bodies to conclude cases which they were already investigating. Complaints which the Board had received but not commenced investigating were transferred to GSOC in accordance with transitional provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. </p><p>In May 2012 the Government re-appointed the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board as, at that time, there were still three remaining cases to be finalised. The last case was struck out in December 2013. </p><p>The term of office of the members serving on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Appeal Board expired on 16 December 2013 and from that date the Complaints Board operated with two staff. The two serving members of the Board were later assigned to GSOC.</p><p>Statutory Instrument No. 271 of 2015 provided for the repeal of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986 (as amended) with effect form 30 June 2015; this resulted in the dissolution of the Garda Complaints Board and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Appeal Board. </p><p>Expenditure for the Complaints Board amounted to &euro;179,563 in 2013. In 2014 it was &euro;175,740. There was no expenditure in 2015. In 2016 there was a payment of &euro;195.40, which related to the Statutory Instrument No. 271 of 2015. No expenditure has arisen since 2016.</p><p>GSOC is funded by a grant provided annually to the Commission through the Vote of the Department of Justice and Equality.

However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the attached table provides a breakdown of the number of behaviour warnings, by year and by region, for the period requested.For completeness, the table shows the figures for both children and adults, although they are listed separately.</p><p>It is, however, worth noting that any counts which were less than ten are displayed as an asterisk (*) in the tables.  This is due to data protection around provision of low count data.  Incident counts for Behaviour Orders (Children), Civil Orders (Adult)(LS) and Good Behaviour Contract (LS) are not shown as each incident type has a national count of less than ten per year in the period examined.</p><p>Of course, addressing local community concerns in relation to public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Community Policing Model and a range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard, including those under:</p><p>- the Criminal Damage Act 1991;</p><p>- Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;</p><p>- the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and</p><p>- the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5 million has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which inter alia supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.</p><p>The Government is also committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The Government will continue this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.</p><p><b>Behaviour Warnings (Adult) (I.S)</b><table><tr><th>Region/Division</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Region</td><td>214</td><td>327</td><td>646</td><td>333</td><td>479</td><td>410</td><td>694</td><td>587</td><td>302</td><td>728</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-12a.1244.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061200080#WRX03600"><p>I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime.  Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas, including counties Sligo and Leitrim.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Sligo/Leitrim Division on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available was 302.  There are also 17 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Sligo/Leitrim Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, very significant resources have been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in Budget 2018, to support large-scale policing operations including Operation Thor. </p><p>The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime under Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity.  As of 17 May 2018, 130,702 targeted checkpoints and 151,819 crime prevention patrols have been conducted nationwide.  To give you an idea of the impact of the operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 7,569 arrests and 8,613 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p><p>For its part, the Government remains totally committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our society, which includes actions taken under Operation Thor.  Indeed, some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018.  This is an increase of approximately 2% over the allocation for 2017.  &euro;98.5 million has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018 which represents an increase of &euro;10 million over the initial allocation for 2017 (which amounted to &euro;88.5 million).  In November 2017, the Minister for Justice and Equality secured a supplementary estimate of some &euro;42 million for Garda overtime, bringing the spend for 2017 to over &euro;130 million.  This compares to a spend in previous years of &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and some &euro;37.7 million in 2014. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p><p>On 2 January 2018 I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017.  The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is<i>www.muintir.ie.</i></p><p>Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. </p></reply>

A copy was also provided to the family of the young man who died in the road traffic incident and subsequently published by GSOC.</p>  <p>  It is important that I remind the Deputies that there is still an on-going GSOC investigation and I do not want to say anything that might be considered to prejudice or interfere with that investigation.</p>  <p>  The observations that have been provided in the report into improvements that could be made are currently being considered by my officials.  However, I can inform the Deputies that there have been developments already undertaken which should begin to address deficiencies identified in the report.  In relation to all Garda&iacute; being aware of the information which is available to victims, this has been clarified in the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  It specifies the list of information which all victims must be given by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when they first come in contact with a victim.  The Act also specifies a long list of information which a victim may opt to receive during the progress of a case. </p>  <p>  There is also an onus on the DPP to provide information where it is requested by a victim of crime, a family member of a victim in a fatal case, or a solicitor acting on behalf of either of the aforementioned.  In relation to requesting information from the DPP in respect of a decision not to prosecute, since late 2015 a person can ask the DPP for a summary of reasons for a decision not to prosecute through the Victim Liaison Unit.</p>  <p>  If that person is not satisfied with the reasons offered, they can ask the DPP to review the decision.  Such requests are limited to requesting information concerning decisions not to prosecute made on or after 16 November 2015 and in fatal cases, where the death occurred on or after 22 October 2008.</p>  <p>  On a general note, the Deputies should be aware that it is the role of the prosecuting authority to bring to the attention of the court any convictions, bail or court orders of which the court needs to be aware prior to reaching a decision on the case before the court. </p>  <p>  There is in place an information sharing platform between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service which transmits electronically the outcomes of District Court cases from the Courts Service Criminal Case Tracking system (CCTS) to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Pulse system.  There are plans in place to extend this exchange to other courts in due course.   </p>  <p>  As regards cross-border information sharing, the Deputies will be aware of the close relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and the importance that is attached to cooperation and information-sharing, be it on a police-to-police basis or through other formal mechanisms.  Clearly that principle of the importance of information-sharing should apply to all situations where it is appropriate and practicable to do so.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will appreciate, the comments made by GSOC encompass a number of matters across many agencies.  These matters are being reviewed by officials from my Department and it is my hope that any deficiencies identified by the report will be addressed without delay.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  In relation to Roscrea Garda Station it should be noted that station designations or status is a matter for the office of Deputy Commissioner Policing and Security, in conjunction with District and Divisional Officers, having regard to the policing requirements of the area and the surrounding communities.  As Minister I have no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Tipperary Division was 398 of whom 20 are assigned to Roscrea Garda Station.  The strength of Roscrea Garda Station in 2008 and in 2013 was 20 and 19 resprectively.  There are also 16 Garda Reserves and 41 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.  </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide of whom 44 members have been assigned to the Tipperary Division.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting this Friday.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years.  This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner recently launched a new recruitment drive with a closing date of 7 June.  Successful candidates from this new competition are expected to enter the Garda College in Q2 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the Tipperary Division as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. </p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015. </p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (SI No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016.  These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the DSS and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  The Director is also working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible.  There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations.</p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  My Department has received an outline implementation plan from the Director which contains monthly milestones for realisation of the objective of an active DSS.  As time goes on, every effort will be made by all sides to achieve tightening of the timeframes where possible and the situation will continue to be monitored closely by the Steering Group.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Budget provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South Division was 533 of whom 184 are assigned to Tallaght Garda Station.  There are also 17 Garda Reserves and 36 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  It is important to appreciate that the increased specialisation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na means the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to various divisions does not include those assigned to various special bureaus or units and, of course, those Garda&iacute; who are also undertaking critical policing work such as the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  More than 120 extra Garda&iacute; were assigned to the specialist units within special crime operations since 2017 alone.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.  </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 136 of whom have been assigned to the DMR South Division with 51 of these assigned to Tallaght Garda Station. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting this Friday.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years.  This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner recently launched a new recruitment drive with a closing date of 7 June.  Successful candidates from this new competition are expected to enter the Garda College in the second quarter of 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the DMR South Division as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. </p></reply>

Section 2(4A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 43(c) of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides for joint guardianship for a father who is not married to the mother of the child and has cohabited with the mother for not less than 12 consecutive months.  This 12 month period must include a period, occurring at any time after the birth of the child, of not less than three months during which both the mother and father have lived with the child.  This provision came into operation on 18 January 2016. </p>  <p>  In addition, a father who is not married to the child's mother and does not satisfy the cohabitation requirements may become a guardian if the parents jointly make a statutory declaration appointing him as a guardian.  It is also open to the father at any stage to make an application to court for guardianship of the child under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964. </p>  <p>  During the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill through the Oireachtas, my predecessor gave consideration to the establishment of a Central Register for Statutory Declarations of guardianship.  While considering that such a centralised repository may have some value, she was concerned that it should not become or be perceived as a necessary step in the acquisition of guardianship.  She considered that the existing statutory declaration mechanism to make certain parents guardians was readily accessible, cheap and straightforward, and the introduction of guardianship for fathers who satisfy the cohabitation requirement would widen the cohort of fathers who would have joint guardianship. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that there are issues concerning security, data protection, data management and the financial implications of creating a new registration system which would need to be addressed before such a centralised register could be established.</p>  <p>  Another issue that would require careful consideration is that if a system is created whereby failure to register a statutory declaration could mean that a person would not be a guardian, this could have the entirely unintended consequence of making guardianship more difficult to obtain than it is at present. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility for the Civil Registration Acts.  The Deputy may be aware that section 17 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 provides for the appointment of registrars in each registration area to carry out functions under that Act such as the registration of births and deaths.  The creation of a new post of a Central Registrar to maintain a record of statutory declarations of guardianship would require specific provision in primary legislation.  The creation of such a post would seem unnecessary in view of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004, including providing for the taking and receiving of statutory declarations in relation to guardianship.  Section 27A of the Civil Registration Act 2004 (as inserted by section 97 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that a registrar may, during the period of 14 days immediately following the date on which the birth of a child is registered or re-registered, take and receive a statutory declaration of guardianship made under section 2(4)(e) or 6B(4)(c) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in respect of a child. </p>  <p>  No provision of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 relating to donor assisted human reproduction (DAHR) are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  For example, statutory declarations cannot be made under section 6B(4)(c) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in respect of children born as a result of DAHR until the provisions of the 2015 Act relating to DAHR have been commenced by the Minister for Health.  The commencement of other sections of Part 9 is dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced.  My Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.</p></reply>

It is important to say that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertake a wide variety of roles that require different skill sets and different kinds of training including, for example, in relation to child protection, crime scene examination, cybercrime and so forth. It is not necessary for every member to have specialist knowledge of every area of policing. In the case of advanced driving skills, not all members are required to drive on a daily basis or to have the capacity to respond emergency response calls in a high speed vehicle.  </p><p>Responsibility for training lies with the Garda College and the Divisional Continuing Professional Development Schools under the overall responsibility of the Executive Director for Human Resources and People Development and I am informed by the Garda authorities that following a review of its driver training programmes in 2009, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na introduced a five level suite of competency based driving (CBD) courses with each level specifically catering for the required knowledge base, skill set and operational requirements of members undergoing the relevant training. The review was informed by the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s report into roads policing. I understand that CBD Level 3 is of three weeks duration and specifically designed for Garda&iacute; assigned to the Specialist Units concentrating on the competencies necessary to drive Garda vehicles and carry out all driving emergency response and vehicle stopping relevant to the roles of the Specialist Units. While there is no set date for the next CBD3 training programme, the Commissioner has informed me that this will be facilitated in the third quarter of this year subject to operational demand.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that under this Government's programme of accelerated recruitment, just under 1,800 new recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  I am informed by the Commissioner that this welcome increase in the strength of the Garda rank together with some 2,000 new vehicles coming on stream in the period 2013 to 2017 has resulted in a continuous demand for driver training courses. </p><p>I am advised that Garda management are conducting a review to identify how the delivery of the current driver training system can be improved. I understand that consultations have taken place with the PSNI and other police services to identify best practice with regard to models of training. Pending the outcome of this review I am advised that places on driving courses will continue to be allocated on a scheduled basis with priority being given where there is an immediate operational demand for drivers in a Division or Unit.</p><p>As CBD3 training is specifically geared toward the Specialist Units, for the Deputy's information I have set out in the table the total number of garda&iacute; who successfully completed CBD3 training, in each of the years 2016 and 2017 and up to 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available.</p><p><b><i>Number of Garda&iacute; who successfully completed CBD3 Driver Training in 2016 - 2018</i></b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th></th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018*</th></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>41</td><td>83</td><td>45</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 30 April 2018</p></reply>

The conditions are that the applicant must:</p>  <p>  - be of full age, or a minor born in the State,</p>  <p>  - be of good character,</p>  <p>  - have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to four years,</p>  <p>  - intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation,</p>  <p>  - have, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows -</p>  <p>  (i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and (ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</p>  <p>  Section 15A provides that, notwithstanding the above, where the application is based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the requirements are, inter alia, that the couple are married or civil partners to each other for a period of at least 3 years and are living together and, immediately before the date of application, have a period of one year's continuous residence in the island of Ireland and, during the preceding four years, have a further period amounting to 2 years (i.e. 3 years in total).  Section 15A(2) provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion waive some of the conditions in relation to an application from a spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen if he is satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.  </p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. The granting of Irish citizenship may have implications regarding any citizenship already held by applicants therefore appropriate research is advised with the authorities in the applicant's originating jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation, along with the relevant application forms and guidance notes, is available on the INIS website at ww.inis.gov.ie.</p></reply>

The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions Order) 2016 (S.I. No. 12 of 2016) commenced the bulk of the Act with effect from 18 January 2016.  That Commencement Order brought provisions of Parts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Act into operation.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 355 of 2017) commenced part of section 47(c) of the Act with effect from 31 July 2017 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 474 of 2017) commenced provisions of the Act relating to adoption by civil partners and cohabiting couples with effect from 2 November 2017. </p>  <p>  Part 10 of the Act, which amended the Passports Act 2008, was commenced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2015. </p>  <p>  Part 11 of the Act, which related to adoption, was not commenced and was repealed by section 2(2) of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which came into operation on 19 October 2017, as provided for by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 443 of 2017). The provisions in Part 11 have been incorporated into the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.  </p>  <p>  Section 177 of the Act which amends section 2 of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 has not yet been commenced. Following adoption of the 34th amendment to the Constitution and its subsequent legislative changes, my Department identified a lacuna in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits. To address this lacuna, my Department has prepared draft legislative proposals that will amend section 177 to will afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, cohabiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender.</p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.  </p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts by the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  That Bill will provide for the establishment of an Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority which will, among other things, undertake certain functions under Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. </p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Act provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced and my Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware both Henry Street and Roxboro Road Garda Districts form part of the Limerick Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Limerick Division was 565, of whom 309 and 136 were assigned to Henry Street and Roxboro Road Garda Districts respectively. There are also 27 Garda Reserves and 53 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 53 members have been assigned to the Limerick Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting this Friday. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner recently launched a new recruitment drive with a closing date of 7 June. Successful candidates from this new competition are expected to enter the Garda College in Q2 2019.</p><p>In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the Limerick Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out below in tabular form the number of Garda&iacute; allocated to the Henry Street and Roxboro Road Garda Districts in each of the years 2007 to 2017 and to date in 2018, as of 30 April 2018 the latest date for which figures are currently available, as supplied by the Commissioner.</p><p><b>Strength of Henry Street and Roxboro Garda Districts 2007-2018*</b><table><tr><th>District </th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018*</th></tr><tr><td>Henry Street</td><td>330</td><td>358</td><td>363</td><td>376</td><td>363</td><td>341</td><td>329</td><td>314</td><td>311</td><td>317</td><td>313</td><td>309</td></tr><tr><td>Roxboro Road</td><td>134</td><td>139</td><td>141</td><td>140</td><td>148</td><td>137</td><td>134</td><td>129</td><td>124</td><td>125</td><td>129</td><td>136</td></tr></table></p><p>*Up to 30 April 2018 </p></reply>

Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.</p><p>Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's identified operational needs and priorities. Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no role in that regard.  </p><p>Under the grant-aid scheme launched by my Department last year to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas, eligible groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.</p><p>I am very anxious to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme.  Full details of the grant aid package including guidelines, application forms, code of practice and other relevant documentation are all available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie. Support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address available for this purpose - communitycctv@justice.ie. In addition, the criteria for the installation and operation by authorised persons of the CCTV system in specified areas has been established. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Policing Authority, under section 38(11) of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, is required to issue guidelines to the Garda Commissioner concerning the supervision and control by the Commissioner of the monitoring of CCTV by authorised persons.  I can confirm to the Deputy that while the Authority has not issued guidelines under section 38(11) as yet, my Department is engaging with the Authority on the issue.</p><p>As mentioned above my Department has issued a Code of Practice For Community based CCTV systems which is available from our website at . This provides guidance to local authority groups and informs them of their legal and data protection obligations.</p></reply>

To collate this data would require a manual examination of a large number of individual prisoner records. Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort, which could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that special arrangements are in place for prisoners who have been identified as being at risk, whereby they are placed in either a Safety Observation Cell or Close Supervision Cell on special observation and checked every 15 minutes. Prisoners who may have received bad news (for example a bereavement) are also closely monitored. There is a clear distinction between Safety Observation Cells which are used only for medical health reasons and Close Supervision Cells which are used for managing violent, disruptive or distressed prisoners.</p>  <p>  The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors, including the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her.</p>  <p>  Under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007 a Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  In addition a smaller number of prisoners may have their regimes restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67). </p>  <p>  The Prison Rules 2007 provide that the imposition of a restricted regime is closely monitored by the Irish Prison Service and the status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed.  The collation of a Quarterly Census of Restricted Regime Prisoners commenced in 2013. This census is published on its website (www.irishprisons.ie) and includes details on a prison by prison basis of the number of prisoners on 22 and 23 hour lock-up each quarter.</p></reply>

I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that considerable efforts were made to facilitate prisoner voting prior to the Referendum date. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service complies with the provisions of the Electoral Amendment Act 2006 in the context of facilitating prisoner voting in general and local elections and referenda, through ensuring:</p>  <p>  Information on voting is contained in the induction packs presented to all prisoners on committal. Prison officials have worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in producing an information leaflet for prisoners on prisoner voting. This leaflet is widely available in all prisons.</p>  <p>  All prisons have a stock of ballot application forms available to prisoners on request.</p>  <p>  All prisons have a designated official who has been appointed under the provisions of the Electoral Amendment Act 2006 with responsibility for the facilitation of prisoner postal voting.</p>  <p>  Prisoners have access to a range of media forms including newspapers, radio and TV through which they are kept informed of current affairs. The extensive educational facilities available in the various institutions also play a role in this process of increasing prisoner awareness of political developments. Both the library service and the educational services in the prisons play a valuable role in increasing awareness among prisoners of their rights in this area.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Caherciveen Garda station is open to the public from 9am to 5pm Monday to Sunday.  It is important to remember that while the Garda station in question has reduced opening hours to the public, it is a functioning Garda station on a 24 hour basis.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division which ensures local Garda management has the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational needs and address critical issues as they arise taking account of, amongst other factors,  the incidence of crime and crime trends in each District in the Division.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware Caherciveen forms part of the Killarney Garda District.  I am further informed that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available the strength of the District was 107, including one Superintendent District officer based in District Headquarters, in Killarney Garda Station, and 18 Garda&iacute; assigned to Caherciveen Garda Station.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 29 to the Kerry Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting this Friday. Furthermore, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner recently launched a new recruitment drive with a closing date of 7 June. Successful candidates from this new competition are expected to enter the Garda College in the second quarter of 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda District, including the Killarney District as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.</p></reply>

The &lsquo;P19 System&rsquo; refers to the disciplinary system in place under the Prisons Act, 2007, which allows Governors deal with prisoners who have committed breaches of the Prison Rules and allows Governors impose sanctions where a breach of the Rules has been proven to take place. Such sanction(s) are normally in the format of loss of certain privileges such as reduced phone calls, reduced visits, prohibition on the use of the Gym, prohibition on use of the Tuck Shop etc., for defined periods of time. At the higher end of the scale, Governors can also reduce remission, which in effect lengthens the period of time a prisoner is required to remain in prison.</p></reply>

The group was tasked in particular to address the needs of children and families as highlighted in the report published by the Irish Penal Reform Trust entitled &lsquo;Picking up the Pieces: The rights and needs of children and families affected by imprisonment.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  A key element of this is the provision of appropriate child and family friendly visiting facilities.</p>  <p>  Prison Visitor Centres, which are partly funded by the Irish Prison Service, play a vital role in humanising the visiting experience of prisoner families through the provision of refreshments, befriending and child play services. There are visitor centres in the West Dublin, Mountjoy and Midlands campus and they are run by the St Vincent de Paul. </p>  <p>  The West Dublin Campus visitor centres provides a hospitality/family support service which includes information provision on a wide range of issues. There are childcare areas which provide toys, arts and crafts. A similar provision is made at Mountjoy and the Midlands. </p>  <p>  Bedford Row operates a family friendly hospitality Centre at Limerick Prison. This is part funded by the Irish Prison Service and includes the dispensing of refreshments, the giving out of play material to children and also befriending and information provision. Targeted work with prisoners children is also a focus of the work of the Centre. </p>  <p>  Cork and Castlerea have smaller visitor centres which are run by local community groups.  Castlerea has recently constructed a new visitor area, which includes enhanced family visit spaces. </p>  <p>  All prisons have designated areas to facilitate family visits which include a family friendly space, round tables or family seating and access to play materials. </p>  <p>  In addition temporary release for access/visits to children for family occasions is regularly approved in most prisons. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service targets family friendly training to &lsquo;front of house&rsquo; staff, which aims to improve staff awareness of the effects of imprisonment on families and allows staff to appropriately support families and children visiting prisons. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service also provide training in Children First to all staff, which ensures that any child protection and welfare concerns are dealt with appropriately.  Each prison has a Child Safeguarding Statement, as required under the Children First Act 2015 and one or more Designated Liaison Persons, who are the main point of contact in each prison for child welfare. </p>  <p>  All of our prisons facilitate visits on Saturdays to take account of the needs of families visiting persons in custody. Sunday visits are allowed at the two Open Centres and at Cloverhill. </p>  <p>  The Families and Imprisonment Group carried out surveys in 2018 at Visitor Centres and also engaged in Family Forums, in order to consult with families and children visiting prisons.  The learning from these will be used to further develop family and child friendly visiting facilities in all prisons.</p></reply>

Its recommendations have implications for a number of Government Departments and services. </p><p>My Department has since published three progress reports on the implementation of its 173 recommendations; the first in June 2016, the second in February of 2017 and a third and final report in July of 2017. All three reports are available to view on my Department's website www.justice.ie.  </p><p>The final progress report shows that 133 recommendations have been reported as fully implemented and a further 36 are in progress or partially implemented. This represents a 98% full or partial implementation rate.</p><p>The Working Paper dated December 2017, referred to by the Deputy, acknowledges that considerable progress has been made, and in particular highlights as &ldquo;significant improvements&rdquo; developments such as the introduction of the Single Procedure in the International Protection Act, 2015; general improvements in living conditions; and the Government&rsquo;s decision to opt-in to the Reception Conditions Directive.</p><p>The improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been significant over recent years. These include the implementation of self or communal catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres. As a result of this initiative, over 1,500 residents are now able to prepare meals of their own choosing.  In addition, there have been improvements to a number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches to provide for &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities and the introduction of teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.  Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.</p><p>Following on from the McMahon Report, a Standards Advisory Group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of McMahon and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State. The Standards will meet the minimum standards set out in the Recast Reception Conditions Directive and EASO Guidance on Reception Conditions: Operational Standards and Indicators and will also take account of national developments in the provision of services to those in the protection process. They will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of  employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty. The group is comprised of members from a range of organisations supporting refugees as well as staff from a number of government Departments and will deliver a Working Document in September 2018 following widespread consultation.</p><p>The Government approved an opt into the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive (2013/33/EU). The decision to opt-in to the Directive will bring Ireland into line with our EU partners and place the entire system on a legislative basis, which will be subject to EU oversight. This is a significant and positive measure, not only in addressing the issue of labour market access, but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision. By opting into the Directive, another important recommendation of the Justice McMahon report will be implemented bringing Ireland into line with the European Union norms.  <b><i></i></b></p><p>I remain fully committed to working with all stakeholders, some of whom will have differing views on the extent of implementation of some recommendations, to ensure the continuing implementation of a wide range of reforms in this area, including those recommended by the Justice McMahon report.</p></reply>

The building is in the ownership of the Courts Service and, since that time, the Courts Service has offered the courthouse for alternative public use at no cost to Cork County Council and to the Office of Public Works. The Courts Service has further advised that there has been no request for the building to be transferred to another public body to date. </p>  <p>  In the event that the building is not required for use by another public body, the Courts Service will consider the sale of the building. In the meantime the building has been made available for use on Culture Nights and for Arts Festivals.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that remedial works were undertaken on the building in 2013 and more recently repair works were undertaken following Storm Ophelia.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-12a.1365.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061200082#WRZ03000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 522 and 523 together.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the carrying on and managing generally the administration and business of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including arranging for the recruitment, training and appointment of the Reserve members. Further, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in these matters. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Reserve on the 30 April 2018 was 562, 27 of whom are attached to the Limerick Division. It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways: firstly, since 2014, 246 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointments Service (PAS) have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. </p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. </p><p>With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track, it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves last March. That competition attracted 2,394 applicants of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS. These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office. The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors, including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons. It is expected that the first of the successful candidates will commence training in the Garda College in the coming months.</p><p>In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used optimally to support effective policing. To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority to be completed in the first half of the year as set out in the Policing Plan 2018. </p><p>As a first step, the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement. This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens. This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground and engaging with local communities.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the tables the number of Reserves in each of the years requested by the Deputy in tabular form. I also include a table setting out the total number of Garda Reserves who have commenced training as a Garda Trainee from 2007 up to May 2018. Please note, that due to the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 there was no recruitment of Garda Trainees from 2010 until 2014. </p><p><b>Garda Reserve 2006 -

No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin. The remaining provisions of the Act for which the Minister for Justice and Equality has responsibility have not yet been commenced.<br /><br />The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</td><td>The key preparations are being put in place to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The Director, who was appointed in October 2017, is also working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations.  <br /><br />Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible. The Department has received an outline implementation plan from the Director which contains monthly milestones for realisation of the objective of an active DSS.  As time goes on, every effort will be made by all sides to achieve tightening of the timeframes where possible and the situation will continue to be monitored closely by the Steering Group.　<br /><br /> <br /><br />While it is not possible at the moment to provide an exact timeframe for the full commencement of the 2015 Act, every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.</td></tr><tr><td>Children and Family Relationships Act 2015</td><td>Parts 2 and 3 of the Act (Sections 4 to 42 inclusive) which provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR). <br /><br />Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  <br /><br />Part 9 of the Act (sections 92 to 99 inclusive) provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  <br /><br />Part 11 of the Act (Sections 101 to 134 inclusive) in relation to adoption has not been commenced. This Part of the Act was repealed by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017.<br /><br />Section 177 of the Act in relation to amendment of the Adoptive Leave act 1995</td><td>The commencement of Parts 2 and 3, relating to donor-assisted human reproduction, is a matter for the Department of Health.<br /><br />Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3 and cannot be commenced until those Parts are commenced.<br /><br />Some sections of Part 9 cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced. The Department is liaising with the Department of Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.<br /><br />Part 11 relating to adoption has now been repealed by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017.<br /><br />Following adoption of the 34th amendment to the Constitution and its subsequent legislative changes, my Department identified a lacuna in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits.<br /><br />To address this lacuna, my Department has prepared draft legislative proposals that will amend the Adoptive Leave Act and will afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, co-habiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender.</td></tr><tr><td>Civil Debt (Procedures) Act 2015</td><td>Entire Act </td><td>Commencement requires systems to be put in place in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to handle deductions from social welfare payments, and Rules of Court to enable the District Court to deal with the enforcement of court orders (abolition of imprisonment for debtors) and in respect of the processes for attachment of earnings and for the relevant District Court hearings under the Act.  <br /><br />Contact is being maintained with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to commencement matters.</td></tr><tr><td>Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017</td><td>Whole Act</td><td>Enacted on 15 November 2017. <br /><br />Rules of Court have to be prepared in relation to the provisions of the Act regarding periodic payments orders before they can be commenced. These rules of court are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.<br /><br />Commencement of Part 4 of the Act regarding open disclosure of patient safety incidents is a matter for the Department of Health.</td></tr><tr><td>Court of Appeal Act 2014</td><td>Section 73 insofar as it relates to certain enactments specified in Schedule 1 to the Act </td><td>The Schedule in question provides for the repeal of certain enactments.  The repeals yet to be commenced concern the Court of Criminal Appeal and cannot be commenced until such time as all cases before that Court have been brought to a conclusion. <br /><br />Final confirmation is awaited from the Courts Service as to the timing of the Commencement SI and it is anticipated that this matter can be brought to a conclusion within a matter of weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014</td><td>Sections 67(2)(e); 72(2)(f) (insofar as this paragraph relates to Chapter 2 of Part 12) and 110-121.</td><td>It was necessary to defer commencement of these provisions, which mainly relate to international cooperation by way of automated searching, comparison and exchange of DNA data or dactyloscopic data, until required logistical arrangements to facilitate this have been finalised.  These arrangements include, inter alia, piloting and testing the DNA Database System for international data exchange and obtaining EU Council approval before personal data can be provided to other Member States. </td></tr><tr><td>Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Act 2015</td><td>Sections 24 and 34 (in so far as S. 65(4A) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 (15/1994) inserted by that section relates to S.60D of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 (7/2008))</td><td>Both sections refer to the provision of financial penalties.  Provisions dealing with financial penalties have not yet commenced.<br /><br />Section 24 deals with mutual recognition of fines and requires a designation of the appropriate authority by the Minister, which is under consideration.</td></tr><tr><td>Criminal Justice Act 2017</td><td>Sections 2, 4, 11 and 12<br /><br />Section 7</td><td>Awaiting updates to the Garda Custody Regulations prior to commencement.<br /><br />Section 7 of the new Criminal Justice Act 2017 amends Section 6B of the Bail Act 1997, as inserted by Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 concerning the electronic monitoring of persons on bail. </td></tr><tr><td>Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017</td><td>Part 5 (Sections 28 to 32):  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Section 52:<br /><br /><br /><br /></td><td>Part 5 was drafted to update the existing incest laws in order to equalise the penalty for incest by a female with that which applies to incest by a male (i.e., life imprisonment).  At Report stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the section to increase the penalty for incest by a female was deleted. The General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018 provides that the penalty for incest for a male and a female be equalised at 10 years. Part 5 will not be commenced until the provisions of this Bill have been considered by the Oireachtas.<br /><br />This section provides for an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act 2010 and is consequential to Part 5 of the Bill relating to incest.</td></tr><tr><td>Criminal Justice (Suspended Sentences of Imprisonment) Act 2017</td><td>Entire Act</td><td>District Court Rules required to facilitate commencement of the Act are being finalised.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Protection Act 2018</td><td>Section 7(3) (insofar as it relates to the revocation of the Data Protection Act 1988 (Section 5(1)(d)) (Specification) Regulations 1993 (S.I. No. 95 of 1993), insofar as  those Regulations relate to the functions of the Central Bank of Ireland to which Regulation 3 of those Regulations applies);<br /><br />Sections 25 and 176(b) <br /><br />Section 30</td><td>Not yet commenced pending the making of Regulations under Section 60 of the Act.<br /><br />Not yet commenced as the necessary procedures have to be put in place to give the Data Protection Commission its own Vote.<br /><br />The Office of the Attorney General has advised my Department that insofar as Section 30 purports to make it an offence for any company or corporate body to process the personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing or profiling, such a prohibition appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1)(f), read in conjunction with Recital (47). Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). Since commencement of Section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, I have requested my Department to clarify the matter with the European Commission.</td></tr><tr><td>Domestic Violence Act 2018</td><td>Whole Act</td><td>Enacted on 8 May 2018.<br /><br />Rules of Court have to be prepared in relation to the provisions of the Act regarding civil domestic violence orders before they can be commenced. Forms and documents relating to domestic violence orders on Courts Service IT systems will need updating.<br /><br />The commencement of the provisions of the Act regarding new criminal offences of forced marriage and coercive control, and the provision making the relationship between defendant and victim an aggravating factor in sentencing for certain offences can proceed independently of commencement of the provisions relating to civil domestic violence orders.<br /><br />The Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarding the commencement of the provisions that repeal the current exemptions that allow persons under the age of 18 to marry.</td></tr><tr><td>Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014 <br /><br /> (No. 26 of 2014)</td><td>Section 35 (a),(b) and (c) and Section 36</td><td>Pending finalisation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of arrangements for the transfer of the immigration registration function to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS)</td></tr><tr><td>Legal Services Regulation Act 2015</td><td>Part 1 &ndash; Section 5.<br /><br />Part 2 &ndash; paragraphs (c) to (f) of Section 13(2), Section 31, Section 33 and Sections 35 &amp;amp; 36.<br /><br />Parts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.<br /><br />Part 8 &ndash; Sections 99 to 117 and Section 121<br /><br />Parts 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</td><td>Parts 1 and 2 of the Act were commenced as necessary to support the setting-up and appointment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which held its first meeting on 26 October 2016. During its first year the Authority, under Sections 118 to 120 as commenced, also completed a series of time-bound public consultations and reports on new legal business models. The Authority is now engaged in the essential planning and capacity building for the roll-out of its remaining functions under the Act which will be supported by the Department of Justice and Equality in the commencement of the relevant provisions concerned. Part 15 does not fall under the remit of the Authority. </td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016</td><td>Section 2(1)(b)(iii)</td><td>The Section cannot be commenced until the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 is progressed through the Oireachtas and is enacted.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-12a.1371.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061200082#WRZ03700"><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10th September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  Under this programme the Government pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State including through the recently announced IRPP Humanitarian Assistance Programme (IHAP), which will provide for the admission of up to 530 immediate family members of Irish citizens, persons with Convention refugee or subsidiary protection status and persons with programme refugee status.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of the IRPP for resettling Syrian refugees requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE, Tusla and Local Authorities are represented on the national Taskforce which oversees delivery of the programme.  In general, coordination is ensured via the IRPP which is part of the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) within my Department. OPMI is the primary entity responsible for delivering resettlement via a range of statutory and non-statutory agencies. It has overseen the humanitarian resettlement programmes run by Ireland since they were established in 2000.  </p>  <p>  My Department is mobilising European Union Funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) in support of Ireland's resettlement efforts, including to fund supports provided through local authorities to the refugees.  Local authorities play a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through the provision of housing and the implementation of a process carried out by an "implementing partner" with expertise in community integration and relevant supports.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Irish Red Cross which was assigned responsibility by the Government for administering public pledges of support, especially in the area of accommodation.  Its case workers and support team work closely with IRPP and refugees to find suitable accommodation options.  </p>  <p>  Programme refugees have the right to work in Ireland.  Supports are provided under the auspices of the programme to enable them to be in a position to secure employment.  These include:</p>  <p>  - The IRPP liaises with the Department of Education and Skills and the local Education and Training Board in each catchment area to ensure that groups receive a Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme and to facilitate access to education.   </p>  <p>  - Free childcare is provided wherever possible to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme in their Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC). </p>  <p>  - Local service providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the EROCs to provide services and information and to support and befriend the asylum seekers or refugees. </p>  <p>  Increasingly, the IRPP is focusing on initiatives which assist with labour market activation for refugees and is working with the Irish Red Cross and other bodies to facilitate access to employment. Various initiatives are also developing in the educational sphere.</p>  <p>  With regard to integration more generally, the Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published on 7 February 2017, offers a blueprint for Government action to promote the integration of all migrants who are legally in the State, including refugees, for the period to 2020.  It sees integration as a two-way process involving action by migrants and non-migrants alike.  The Strategy comprises 76 specific actions under a number of themes to be implemented by Government Departments and Agencies, the business sector, employers, local authorities and community and voluntary sector organisations.  The Employment and Pathways to Work theme contains actions designed to enable migrants, including refugees, to participate in employment.  Among other actions, the Strategy requires Government Departments and agencies to address integration in strategy statements; to ensure appropriate, regular engagement with NGOs representing migrant groups; and to provide intercultural awareness training. </p>  <p>  The strategy includes targeted initiatives to promote migrant entrepreneurship, to encourage migrants into the Civil Service and onto State boards and to improve English language provision in education and training.  It is accompanied by a Communities Integration Fund which provides funding for 131 initiatives by community organisations aimed at promoting migrant integration and facilitating social inclusion at the local level.  </p>  <p>  The strategy is available on the website of the Office for Promotion for Migrant Integration at www.integration.ie. </p>  <p>  It is my firm intention that the model of integration and support is one which will evolve and develop over the coming months and years with a view to offering refugees increasing opportunities to enhance their own lives.  It is for this reason I am examining initiatives such as community sponsorship to support the long-term integration process. </p></reply>

This is a long-standing principle of our system of justice. The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).  Any information in relation to possible criminal acts should be provided directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation. The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP, who is completely independent in carrying out her functions.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the Courts, subject only to the Constitution and the law, are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the conduct of any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge. It is not open to me to comment or intervene in any way in relation to how particular proceedings are conducted or, indeed, on the outcome of such proceedings.</p>  <p>  If someone is not satisfied with the manner in which their complaints have been handled by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, then it is open to them to contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Office (GSOC).  GSOC, as you are no doubt aware, is the independent body charged with receiving complaints from the public concerning members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is not open to me to intervene in this case in the manner the person in question is seeking. It is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, specifically the Garda Commissioner and his management team, who are responsible for investigating all forms of alleged criminality in the State in the first instance and not the Minister for Justice and Equality. Accordingly, I cannot accede to this particular meeting request.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, it is, of course, open to the person in question to seek independent legal advice in relation to their concerns, if they so wish.</p></reply>

This incorporates both the use of in-house staff, including solicitor staff, working in law centres and the referral of cases to private solicitors on a panel. </p><p>The service provision is split between two units, the Refugee Documentation Centre (RDC), and the International Protection Unit (IPU). Since May 2017, eight new staff have been engaged to increase the provision of these services. The Deputy should note that, while one hire was to cover maternity leave and another was an intern post, these new hires are in addition to the 13 indicated in the response to Parliamentary Question No. 88 of 17 May 2017.  These are broken down as below: <table><tr><th><div>Unit</div></th><th><div>Grade</div></th><th><div>FTE</div></th></tr><tr><td>Refugee Documentation Centre</td><td>Executive Officer</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clerical Officer</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clerical Officer</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Intern (for a period of 6 weeks)</td><td>1.0 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>International Protection Unit</td><td>Managing Solicitor Grade I</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Solicitor Grade III</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Solicitor Grade III</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Legal Clerk (Maternity   Cover)</td><td>1.0</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy should also note that the Board provides legal services in relation to a range of important civil issues.  While the Board is developing specialisation in its staff, it also wishes to ensure flexibility in order to address areas of particular demand or priority at a point in time.  Therefore additional staff covering those broader civil law issues can also be engaged in international protection cases.</p></reply>

Appeals in respect of negative first instance protection recommendations are considered by the statutorily independent International Protection Appeals Tribunal, which replaced the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).</p><p>The fact that scheduling times have lengthened in the IPO can be attributed to a number of reasons. </p><p>Firstly, as part of the transition arrangements for the new single procedure process, the IPO was required to take responsibility for the processing of over 3,000 cases which were not finalised by the former ORAC or RAT. These applications reverted for processing under the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act and added significantly to the IPO caseload. All of these transitional cases had to be contacted individually by the IPO to inform them of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act and how the transitional provisions would affect their applications. All applicants received comprehensive documentation including a new Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) which, on return, had to be translated and associated with the relevant files. This process meant that the IPO was not fully up and running in terms of interviewing until the second quarter of 2017. The concentration on the elimination of the inherited backlog, in line with the system of prioritisation agreed with the UNHCR, has also reduced the ability of the IPO to address more current cases.</p><p>Secondly, there was a 30% increase in applications for international protection in 2017 (including EU relocation applicants) which has put additional pressure on the processing system. In addition, applications for international protection have also increased in 2018 (to end May) by over 30% as compared with the same period in 2017.</p><p>Thirdly, the 2015 Act substantially changed the processing arrangements for the consideration of applications for international protection and for permission to remain decisions by introducing a more comprehensive single procedure. On the one hand, this development has, of course,  resulted in a more streamlined system enabling all the grounds for a person to remain in the State to be determined as part of one process in the IPO. However, compared with the jurisdiction at first instance of the former ORAC, which considered applications for refugee status alone, caseworkers in the IPO are required to investigate applications on the basis of three comprehensive elements namely; whether the applicant is a refugee or, if not; whether the applicant is eligible for subsidiary protection or, if not and thirdly, are there grounds to grant a person humanitarian permission to remain in the State.  While considering all aspects together does, of course, create economies of scale in investigating applications as part of a more streamlined single procedure process, the level of investigation required is more comprehensive and consequently more time consuming.  </p><p>In terms of progress to date, I can inform the Deputy that considerable work has been undertaken to get the new process up and running. For example, in terms of scheduling of interviews, the IPO scheduled over 2,400 single procedure interviews (including in respect of EU relocation cases) in 2017. In 2018 (to end May), some 1500 interviews have been scheduled.</p><p>In relation to recommendations/decisions, some 1,780<b></b>recommendations/decisions in respect of international protection and permission to remain were made by the IPO in 2017. This included some 750 recommendations in respect of the grant of international protection<i>.</i>In addition, some 1,634 recommendations/decisions have been made by the IPO in 2018 (to end May 2018).  This includes international protection recommendations (including EU relocation cases), permission to remain decisions and permission to remain reviews. For 2018, there were some 572 international protection grants and over 100 grants of permission to remain made by the IPO. All 2018 figures are provisional.</p><p>Based on current predictions, the IPO is in line to make some 3,500 recommendations and decisions in 2018. </p><p>Considerable additional resources have and are being allocated to the IPO to assist it in undertaking its statutory functions with a view to processing the volume of cases on hands as soon as possible. As at the beginning of June 2018, the current staffing complement in the IPO is 135. In addition, there are some 55 serving members of the IPO Case Processing Panel. To enable the IPO to carry out their functions to optimum effect and to assist in the reduction of caseloads, the current Case Processing Panel is being further expanded at the present time on the basis of public advertisement.</p><p>The resources assigned to the IPO, as well as work processes in that organisation, are being kept under ongoing review and additional resources will be allocated as these become available so that the cases on hand, both those applications preceding the commencement of the 2015 Act and the increased volume of new applications, are dealt with as quickly as possible and waiting times for those applying for international protection are reduced to the greatest possible extent. </p><p>It is recognised that currently many applicants for international protection are waiting longer than they should for their first instance interviews in the IPO and to have their cases decided.  While the structural causes of delays have been removed with the commencement of the International Protection Act, 2015, the main challenge now faced is the need to quickly eradicate the substantial number of cases carried over from the previous system.  As I indicated, these challenges are being addressed by deploying increased resources and a continual assessment and reform of the use of those resources and, having due regard to the requirements of the International Protection Act 2015.</p></reply>

Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.</p><p>Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's identified operational needs and priorities.  Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no role in that regard.</p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006).  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must&mdash;</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and </p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. </p><p>There are no plans to amend the relevant legislation in the manner suggested in the Deputy's question.</p><p>In that regard, it can be noted that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has confirmed to my Department that it is not querying and does not have any current concerns regarding the legislative underpinning of community CCTV systems.</p><p>A grant-aid scheme was launched by my Department last year to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas.  Full details of the grant aid package is all available to download from my Department's website - .  I invite interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this scheme and to contact the Department in the event with any queries in that regard.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the National Vetting Bureau works to ensure that the processing time for vetting applications is kept to the minimum necessary in order to ensure that the statutory obligation to receive a vetting disclosure prior to permitting any person to undertake relevant work or activities on behalf of an organisation can be facilitated without undue delay.</p>  <p>  The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the eVetting system is five working days for over 80% of vetting applications received.</p>  <p>  In certain cases, it is necessary to conduct further enquiries within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or with external agencies such as the Courts Service, Probation Service, Child and Family Agency, etc.  These enquiries may be conducted for many reasons, such as verification of identity, updating of incomplete records or establishing the outcomes of investigations.

The Board has supplied the financial analysis below, which is for general information purposes only, and is subject to a number of assumptions including level of demand and case profile.  </p><p>It should be noted that civil legal aid is not free in the vast majority of cases.  The contribution for which a person is liable will depend on their disposable income and capital assets.  Persons who receive civil legal services are generally obliged to pay a financial contribution of &euro;30 for legal advice and a further minimum contribution of &euro;130 if they require representation in court.  The Board has a discretionary facility to waive contributions in instances of undue hardship and certain circumstances for example, defence of District Court child care proceedings.</p><p>Using the contributions figure collected in 2017 (provisional figure &euro;1,647,517) as a base line, the table below sets out what the Board&rsquo;s estimated income in contributions would be if the legal aid contribution was reduced by the specified figures and the consequent loss of income that would accrue to the Board. </p><p>For the purposes of answering the Deputy&rsquo;s query, where the reduction referred to is greater than the contribution currently being collected, it has been reduced to zero.

The Lisbon Treaty extended this competence to cover foreign direct investment, as well as making the European Parliament a co-legislator alongside the Council on trade matters.  The European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries regarding trade agreements with non-EU countries.  Member States (in Council) approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are kept informed of developments as the negotiations proceed and have final approval at Council.</p>  <p>  The EU is currently negotiating a trade agreement with the four founding members of Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay).  If concluded an EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement would be the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date, four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.</p>  <p>  As with any Free Trade Agreement negotiations, Ireland, like all Member States, has defensive as well as offensive trade interests.  We are mindful of the cumulative impact of EU FTAs on specific sectors like agriculture and the challenges they face.  Officials from my Department continue to be engaged, through the Trade Policy Committee, in highlighting the importance of maintaining the balance between the EU&rsquo;s defensive and offensive interests.  Equally, when the Commission has reported on progress in these negotiations to Trade Ministers in Council, I have set out Ireland&rsquo;s key interests.  Furthermore insofar as our defensive interests in agriculture are concerned, both An Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine have also engaged with their counterparts.  </p>  <p>  The Commission may present some EU trade agreements as 'EU-only' meaning that all the policy areas they cover fall under the sole responsibility of the EU institutions.  Other agreements may be presented as 'mixed' where they have areas of shared responsibility between the EU and Member States.  Only at the conclusion of negotiations and when the Commission presents an Agreement to Council can an agreement be determined definitely as being 'EU-only' or &lsquo;mixed&rsquo;.  Were a deal to be concluded between the EU and Mercosur in 2018, the relevant text would proceed to so-called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;, and translation, a process which can take up to two years to complete.  The ratification process regarding individual trade agreements must be taken on a case-by-case basis depending on the issues comprehended in the final agreement.  Where appropriate, my Department seeks legal advice on the appropriate ratification process to follow in each case.</p>  <p>  Mixed agreements enter into force only once each individual EU Member State has approved it in line with its own National procedures.  As this process may take several years, the Council can decide to provisionally apply an agreement ('provisional application').  Provisional Application generally applies to those parts of the agreement over which the EU has exclusive competence.  The extent of EU only competence was addressed comprehensively in the 2017 Opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the EU-Singapore FTA case.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-12a.1476.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061200084#WRBB02000"><p>A key objective of the Programme for Partnership Government, from the perspective of my Department, is to provide a supportive environment for enterprise and employment and to deliver sustainable full employment. In the Programme, my Department was tasked with supporting a leap forward in the capacity and performance of our enterprise sector and delivering an environment that is conducive to the creation and maintenance of quality employment. We have set a target of 200,000 extra jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these to be in locations outside Dublin. The latest statistics show that employment continues to grow strongly:</p>  <p>  -  97,500 jobs were created between Q2 2016 and Q4 2017, bringing total employment to 2,225,100.</p>  <p>  -  Full time employment increased by 7.8% (from 1,632,900 to 1,761,800) from Q2 2016 to Q4 2017.</p>  <p>  -  Unemployment decreased nationally from 204,900 in Q2 2016 to 151,500 in Q4 2017, with the monthly unemployment rate now at 5.8% in May 2018. </p>  <p>  With regard to regional employment, the statistics are encouraging:</p>  <p>  -  From Q2 2016 to Q2 2017, employment outside of Dublin grew by 3.0% compared to a growth of 1.3% in Dublin.  </p>  <p>  -  Employment increased in all eight regions over the twelve month period to Q2 2017.</p>  <p>  -  The unemployment rate decreased in all regions from Q2 2016 &ndash; Q2 2017.</p>  <p>  -  Labour Force Survey data shows that 84% of the increase in employment in the year to Q2 2017 was outside Dublin.</p>  <p>IDA Ireland continues to work to attract foreign direct investment to Ireland. The agency created 10,684 net new jobs over the course of 2017, with every region in Ireland posting net gains in jobs.  At the end of 2017 there were 210,443 people working in IDA Ireland client companies, the highest in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s history.  This figure surpasses the five-year target of 209,000 which was set in 2015 in the &ldquo;Winning: Foreign Direct Investment&rdquo; strategy. The IDA is continuing to work towards other objectives set out in this strategy, especially that of increasing the level of investment by between 30% and 40% in each region outside Dublin by 2019. Strong progress was made in this respect in 2017, with 45% of IDA Ireland supported jobs created located outside Dublin. Through its Regional Property Programme, the IDA is also developing appropriate property solutions in designated regional locations to attract overseas investment.</p>  <p>  In the indigenous sector, 2017 was a very strong year for job creation among Enterprise Ireland clients with 19,332 new jobs created. 2017 resulted in the highest client employment in the history of the agency, highest net job creation in the history of the agency and the lowest number of job losses since 1998. There was positive net jobs growth in every county across the country, with 65% of new job creation outside of Dublin. Employment in Local Enterprise Office client companies now stands at 37,485 with 3,760 net new jobs were created in 2017. </p>  <p>My Department is focused on addressing the challenges that Brexit poses for business, and we established a dedicated Brexit Unit in 2016 to lead on the coordination of the Department&rsquo;s policy and operational responses to Brexit, including our approach to the negotiations within the EU and bilateral relations with the UK. In November 2017, we published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rdquo;. This paper summarises impacts of Brexit across key policy areas within the Department and outlines the policy and operational measures underway and planned by the Department and its Agencies to respond to Brexit, including supports available to companies to help them prepare for Brexit. The recently launched Agile Innovation Fund, launched in 2017, helps companies use innovation to mitigate risks posed by Brexit. Companies are already seeing that such initiatives increase business resilience and add value, whatever the full impacts of Brexit may be. We also provide regular input and advice to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on key issues for Ireland in the context of the negotiations including exit issues, transition, arrangements for framework for the future relationship.</p>  <p>  In relation to Trade, according to CSO merchandise trade and balance of payments data, total exports have increased by 58 percent since 2012 to &euro;283.7billion in 2017.  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification as well as ambitious targets for trade and investment. These include increasing our indigenous exports to reach &euro;26 billion by 2020 &ndash; up by 26% from 2015, generating 30,000 more jobs in tourism by 2020 and &euro;5 billion in overseas tourism revenues by 2025, and securing 900 new foreign direct investments in the period 2015-2019. In relation to Brexit, the target is to intensify and diversify 80% of indigenous export growth to 2020 to be outside of the UK market and maintain exports of at least &euro;7.5 billion to the UK. </p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets. In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit.  More recently, Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to alleviating pressures on household budgets and, in this context, the work of the Personal Injuries Commission, established in January 2017, will play an important role in helping to address the cost of motor insurance in Ireland, complementing the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group. The first report of the Commission was published in December 2017 and work is progressing on the Commission&rsquo;s final report, which will focus predominately on benchmarking of Irish motor insurance personal injury awards with those in other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  My Department is also focusing on the introduction of a number of additional supports for business. A Taking Care of Business event was held in Dublin Castle in November 2017 at which nearly 500 members of the business community &ndash; including SMEs, start-ups, entrepreneurs and business students &ndash;engaged face to face with 30 state agencies, offices and services to learn about the broad range of advice and support that are available for their business. A number of representative bodies from industry also came together to support the event. A further regional event is planned for 25th September in the Mid-West. A new Employment Permits Online System was launched in September 2016, achieving a 95% take-up rate in the first two weeks. This high rate of take-up has continued since then.  Under the new system, the application to decision time can take as little as 5-7 working days to complete, an excellent timeframe by international comparison. </p>  <p>  In April, my Department published its Statement of Strategy for the 2018-2021 period and this outlines the many areas where my Department will maintain focus over that timeframe to deliver on our commitments under the Programme for Partnership Government.</p></reply>

No.306 of 2011).<br /><br />  The full repeal of Regulation 6 of the European Communities (Mergers and Divisions of Companies) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 was not possible due to a difference in national law requirements on mergers concerning notice requirements and those provided for in the EU regulations on cross-border mergers.<br /><br />  The reason this section has not commenced is because it would repeal the foundation documents of the Bank of Ireland. The section will only be commenced once Bank of Ireland decides to convert to a company incorporated under the Companies Act 2014.</td></tr><tr><td>Sections 65 to 70 of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 </td><td>The Workplace Relations Commission was established on the 1st October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 and saw the merging of the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal into a new Body of First Instance - the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal were incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Sections 65 to 70 inclusive of the Workplace Relations Act, 2015 relate to the dissolution of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and cannot be commenced until the legacy caseload of the EAT has been finalised.

Currently, fees are refunded to the applicant only.  These provisions may commence when the necessary changes are made to the employment permits processing system to support such a policy change, subject to further consultations. The employment permit processing system has not yet been adapted to support the refund of fees to a person other than applicant.  If it is considered necessary to do so, consultation will need to take place with the relevant bodies as regards other legislation and any unintended impact of this provision, e.g. The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended, etc.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A full report on the review is due by end June, with recommendations on a framework for the future operation of the employment permits regime.  Following on from that Report, it is expected that a review of the lists of occupations for employment permits will be conducted in the second half of this year.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that retention issues in the State&rsquo;s labour market should not be addressed through the deployment of the employment permits system.  Healthcare Assistants are currently included on the ineligible list of employments.  In order to remove an occupation from this list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages and not to other factors such as salary and/or working conditions.  Organisations in the relevant sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed business case for removal of Healthcare Assistants from the ineligible list, based on this detailed data, would then need to be put forward by the Department of Health, as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department. </p><p>  I am aware that my colleague, Minister of State Daly, with special responsibility for Older People, has had various meetings with the nursing home sector and this matter has been discussed.

The Regulations, made under the 1972 European Communities Act, provide for civil redress measures and remedies in the event a trade secret is unlawfully acquired, used or disclosed.  The confidentiality of the trade secret during court proceedings is ensured by limiting access to the hearing and court documents containing the trade secret. </p>  <p>  During the course of my Department's public consultation on the transposition of the Directive, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform informed my Department it had obtained legal advice to the effect the Directive imposes a requirement of a subjective public interest test and that the transposing legislation should amend the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 by adding a requirement that "protected disclosure" which came within Article 5 (b) of the Directive must be made for the purpose of protecting the public interest.  Legal advice obtained by my Department supported this view and accordingly the S.I. contains such an amendment so that Ireland achieves a full transposition of the Directive.</p></reply>

Membership of leading International Research Organisations is an important mechanism for facilitating this engagement. For this reason, the Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 to initiate negotiations with CERN on Ireland's membership options. </p>  <p>  Discussions with CERN commenced in 2016 and senior officials from my department, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland visited CERN in Geneva in July 2016. The Director-General of CERN, Dr Fabiola Gianotti, visited Dublin in October 2016 and met with the former Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor T.D. The information gathered during these engagements has provided my officials with a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of membership of CERN. While these benefits are significant, the cost of membership is also significant. Therefore, the case for membership of CERN must be assessed in the context of other investment priorities.</p>  <p>  Regrettably, in view of the intense demands on the capital programme and the tight fiscal constraints it will not be possible to progress membership of CERN in 2018.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will be joining the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in October 2018, with a capital allocation obtained specifically to ensure Ireland's membership.  This will cost &euro;0.75 million in 2018 and increase to approximately &euro;3.5 million in 2019.  We will keep the issue of CERN membership under review and it is my hope that we may be in a position to progress CERN membership in the future, when the fiscal situation permits.</p></reply>

Provisional application is a standard part of EU trade agreements and allows only those parts of the agreement for which the EU has competence to be provisionally applied, pending the completion of each Member State&rsquo;s procedures according to the requirements of their national law.  </p>  <p>  Irish companies may now take advantage of important provisions in the Agreement including the immediate elimination of 98% of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the provisions relating to investment protection and the Investment Court System are excluded from provisional application.  This means Ireland or other Member States will not be bound by these provisions until they are ratified by all Member States in accordance with their national law.</p>  <p>  In this regard, given the request by Belgium for an Opinion (1/17) from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the compatibility of the Investment Court System in CETA with the European Treaties, I have no immediate plans to seek the ratification of the Agreement.  It would only be appropriate to do so after we have considered the Opinion of the CJEU.  I understand that the CJEU has proposed to fix a hearing in this case, the expected date will be 26th June 2018.  It is also important to see the benefits of CETA come into being, before it is put before the D&aacute;il for ratification so there is a fully informed debate based on facts and evidence.</p>  <p>  Ireland already has a strong trading relationship with Canada which is reflected in the &euro;3.4 billion worth of annual trade between both countries.  The value of Irish exports to Canada is worth &euro;2.5 billion whilst the value of Irish imports from Canada is worth &euro;868 million.  I welcome the provisional application of CETA which will provide increased opportunities for new and existing Irish companies trading with Canada to build and develop further these relationships, providing increased growth and jobs.  </p>  <p>  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  Promoting diversified export markets such as Canada in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for the Department, as reflected in our Ireland Connected Trade Strategy and Enterprise 2025 revised.</p></reply>

The indicative allocations for my Department are set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>2018</th><th>2019</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th><th>2022</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;555m</td><td>&euro;620m</td><td>&euro;630m</td><td>&euro;640m</td><td>&euro;715m</td></tr></table></p><p>The precise budgetary Ministerial capital ceilings for the years 2019 to 2022 and beyond will be determined as part of the relevant annual Estimates processes. It is not possible at this time to provide the Deputy with the capital funding allocations for the years requested.  </p><p>As regards the 2019 estimates process, it is expected that finalisation and publication of the 2019 REV allocations will be determined in early December 2019. Not withstanding the foregoing, the Deputy will be aware that the NDP, which is a ten-year plan out to 2027, also set out the investment priorities necessary to achieve the National Strategic Outcome 5: A Strong Economy, supported by Enterprise, Innovation and Skills. I and my Department are working to accelerate implementation of the key initiatives for which I have lead responsibility including: </p><p>-  In early April I launched the second phase of the &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund. This is part of a rolling programme of competitive calls over the coming years, and builds on the &euro;31m of awards I announced in December 2017;</p><p>-  I will announce the first call for proposals under the Disruptive  Technologies Innovation Fund in the coming weeks;</p><p>-  My Department is currently completing a review of the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018 and I will then bring forward proposals for a further scheme in 2019;</p><p>-  IDA Ireland is continuing to invest in property solutions to attract investments into the regions;</p><p>-  The number of world class Science Foundation Ireland Research Centres will increase further this year with the establishment of the Future Milk Centre; </p><p>-  Additional funding is being provided in 2018 and beyond to increase the number of PhD qualified researchers from higher education sector;</p><p>-  With the aid of funding from my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and support of the SBCI and EIB, I, along with Ministers Creed and Donohoe announced a new &euro;300 million Brexit working capital loan fund for businesses with less than 500 employees at the end of March. My Department is also working with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, SBCI and EIB on developing a long-term loan scheme for businesses affected by Brexit. </p><p>While the NDP is at a very early stage of its existence, I am determined to maximise the potential impacts of the funding being provided to my Department in the first five years of the Plan as set out above so as to ensure sustainable growth and quality employment for all. </p></reply>

This followed the expiry of temporary exemptions granted to the EU in respect of the original Presidential Proclamations imposing these tariffs from the 23rd March 2018.  The measures were introduced following an investigation by the US Department of Commerce into the effect of those industries on US national security.  Ireland is deeply disappointed by the US decision to end the temporary exemption tariffs on steel and aluminium which had been granted to EU.  </p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules.  Over the past number of months, the EU, Ireland and other Member States have engaged with the US at all possible levels and with other partners to find a solution to the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector.  These were issues I raised with Commerce Secretary Ross during my recent visit to Washington in May.  I regret that these efforts, by the EU Trade Commissioner, Ireland and other Member States have not resulted in the EU being provided with a permanent exemption from US tariffs.  The EU has continually indicated its openness to discuss ways to improve bilateral trade relations but has been clear that any talks must be preceded by a permanent exemption.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU Commission in its determination to fully protect the EU&rsquo;s commercial interests from US steel and aluminium tariffs, in a WTO compatible manner.  This includes the launching of proceedings against the US at the WTO, the imposition of rebalancing tariff measures (i.e. withdrawing tariff concessions on a number of imports from the US) and the possible imposition of safeguard measures (import quotas or tariffs to shield EU producers from a sudden influx of steel or aluminium into the EU market that would have ordinarily been destined for the US market).  </p>  <p>  With regard to the company referenced, its main activity is the production of alumina which is then exported for further processing to aluminium. I understand that the company does not directly export to the US and that the tariffs in question may therefore have limited immediate direct impact. However, it may be the case that customers of the firm could be affected. The IDA is therefore closely engaging with the company to determine the potential scope of any impact and we will continue to closely monitor the situation as it evolves.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-12a.1510.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061200084#WRBB05500"><p>The Deputy will be familiar with Government Policy aimed at combatting the misuse of alcohol, a key feature of which is the Public Health Alcohol Bill which contains a number of provisions including one on the health labelling of alcohol products and another on the regulation of advertising and marketing of alcohol. </p>  <p>  At present under EU food labelling rules the amount of information that must be presented to the consumer on the labels of alcoholic drinks is less than that of other food products.  EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers (FIC) provides an exemption for alcoholic beverages containing more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol from the obligation to list ingredients or provide a nutrition declaration, such as the energy value and the amounts of fat, saturates, carbohydrate, sugars, protein and salt contained in the product</p>  <p>  The Regulation places an obligation on the European Commission to adopt a report addressing whether or not alcoholic beverages should be covered by the requirement to provide the list of ingredients and the nutrition declaration, and the reasons justifying possible exemptions.  This report was adopted by the EU Commission on 13 March 2017. In its conclusion it stated that as a first step current voluntary initiatives by industry should be allowed to develop further so as to provide a list of ingredients and nutrition declaration. The Commission invited industry to present a self-regulatory proposal that would cover the entire sector of alcoholic beverages. </p>  <p>  The Commission would then assess the industry's proposal and if it was considered that the self-regulatory approach proposed by industry was unsatisfactory, the Commission would then launch an impact assessment to review further available options, in line with Better Regulation principles.</p>  <p>  On the 12 March 2018, the alcoholic beverage industry submitted a self-regulatory proposal to the Commission which consisted of a joint self-regulatory proposal from the European alcoholic beverages sectors on the provision of nutrition and ingredients listing.  The proposal includes guiding principles and separate labelling proposals for each beverage sector, i.e. spirits drinks, wine, beer, cider and fruit wines.</p>  <p>  The proposal does not contain a harmonised approach across all alcoholic beverage sectors and suggests that in certain cases some information could be provided &ldquo;off label&rdquo;, i.e. on websites or other electronic platforms. The matter is currently being considered by the Commission to determine if EU regulation will be proposed rather than the voluntary labelling programme.    </p>  <p>  At a more global level, under the auspices of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, there are indications of some preliminary work being considered on alcohol beverage labelling.  The most recent meeting of the Codex Committee on Food Labelling (CCFL) took place in October 2017.</p>  <p>  Following a discussion paper presented by the World Health Organisation, the Committee identified a number of areas for potential future work and included in the list was alcoholic beverages labelling.  A concern expressed was that similar overlapping work is underway in other international organisations.  The Committee, therefore, agreed that information would be sought from member countries, via a Circular Letter (still to issue), on current practices, issues in alcoholic beverages labelling and allergen labelling; and identify in Codex where provisions already exist and any potential further role for CCFL.</p>  <p>  The CCFL agreed to develop a discussion paper on alcoholic beverages labelling.  This will be prepared by the Russian Federation with assistance from EU, Ghana, India and Senegal and future work will be subject to approval from the Codex Alimentarius Commission, at which Ireland will be represented.</p>  <p>  My Department welcomes efforts at EU and other international levels to improve the requirements for the labelling of alcoholic beverages.  While such efforts may be in keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s national policy on the consumption of alcoholic drinks, it will be some time before agreement on international proposals is reached.  In the interim, my Department will pursue the proposals already outlined in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, as I believe this is in the best interest of public health.</p>  <p>  In terms of labelling of alcohol beverages, the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill reflects the work of Codex in this area.  The labelling provisions in the Bill will ensure that consumers can make informed choices about their drinking.  </p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the following information on the label of an alcohol product: </p>  <p>  -  A warning to inform the public of the danger of alcohol consumption; </p>  <p>  -  A warning to inform the public of the danger of alcohol consumption when pregnant;</p>  <p>  -  A warning to inform the public of the direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers;</p>  <p>  -  The quantity of grams of alcohol contained in the product;</p>  <p>  -  The number of calories contained in the alcohol product; and</p>  <p>  -  Details of a HSE website providing information on alcohol and related harms.</p>  <p>  Products sold in kegs or casks will have an accompanying document with the above information.  Licensed premises will have a notice with the warnings and website information as above and will confirm that a document noting the alcohol content and energy value of every product for sale in the premises is available on request.  The information will also be required to be on any website that sells alcohol online.  The aim is to provide consumers with information about alcohol products regardless of the manner of purchase, whether in a shop, public house, on-line, etc.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible. This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible. In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass.</p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow. Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources. This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services. </p>  <p>  The HSE is liaising with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities. The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services. The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department of Health was represented on the Strategy Committee that developed the NSWG, and is also represented on the Committee overseeing its implementation. which has met on three occasions since the NSWG launch, on 13th July and 26th September, 2017 and 25th January, 2018. A further meeting is scheduled for 13th June, 2018.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is principally involved with implementation of Objective Two of the NSWG; "Advance the Physical and Mental Health and Wellbeing of Women and Girls". </p>  <p>  Action 2.1 of the NSWG commits to "Strengthen partnership work with the National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) in identifying and implementing  key actions to address the particular physical and mental health needs of women and girls in order to advance the integration of their needs into existing and emerging health strategies, policies and programmes through an action plan for women's health".</p>  <p>  Under this Action, the Department and the HSE are working with the NWCI, and, potentially, additional relevant organisations, including others in receipt of funding from the HSE, such that an advanced partnership approach can be developed to support the implementation of existing actions and needs outlined in the NSWG. </p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland Framework provides the over-arching context for  progressing actions with regard to the health and wellbeing of women and girls. Healthy Ireland takes a whole of Government and whole of society approach to improving health and wellbeing, with a focus on prevention, reducing health inequalities and keeping people healthier for longer. </p>  <p>  Within the context of Healthy Ireland, there are currently a number of issues  where  improvements in the health and wellbeing of women and girls could have significant impacts; these are set out in the NSWG. </p>  <p>  These  include improving awareness and supporting healthier choices in terms of smoking cessation, safer alcohol consumption, improving uptake of the  HPV vaccine, increasing physical activity participation rates in younger women and improving rates of folic acid consumption and breast-feeding.</p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland approach is that many organisations have a role to play in achieving the goals of Healthy Ireland and in implementing the  various strategies and plans under the Healthy Ireland aegis. Hence, the Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work in partnership  with the NWCI and other relevant organisations, to support women and  girls in improving their health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  The NWCI have been funded for work in the area of gender and health since 2011. This work has evolved to scope the development of the Women's Health Action Plan in partnership with the HSE in 2018. A number of engagement meetings have taken place in 2018 between representatives of the NWCI and the HSE in order to advance this work. </p>  <p>  While the work is at an early stage of scoping, it is clear that there are a number of key programmes across the HSE which currently target and engage successfully on women's health; these include the Early Childhood Programme and the Tobacco Programme, the Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme, the Perinatal and Mental Health Programme and the Maternity and Infant Health Programme as well as significant work under the Primary Care and Social Inclusion areas. </p>  <p>  The scoping work will include gathering existing data on women's health and commitments in existing policies that support women's health and wellbeing. This work is underway but is at an early stage. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to support the HSE and NWCI in furthering their aims regarding women's health and in developing the Women's Health Action Plan.</p></reply>

The HPV test is more accurate testing mechanism than liquid-based cytology, which is the current testing mechanism, and its use would result in fewer false negative results. Its introduction is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally. </p>  <p>  Switching to HPV testing as the primary screening mechanism will require a reconfiguration of laboratory services. While the extent to which the HPV testing can be done in Ireland is being assessed, it is likely that a tendering process will be needed to meet at least some of the HPV testing requirement.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.</p>  <p>  I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

I intend to harness the consensus generated by the Report to move forward with a programme of health reform. This Government is committed to making tangible improvements in our health service and the Sl&aacute;intecare Report provides the direction of travel for this. </p>  <p>  The development of a Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan is now well advanced and I expect to bring proposals to Government for consideration in the coming weeks. This plan will set out a detailed programme of reform to be undertaken in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  I have already taken action on several of the specific recommendations proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. A Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office is being established in the Department of Health. This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. The appointment of an Executive Director for the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office will be made shortly. </p>  <p>  An independent board for the HSE is being established as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. The General Scheme of a Bill has been published and it is hoped that legislation will be enacted this year.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Report recommended the removal of private practice from public hospital. I have established an Independent Review Group to examine how private practice can be removed from public hospitals. It will report later this year.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the geographical alignment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations has recently been completed and will inform work on broader health service structural reform as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has demonstrated significant commitment to invest in our health and social care services since the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report. Funding for new initiatives in Budget 2018 were closely aligned with proposals in Sl&aacute;intecare. These new initiatives included investing &euro;25 million a new Primary Care fund, additional funding of &euro;25 million allocated for home care and transition beds, &euro;17 million to reduce medicine and prescription charges, &euro;75 million targeted to reduce waiting list and &euro;1 million for the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review, which was called for in the Report, was published in January, and the recently published National Development Plan contains a commitment to fund significant new capacity &ndash; 2,600 acute hospital beds and 4,500 community care beds over the next decade. It also contains funding to deliver on the eHealth strategy in full which is a key recommendation in Sl&aacute;intecare. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Budget 2019 will be subject to discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the normal manner and I am not able to comment on specifics at this stage.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. </p>  <p>  At present, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.

The Department has had a number of engagements with the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) in this regard.

Through the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (or NTPF) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), the overall number of patients waiting for cataract surgery has fallen by 22% since July 2017, while the number of patients waiting more than 12 months has declined by 71% in the same period. For 2018, under the Inpatient/Day Case Action Plan, all clinically suitable patients waiting for more than 9 months for a Cataract procedure will be offered treatment this year, with 5,000 NTPF funded procedures planned in both public and private hospitals. </p>  <p>  Last year funding was allocated to provide additional capacity at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and as a result, a cataract theatre is now operational three days per week.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  In relation to variations in the cost of care for public and private nursing homes it is acknowledged that public nursing homes have, in general, a higher cost of care. It is understood that a number of factors contribute to this such as higher dependency levels of residents requiring a higher staff skill mix, environmental implications for staffing levels and the geographical provision of residential placements.</p>  <p>  That said, there is a need to undertake a deeper analysis of the factors driving the higher costs of care in public units. The 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme identified the need for a Value for Money and Policy (VFM) review of the cost differentials in public and private/voluntary residential facilities. The Department will be working on this review throughout the year.</p>  <p>  I have also asked the Interdepartmental Working Group established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations contained in the NHSS Review 2015 to examine the issue of additional charges, as part of its on-going work. </p>  <p>  In the first instance a Department of Health/HSE project group was established to examine the high level issues regarding additional charges in nursing homes participating in the NHSS. The project work is underway and the team has written to a number of private/voluntary and public nursing homes with a view to arranging individual meetings to examine the matter. On foot of this initial engagement, visits to nursing homes are being scheduled and will be conducted over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The implementation of any recommendations arising from this work will be developed with the input and support of relevant stakeholders from the sector.</p></reply>

These measures were subsequently endorsed by the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures - Human (CMDh), a medicines regulatory body representing all EU and EEA member states. Because the CMDh position was agreed by majority vote, it was sent to the European Commission, which issued a final legally binding decision valid across the EU on 31 May.</p><p>The new measures include a ban on the use of valproate-containing medicines for migraine or bipolar disorder during pregnancy, and a ban on using such medicines to treat epilepsy during pregnancy unless there is no other effective treatment available.</p><p>In addition, these medicines must not be used in any woman or girl able to have children unless the conditions of a new pregnancy prevention programme are met. The programme is designed to ensure that patients taking valproate are fully aware of the risks and the need to avoid becoming pregnant while taking the drug. </p><p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is working with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new risk minimisation measures in Ireland, including materials developed to support safe prescribing and dispensing of valproate, and in particular to ensure that patients and carers are fully informed of the risks and can discuss options with their doctor.</p><p>Measures currently being updated in line with the new recommendations include:</p><p>- Changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals;</p><p>- A visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines;</p><p>- Revised educational materials for patients and doctors; and</p><p>- A patient alert card to be attached to the product packaging </p><p>The HSE is working in partnership with relevant patient representatives and clinical experts to review the diagnostic and support services required by people who may have been affected by foetal anticonvulsant syndrome (FACS).</p><p>For women currently taking sodium valproate, which is marketed under the brand name Epilim in Ireland, the clear advice from the HPRA and the HSE is that they should not stop taking this medicine suddenly; instead they should get in touch with their doctor or pharmacist for further guidance.</p></reply>

Independent inspections carried out by HIQA commenced on 1 July 2009. This system replaced the previous one, under which the HSE registered and inspected private nursing homes only.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising regulations and National Quality Standards.  </p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, replaced the 2009 Care &amp;amp; Welfare Regulations. These regulations contain provisions for the purposes of ensuring proper standards of care for nursing homes and include health care planning, residents&rsquo; rights and protection from abuse. Operators must arrange comprehensive assessments of the health, personal and social care needs of residents and prepare and individualised care plan based on this assessment. The regulations also provide for training and staff development and include requirements for the management and control of operations of nursing homes. </p>  <p>  Revised National Quality Standards were approved by the Minister for Health in 2016, placing a stronger focus on quality of life and a person-centred approach to the care of all residents. </p>  <p>  The recently published overview of HIQA regulation of social care and healthcare services 2017 recognises that there remain some issues to be addressed, and the Authority will continue to focus on these key areas through its inspection programme. It acknowledged however that many nursing home providers go beyond basic compliance with the regulations and are striving to achieve quality improvement as set out in the National Standards.  </p>  <p>  Separate to the regulatory regime introduced in 2009 the Deputy will be aware that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was also introduced that year to address the then inequity in the treatment of public and private long-term nursing home residents and to alleviate the financial hardship being experienced by long-term residents in private nursing homes. The scheme supports individuals in need of long-term nursing home care regardless of whether they choose public, private or voluntary nursing homes.</p></reply>

Under the Misuse of Drugs legislation products containing THC are strictly controlled and possession is unlawful except under licence.</p><p>- CBD is derived from cannabis. However, since it is not psychoactive it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation, and does not require a Ministerial Licence.</p><p><b>Access to Medical Cannabis via the Ministerial Licence Route</b></p><p>- Currently medical practitioners who wish to prescribe cannabis products containing THC may apply to the Minister for Health, for a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  </p><p>- The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.</p><p><b>How to apply for a Ministerial licence</b></p><p>- A medical cannabis licence application submitted to the Minister for Health, in line with the Misuse of Drugs Acts, must include: </p><p>- An outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe cannabis.</p><p>- Details of the cannabis product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient.</p><p>- The source of the cannabis product.</p><p>- The arrangements for the ongoing monitoring and care of the patient once the cannabis-based treatment has commenced.</p><p>The application must be submitted either by the patient&rsquo;s medical consultant, or by their General Practitioner (GP).<b></b>Applications from the patient's GP must include written endorsement for the proposed cannabis treatment for the individual patients by the patient's consultant.</p><p>The decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment, including cannabis treatment, for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. The Minister for Health has no role in this clinical decision-making process.</p><p>Consultants or GPs requiring further information or clarification in relation to the licence application process are advised to contact the Department of Health directly. Valid applications received are assessed without delay.</p><p><b>Medicinal Cannabis Access Programme (under development)</b></p><p>The Minister for Health is in the process of establishing a &lsquo;Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme&rsquo; to facilitate access to cannabis-based products, that are not authorised as medicines but are of a standardised quality and meet an acceptable level of quality assurance. The access programme will be established to provide access to cannabis treatments for patients who are under the care of a medical consultant, for the following medical conditions which have failed to respond to standard treatments: </p><p>- spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions; </p><p>- intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;</p><p>- severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications. </p><p>An Expert Group appointed by the Minister has drawn up clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme and Department of Health Officials are working on legislation to underpin the Access Programme. The access programme is not yet in operation. </p><p>In the meantime access to cannabis for medical treatment is via the aforementioned Ministerial licence application route, which will continue to operate in parallel to the Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme, once the programme becomes operational.</p></reply>

The purpose of the facility is to provide a clean, safe, healthcare environment where people who inject drugs can access medical and social services from healthcare professionals. The ultimate aim is to reduce the number of heroin-related deaths, of which there were 82 in 2015.</p>  <p>  The legislative basis for the establishment of such a facility is set out in the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Act 2017  (No.7 of 2017), which came into operation on 30 November 2017.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health allocated &euro;1.5m to the HSE for the establishment of the pilot facility for 2018.</p>  <p>  In February 2018, the HSE announced Merchants Quay Project CLG as the preferred bidder to operate a supervised injecting facility in Dublin city centre on a pilot basis. The awarding of the contract followed a HSE procurement process initiated in August 2017 and is subject to normal planning permission approval.</p>  <p>  I understand that no resources for the facility have been allocated to Merchants Quay Project pending the awarding of planning permission from Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  I support the establishment of a supervised injecting facility as a public health initiative to save lives and to ensure safer communities. Evidence from countries with such facilities shows that they are cost-effective in the long-run, through reducing ill-health for injecting drug users and by improving the environment for residents and businesses. Engaging with local stakeholders, including schools, is therefore an important element of the set up and running of the facility.</p></reply>

The overall aim of the Review is to reorganise primary care eye services with an increased emphasis on maximising delivery of a comprehensive service at primary care level, thereby also releasing capacity in the acute sector to provide more complex services.  This reflects Government policy, which aims to maximise the proportion of people's healthcare needs met in the community.  </p>  <p>  To support the implementation of the Report, funding of &euro;1m was allocated in 2018 to establish primary care eye teams in South and West Dublin and to further develop the primary care eye team in North Dublin to help alleviate waiting lists.  Further steps towards implementation of the recommendations in the Report will be considered in the context of the Health budget for 2019 and future years.</p></reply>

Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private, have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising Regulations and National Standards.  </p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007 (Care &amp;amp; Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations, 2013 contain provisions relating to 'Medicines and pharmaceutical services' and 'Managing behaviour that is challenging' including a requirement that where restraint is used, it is used only in accordance with national policy. All nursing homes are required to have written policies on the ordering, receipt, prescribing, storing and administration of medicines and on restraint. Providers must keep detailed records of all occasions on which restraint is used. These records must be available for examination by HIQA. The regulations require providers to notify the Chief Inspector on a quarterly basis of any occasion when restraint was used.   Revised National Quality Standards for Residential care settings for Older People (2016) place a stronger focus on quality of life and a person-centred approach to the care of all residents.   Standard 3.4 provides that &ldquo;Each resident is protected through the residential service&rsquo;s policies and procedures for medicines management&rdquo; and Standard 3.5 requires providers to have in place &ldquo;Arrangements to protect residents from harm, promote bodily integrity, personal liberty and a restraint-free environment in accordance with national policy&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  National policy on restraint, including chemical, physical and environmental restraint is set out in Towards a Restraint Free Environment in Nursing Homes, (2011) and is available on the Department of Health website.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy (2014) acknowledges that in some cases the use of psychotropic medications is appropriate in conjunction with environmental interventions for the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). However, anti-psychotic drugs should only be used when all other non-pharmacological interventions have first been tried and exhausted. The National Dementia Strategy recommends that the HSE develop guidance material on the appropriate management of medication for people with dementia, and in particular on psychotropic medication management, with material to be made available in all relevant settings, including nursing homes. To address this action, the HSE&rsquo;s National Dementia Office has convened a national interdisciplinary steering group to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines for healthcare professionals on the use of psychotropic medications in people with dementia, with a particular focus on antipsychotics. The guidelines will be submitted to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee to be implemented as national clinical guidelines. The steering group will also develop an associated psychotropic medication audit tool and education and training materials in parallel with the clinical guidelines.</p></reply>

The process for this is described in the &lsquo;Guide to the Notification System for Exempt Medicinal Products&rsquo; which is available on the website of the HPRA.

The implementation of an age extension of BreastCheck to 65-69 year olds commenced in Quarter 4 of 2015. The age extension is being implemented on an incremental basis, and it is anticipated that the full age extension will be implemented by 2021.</p>  <p>  BreastCheck is an important aspect of cancer control in Ireland and it is not envisaged that there will be any cut to the current funding levels of the programme.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p><p>I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

The  Government has approved the General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to its  decision and I understand that the  drafting process is currently underway and that the Bill is on the list of  priority legislation for publication in the current session.  Indeed, I  understand that the drafting of the legislation is significantly advanced with  an expected publication date, subject to Government approval, of the end of  June.</p>  <p>  In advance of the legislation coming into effect, the Government agreed that interim arrangements would be introduced for serving public servants who reach the age of 65 years between the date of the Government Decision and the coming into effect of the necessary legislation. These arrangements enable such public servants to be retained until they reach the age of eligibility for the Contributory State Pension, 66 years.</p>  <p>  These are strictly interim arrangements to be applied to public servants up to the date of their eligibility for the Contributory State Pension only. This reflects the Government Decision and therefore there are no provisions for any exceptions to the criteria for retention as set out in the Department of Health Circular 15/2017.</p></reply>

This means that the price of individual products will depend on their strength. </p><p>A ban on below cost selling based on the invoice cost price of the alcohol product to the retailer does not target strong, cheap alcohol. It does not address the health harms associated with the harmful consumption of strong cheap alcohol products. This is because products that are cheap relative to their alcohol content will continue to be sold at a level that represents a serious threat to public health.</p><p>Research carried out by the University of Sheffield indicates that a ban on below-cost selling would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms as many of the cheapest alcohol products are already priced in or around excise duty plus VAT. </p><p>In addition to Minimum unit pricing the Bill provides for the making of regulations prohibiting or restricting price-based promotions which, either alone, or in tandem with minimum unit pricing would be effective in reducing alcohol consumption, related harms and associated costs.</p><p>The Government Decision approving Minimum unit pricing acknowledged the need for this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland to act simultaneously in order to allay concerns about impacts on cross-border trade. I recognise that it will be most effective if an equivalent measure is introduced in Northern Ireland at the same time. However, Minimum Unit Pricing is an important measure and on that basis I will reflect further, after the enactment of the Bill, before deciding on the timing of the commencement of this provision.</p></reply>

This formulation led to some uncertainty so on that basis, I provided for a specific height for the required barrier of a minimum of 1.2 metres. In proposing that minimum height, I recognised the concern that a higher barrier might expose retailers to non-compliance with certain requirements, such as those related to planning or fire safety legislation. </p>  <p>  The presence of a physical barrier will ensure there is a marked separation of alcohol products from other ordinary products in a mixed-retail outlet and the minimum height is such to ensure reduced visibility of alcohol products for young children. </p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p></reply>

Arising out of the review, a recommendation was made to examine the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme. The Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.</p>  <p>  At present, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses, except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Any changes to the scheme, if approved by Government, will require amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.</p>  <p>  A Memorandum for Government setting out the details of the proposed policy change and seeking Government approval to draft the General Scheme of a bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 has been circulated to other Government Departments for observations.</p></reply>

The Report represents a significant milestone in the history of health services development in Ireland, and I intend to harness the consensus generated by the Report to move forward with a programme of health reform.  The Government is committed to making tangible improvements in our health service and the Sl&aacute;intecare Report provides the direction of travel for this.</p>  <p>  To that end, work is at an advanced stage in my Department in developing a Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan.  This Plan will translate the Sl&aacute;intecare Report into a detailed programme of reform over the next 10 years, with a focus on the immediate years ahead.  I expect to bring these proposals to Government in the next few weeks and to publish the Implementation Plan shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

A Reference Group comprising people with lived experience of disability and disability services was also established, and the views of this group informed the Task Force deliberations.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.  In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass.</p>  <p>  However, when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow.  Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources.  This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services.</p>  <p>  The HSE intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities.  The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.  The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The OPAP recommended that a code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship be developed, implemented and evaluated in conjunction with the food industry, HSE, Dept of Children and Youth Affairs, safefood, Food Safety Authority of Ireland and advertiser organisations.  The OPAP premised this recommendation by providing that 'already there are many examples of the food industry making positive contributions to the prevention of obesity and it is essential to capitalise and expand on such initiatives'.</p>  <p>  On this basis, the group that developed and agreed the Codes involved representatives from the food industry (IBEC, Food Drink Ireland, Retail Ireland), advertising sector (Association of Advertisers in Ireland, Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland), statutory agencies, and various Government Departments.  It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</p>  <p>  I launched the Codes in February.  Their overall objective is to reduce exposure of the Irish population to marketing initiatives relating to foods that are high in fat, sugar and/or salt.</p>  <p>  The Codes of Practice are one of the suite of actions set out in the OPAP in the knowledge that no single sector or agency, or no single action, is able to solve this issue on its own.  Everyone and every sector have a role to play in those solutions.  They apply to non-broadcast media given that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is the regulator of broadcasting in Ireland with its own Children's Commercial Communications Code.</p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Codes of Practice provides for a governance framework for these codes.  It stipulates that the Codes will be monitored for compliance and effectiveness by a Monitoring Body designated by the Minister for Health.  Work on this designation is underway.</p>  <p>  The Monitoring Body will maintain and publish a register of signatories of companies and partner organisations that will sign up to the Codes.  Section 10 adds that complaint procedures will be an integral part of the agreed Codes of Practice and that it will have the responsibility to investigate any complaint submitted and seek remedial action if necessary.  The Monitoring Body shall produce an annual report for the Minister which shall cover effectiveness and complaints.  All complaints upheld will be published.</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health agree a set level of funding for the NHSS with the HSE each year having regard for the demand for the Scheme and the overall fiscal position. The 2018 budget for NHSS is &euro;962m. In order to manage the demand for the Scheme over a 12 month period, the HSE has a target of maintaining the wait time for funding approval at no more than 4 weeks. This target has consistently been achieved since April 2015 and it is a significant reduction from the October 2014 wait time of 15 weeks. The target of 4 weeks for approval of funding remains a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  State support can only be paid once a financial assessment has been completed and authorised.</p>  <p>  The National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the NHSS provide that State Support and the Nursing Home Loan should be paid in respect of qualified applicants from either the date that the application is approved, or date of admission to the nursing home whichever is the later. Therefore in the case where an applicant is already residing in a nursing home when they apply for State support through NHSS this support will be paid from the date that the application is approved and cannot be backdated to the admission date.</p>  <p>  This provision enables the HSE to manage the budget and commitments under the Scheme over a 12 month period, ensuring that long-term residential care remains accessible and affordable for those that require it.</p></reply>

The actions include the implementation of policies at hospital and community level; investment in breast-feeding training and skills development for healthcare staff; the provision of additional lactation specialist posts; and partnership working to promote a culture that accepts and supports breast-feeding maternal education and social class.</p>  <p>  One specific action is to strengthen compliance with the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes and subsequent World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions. This will include developing measures to improve and monitor compliance.  The International Code &amp;amp; WHA resolutions will become policy for all Government departments, the HSE &amp;amp; contracted agencies and services. The HSE is drafting a policy to support the International Code of Marketing and this will be implemented by the HSE through partnership &amp;amp; cross- sectorial working and will be ongoing.</p></reply>

Arising out of the review, a recommendation was made to examine the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme.  The Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.</p>  <p>  At present, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.  This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses, except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Any changes to the scheme, if approved by Government, will require amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  </p>  <p>  A Memorandum for Government setting out the details of the proposed policy change and seeking Government approval to draft the General Scheme of a bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 has been circulated to other Government Departments for observations.</p></reply>

This included economic modelling to project the financial cost of each of the strategies.</p>  <p>  Currently cervical screening samples undergo cytology screening as the primary screening test and following the move to HPV testing, cervical screening samples will undergo a HPV test as the primary screening test and women whose samples show HPV infection will be triaged using cytology to determine if there are any abnormal cell changes. </p>  <p>  The HTA did not recommend co-testing as both tests (liquid-based cytology and HPV) have been shown to be effective as a primary screening test.</p>  <p>  I approved the switch to HPV testing as the primary screening mechanism for the CervicalCheck programme in February.  The introduction of the test was intended for October of this year and I have asked the HSE to implement the move to HPV testing as the primary screening method as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  While the extent to which the HPV testing can be done in Ireland is being assessed, it is likely that a tendering process will be needed to meet at least some of the HPV testing requirement.</p></reply>

HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections is aimed at ensuring that standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified.  Over the last number of years HIQA inspectors conducted thematic inspections of nursing homes focused on dementia care and this will continue.</p>  <p>  The National Standards for Residential Care for Older People provide a framework for HIQA to assess the quality of service provided in nursing homes.  They place a strong focus on quality of life and a person-centred approach to care for all residents including those with dementia.  </p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for the in most appropriate settings. Anyone who is assessed as requiring long-term nursing home care can avail of the scheme, regardless of age. The nursing home care provided under the scheme must be appropriate to meet the individual&rsquo;s care needs.  </p>  <p>  A fundamental principle enshrined in the legislation underpinning the Scheme is that of patient choice. Once a person receives approval for financial support, they can choose to enter any nursing home that is participating in the scheme in any part of the country, subject to the nursing home having an available bed and being able to cater for the person's particular needs, including their cognitive function. This applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes alike.</p>  <p>  In relation to costs, the price agreed between the National Treatment Purchase Fund and each nursing home participating in the NHSS is averaged to take account of the range of dependency levels of all residents.</p>  <p>  There are a number of dementia specific residential care units across the country and most nursing homes will accommodate people living with dementia, however they may not have a secured dementia unit or dedicated dementia beds. While some people will enter long-term care with a formal diagnosis of dementia, others will develop dementia while they are resident in the nursing home. </p>  <p>  A survey of nursing homes in Ireland, undertaken by the Dementia Services Information and Development Centre in 2014, reported that there were 54 Dementia Specific Units accommodating 1,034 people with dementia. Figures on the number of people with dementia in long-stay care range from between 40% and 50% (O&rsquo;Shea et al, 2017) however this information is not collected on a regular basis. Information on the number of people with dementia requiring long-term care is also not centrally collated by the HSE.  </p></reply>

The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  For each registered nursing home a single price is agreed for all residents participating in the scheme regardless of the level of dependency and need for care. The NTPF assert that existing prices are averaged to take account of the levels of dependency that currently prevail among nursing home residents, and this already includes a significant proportion of people with dementia.</p></reply>

The OPAP recommended that a code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship be developed, implemented and evaluated in conjunction with the food industry, HSE, Dept of Children and Youth Affairs, safefood, Food Safety Authority of Ireland and advertiser organisations. The OPAP premised this recommendation by providing that 'already there are many examples of the food industry making positive contributions to the prevention of obesity and it is essential to capitalise and expand on such initiatives'.</p>  <p>  The group that developed the Codes involved representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments. It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The Codes of Practice concerned were published in February.</p>  <p>  The Codes of Practice are one of the suite of actions set out in the OPAP in the knowledge that no single sector or agency, or no single action, is able to solve this issue on their own. Everyone and every sector has a role to play in those solutions.</p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Codes of Practice provides for a governance framework for these codes. It stipulates that the Codes 'will be monitored for compliance and effectiveness by a monitoring body designated by the Minister for Health'  and that the Codes 'will be underpinned by guidance developed by the monitoring body with respect to its application'  It is not possible at this juncture to specify a timeframe for the development of the latter; but work on the establishment of the monitoring body is underway, and I expect that significant progress will be made in this regard in the coming months.</p></reply>

A draft submission has been received from the HSE in this regard and is currently under consideration by my Department.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Capacity Review, the demographic pressures being experienced by the health service are such as to demand not just additional capacity but continued emphasis on health and well-being initiatives, an improved model of care with a stronger role for enhanced community based services and continued improvement in productivity including in acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health at &euro;10.9 billion over the next 10 years.  This will provide for a major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand.  Importantly, the accelerated introduction of additional capacity for 2018/2019 will be matched by forthcoming reforms including the publication of a detailed Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

The HSE, for example, has implemented a Governance Framework which underpins the funding relationship between the HSE and these agencies.</p>  <p>  While the HSE will continue to develop this Framework it has also been acknowledged that there is a need to establish Contract Management Support Units (CMSUs) in the Community Health Organisations (CHOs) to address matters such as conducting the recommended frequency of monitoring meetings in all cases and that the oversight of multi-agreement agencies is co-ordinated.</p>  <p>  Because of the resource implications involved in the establishment of CMSUs, they will be established on a phased basis &ndash; commencing in 2018.  The HSE has already established a CMSU Implementation Group and Phase 1 (2018) will include the appointment of a Head of CMSU in each CHO area and additional staff being appointed to a number of priority CHOs.</p>  <p>  When fully established, the CMSUs will assist service managers in managing and documenting all aspects of the relationship with agencies.  The HSE will then be in a position to further enhance and oversee the delivery of services by agencies in a manner that will give ongoing assurance in relation to the significant amounts of Exchequer funding involved.</p></reply>

The HSE policy in respect of Consultant Appointments, both permanent and temporary, requires that they are on the relevant Specialist Register.

In July 2017 the HSE issued clear instructions to all hospitals to ensure:-</p><p>(i)  all consultants not on the Specialist Register are identified, using the National Doctors Training and Planning DIME database, </p><p>(ii) that a risk mitigation plan is put in place for each post where the appointee does not hold the relevant qualifications, </p><p>(iii) where necessary, this plan should set up access to an appropriate arrangement for senior clinical oversight as required, and </p><p>(iv) the Hospital Groups provide an assurance to the appropriate National Service Director that the required relevant supervisory supports are in place for those Consultants not on the Specialist Register.</p><p>Hospitals have been required by the HSE to identify those Consultants engaged prior to March 2008 who do not hold Specialist Division registration and to liaise with National Doctors Training and Planning to support them in achieving registration.  The HSE will bear the cost of applications to the Medical Council in these cases.</p></reply>

This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses.  The general scheme, although having lower income thresholds, provides for income disregards and relevant outgoings to be taken into account in the assessment process. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be deemed eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis, if they are judged to face undue hardship in arranging GP services as a result of medical or social circumstances.  In addition, from August 2015, all persons aged 70 or older qualify for a GP Visit Card, regardless of income.</p>  <p>  There are no proposals at present to amend the current income limits for the granting of eligibility for medical cards for persons aged 70 and over.  However, it should be noted that the gross income limits are reviewed annually and considered in the context of the budget.</p></reply>

To this end, the Programme has developed a detailed Implementation Plan which I was pleased to launch in October 2017.  The Plan is presented under the Strategy's four strategic priorities and details how each of the 77 actions will be implemented.</p>  <p>  The Programme has estimated that full implementation will cost in the region of an additional &euro;80 million revenue funding over the lifetime of the Strategy.  Work to identify the precise capital funding requirement is ongoing.  The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years and therefore the funding requirement will vary from year to year.  In that context, the Implementation Plan will inform the annual Estimates process each year.  I can confirm that additional funding of &euro;4.15 million is being provided to the Programme this year for the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to ultrasound services and additional funding has been made available for that purpose.  Indeed, one of the Programme's priorities for 2018 is to increase access to anomaly scans.  I understand that the Programme has approved the appointment of an additional 28 ultrasonographers which was the total requirement identified to provide 100% access to anomaly scanning.  The Programme is also working with the maternity networks to ensure foetal medicine expertise is available when an anomaly is identified.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly on your specific queries concerning maternity-related ultrasonography services and to provide a detailed breakdown of the 2018 &euro;4.15 million allocation for the Strategy.</p></reply>

This is to support the Agency's risk management objective to implement targeted personal injury and property damage risk work programmes to mitigate litigation risk in State authorities and healthcare enterprises, in order to reduce the costs of future litigation against the State. </p>  <p>  The Agency does not release data pertaining to an individual location as it has the potential of identifying sensitive information relating to an individual.  Also, such information can be taken out of context and may lead to an adverse impact on incident reporting rates within these locations.  The Agency proactively supports the increase in incident reporting by a healthcare service as it is considered to be indicative of the development of a strong patient safety culture.</p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.    </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  </p><p>The 2013 Act does not give the Minister for Health any powers in this regard.  The HSE does not require approval or consent from the Minister or Government when making a reimbursement decision.</p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  </p><p>The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention. </p><p>The HSE works with the objective of within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), either:</p><p>adding the medicine to the reimbursement list or agreeing to reimburse it as a hospital medicine,</p><p>refusing to reimburse the medicine.  </p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible and within the 180 days.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process, especially when the price sought by a manufacturer poses a very significant affordability challenge.</p><p>I am keen to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p></reply>

Arising out of the review, a recommendation was made to examine the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme. The Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.</p>  <p>  At present, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Any changes to the scheme, if approved by Government, will require amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.</p>  <p>  A Memorandum for Government setting out the details of the proposed policy change and seeking Government approval to draft the General Scheme of a bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 has been circulated to other Government Departments for observations.</p></reply>

Some of my Department's highlights for year two are:</p><p><b>Food Wise 2025: </b>Total agri-food exports in 2017 were &euro;13.6bn, an increase of 11% over 2016. Among the achievements in market access included the opening of the Chinese market for beef and that Irish beef sold in the US can now carry the USDA quality mark. </p><p><b>Sustainability: </b>Under the Rural Development Programme, the GLAS (some 50,000 farmers participating), BDGP (some 25,000 farmers participating) and TAMS programmes have all continued to make real contributions to the common goal of Irish sustainability. To date, 337 food and drink companies are verified members of Origin Green.</p><p><b>Brexit: </b>Preparations, including close engagement with stakeholders, are continuing and I provided &euro;50million in supports in Budget 2018. I have also been engaged in an intensified round of bilateral meetings with other Member States.</p><p><b>Access to finance: </b>Following the successful &euro;145 million 'Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme' in 2017, I and my colleagues launched a new &euro;300 million 'Brexit Loan Scheme' for Brexit-impacted SMEs and mid-caps. My Department&rsquo;s funding ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.</p><p><b>Payments:</b>Advance payments of &euro;704 million issued to over 111,000 applicants on the earliest date permissible under EU regulations (16 October), with balancing payments commenced again on the earliest possible date, bringing the total paid to &euro;1.106 billion to 120,700 (98% of all eligible applications). The application process for the 2018 Basic Payment Scheme opened on the 7 February 2018, which is the earliest the application process has opened and is over a month ahead of the opening of the 2017 application process.  This is to provide additional time for farmers and their agents to submit their application online as, under EU regulations, all applications must be submitted online in 2018.  </p><p><b>New CAP: </b>Following on from the European Commission&rsquo;s public consultation on CAP in early 2017, and the CAP Communication on 29 November 2017, my Department commenced its own public consultation on CAP post 2020 with six public meetings, which Minister of State Doyle and I hosted by during February 2018. The public meetings were held regionally throughout the country and were well attended. The submissions are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Commission published its proposals on 1 June. </p><p><b>Trade: </b>In the past year, I led successful trade missions to the USA &amp;amp; Mexico, to Japan &amp;amp; South Korea, Turkey, the USA &amp;amp; Canada and China &amp;amp; Japan. I travelled to the UK as part of the annual series of Irish Government engagements to mark St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, especially significant in the context of Brexit.</p><p><b>Forestry: </b>Increases in afforestation grant and premium rates have been introduced as part of the <i>Forestry Programmes</i>midterm review. A series of promotion activities have been undertaken to highlight forestry as a land use option for farmers.</p><p><b>National Farm Animal Health Strategy: </b>I<b></b>launched The National Farmed Animal Health Strategy 2017-22 in July 2017. The Strategy sets out a comprehensive set of actions for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to work in partnership to achieve optimal animal health in Ireland.<i></i></p><p><b>Seafood:</b>Seafood exports to 72 countries increased by 16% in 2017 to &euro;645 million. Some &euro;28 million was invested in Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector through a suite of 16 schemes under the EMFF Operational Programme.</p></reply>

This is a modern Act and is the main legal instrument available to my Department to enforce animal welfare standards.  The basic rule may be summarised by stating that the person having possession or control of an animal, including a horse, has responsibility for the care and welfare of that animal; it is this person&rsquo;s duty to take all necessary steps to protect the animal from unnecessary suffering and neglect, and not to be reckless regarding the animal&rsquo;s welfare.  There is a specific requirement to ensure that an animal has access to an adequate supply of wholesome food and water.</p>  <p>  The Act  is enforced by authorised officers of my Department based at regional offices around the country, members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, officers of Customs and Excise and authorised officers of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  In addition, the Chief Executive of a local authority may appoint officers of the local authority to be authorised officers within the administrative area of the authority.</p>  <p>  The main powers availed of under the Act are contained in section 38 which provides for extensive powers of inspection and investigation, including in appropriate circumstances, seizure and detention of animals and their retention for use in evidence. Section 42 provides for a system of legally binding notices, the breach of which constitutes a criminal offence. </p>  <p>  The Act provides for a range of penalties that may be imposed.  On summary conviction, an offender may be fined up to &euro;5,000 (a Class A fine) and/or be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of up to 6 months.  On conviction on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;250,000 and or a term of 5 years imprisonment may be imposed. The Court may also, in particular circumstances disqualify a person from owning, keeping,  having charge or control (directly or indirectly) of an animal, or being involved with activities relating to animals for a period, including, where appropriate, for the life of the person. The determination of any particular case is, of course, a matter for the trial court.</p></reply>

The Regulation sets out the fundamental provisions on functional safety and limitations of maximum speed, power, ground clearance, etc.</p>  <p>  The Regulation stipulates that manufacturers shall ensure that vehicles are designed, constructed and assembled so as to minimise the risk of injury to the vehicle occupants and to other road users.  The regulation does not however contain reference to anti roll-bars and protective head gear.  These matters have been examined by both the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and they have concluded that research on the use of anti roll bars on quad bikes has shown that in some cases the risk of injury from use of anti roll-bars may be greater and can lead to a reduction in safety to the user.  </p>  <p>  Both the RSA and the HSA recommend the use of protective head gear when using quads and I fully endorse their recommendations in this regard.  The HSA has actively promoted the use of protective head gear and officials in my Department highlight the importance of its use at every opportunity.</p></reply>

In anticipation of a requirement for the State to purchase carbon credits in partial fulfilment of Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto Protocol and ongoing obligations, the Carbon Fund Act 2007 established a carbon fund for this purpose and empowered the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to undertake such purchases on behalf of the State, under my policy direction in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>Prior to the enactment of the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the State entered into investments in a number of multilateral funds to invest in projects aimed at achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions, namely the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund, managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as well as the Carbon Fund for Europe and Bio-Carbon Fund, both managed by the World Bank.  Ongoing management of these investments is a matter for my Department.  However, since enactment of the Carbon Fund Act 2007, payments in respect of these funds are made by the NTMA through the Carbon Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The ESD established annual emission limits for the period 2013 to 2020 for each EU Member State. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.</p><p>While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, and the consequent increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p><p>The ESD includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States. Using our banked emissions allocations from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2017. However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances. While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required. </p><p>At present Ireland holds a total of 5,329,964 credits (5,255,000 Certified Emission Reductions [CERs] and 74,964 Emission Reduction Units [ERUs]) on behalf of the State in the NTMA Account on the EU Registry, of which 5,265,088 are eligible for compliance under the Effort Sharing Decision.</p></reply>

New waste management targets recently agreed by the European Council include that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2035 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight). </p>  <p>  The continued implementation of European, national and regional waste management policy to manage waste in line with the waste hierarchy will help ensure that Ireland is well placed to meet this new target.</p>  <p>  The potential introduction of economic instruments designed to improve environmental behaviour are being considered in the context of a review of the Environment Fund.</p></reply>

The EPA Progress Report Towards EU Targets 2017 showed that Ireland recycled  34% by weight of plastics in 2015, counting exclusively material that is recycled back into plastics.  The EU target is 22.5% and Ireland is clearly well ahead of this target. </p>  <p>  In January 2018, the European Commission published the European Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy.  The strategy focuses on plastic production and use.  It sets a goal of ensuring all plastic packaging will be recyclable by 2030. </p>  <p>  Since then, I have written to the European Commissioner with responsibility for the environment to welcome the plastics strategy.  I assured him Ireland fully embraced the ambitions of the new strategy.  However I also asked the Commission to focus, in particular, on the most difficult non-recyclable plastics such as soft wrapping, film and single use items such as plastic straws.  I am determined to make sure these products, if they come onto the market here or elsewhere in Europe will be recyclable or compostable and that they will not go into landfill sites. </p>  <p>  I have also welcomed very recent proposals by the European Commission to tackle the problems posed by single-use plastic items, and I am expecting both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to progress these proposals as soon as possible.  I believe that working proactively with our European colleagues will achieve a greater environmental benefit quicker.  </p>  <p>  In line with the potential for European bans and restrictions, I am considering what financial incentives or penalties I can introduce in Ireland, to tackle the problems caused by single-use plastic items in a way that is compatible with EU legislation.</p>  <p>  I am looking to bring forward shortly practical solutions along with my government colleagues responsible for the marine environment and fisheries that will work in an Irish context.</p></reply>

To support home charging, I introduced the Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant scheme this year.  This scheme, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, supports the cost of installing a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600 for buyers of both new and second-hand electric vehicles.  In terms of the number and extent of publicly accessible charging, the National Policy Framework on the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland notes that Ireland's current electric vehicle charging network infrastructure is ahead of current market demand.  However, it is recognised that the future development of electric vehicle public charging needs to progress alongside the growth of electric vehicles.</p><p>The existing fleet of public chargers was rolled out by the ESB, through its eCars programme.A map showing the charge points, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB&rsquo;s website at .  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities approved an application from ESB Networks to recover the costs of this project to a maximum of &euro;25 million from use of system charges. </p><p>Following a public consultation process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published its independent regulatory decision in relation to the future ownership of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in October 2017.  A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges.  This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016.</p><p>The decision also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.  In the absence of State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.  Funding has, therefore, been allocated in my Department's budget this year to support the provision of public charging. </p><p>A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network.  The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and I expect to bring forward proposals that will support the provision of effective and efficient publically accessible electric vehicle charging.</p><p>In this regard, funding for public charging in local communities is already available through the Better Energy Communities Scheme.  The scheme, which is administered by the SEAI, supports community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area.</p></reply>

The NCSC engages with national and international stakeholders, gathering information and  acting as a conduit for sharing this with constituents including operators of Critical National Infrastructure (including electricity and water infrastructure), businesses, and Government Departments and Agencies.  The NCSC also provides expert advice and analysis on cyber security related issues and coordinates responses to significant incidents.  This involves collating and analysing data from cyber-attacks and coordinating with those targeted to introduce mitigation measures.  As such, the NCSC continues to work with utility operators and with similar bodies in other jurisdictions to ensure that risks to infrastructure in Ireland are managed appropriately, including the active management of ongoing issues.  The unit also participates in international Cyber Security training exercises, including a pan European exercise on 6-7 June 2018.  The NCSC is also home to the national Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE) which has received international accreditation and plays an active role in a number of European and international organisations.  The NCSC has been heavily engaged in work to prepare for implementation of the EU Network and Information Security Directive, which places binding security requirements on critical infrastructure operators and certain key Digital Service Providers.  These requirements, which will be legally enforceable, involve a series of technical measures that operators will have to take to secure their systems and to be able to react in the case of an incident.  They will also be obliged to report any serious incidents to the NCSC, which will assist in both national and EU level incident response.</p></reply>

The principal intention behind the proposed (draft) Bye-Law is to give statutory status to the existing policy designation of seven distinctive waters for their management primarily as brown trout waters. </p>  <p>  The seven waters are Lough Sheelin in the Limerick Fishery District, Loughs Conn and Cullin in the Ballina Fishery District, Loughs Corrib, Mask and Carra in the Galway Fishery District and Lough Arrow in the Sligo Fishery District. </p>  <p>  These seven limestone lakes are quite unique in terms of topography and trout habitat and have long been managed as wild brown trout fisheries via established stock management programmes.  From that perspective, these waters are considered especially important. </p>  <p>  The scope of the draft Bye-Law is confined to the seven distinctive State&ndash;owned waters where established stock control measures are already in place.  This represents a small number of the many angling lakes and waters available. </p>  <p>  Submissions from the public consultation are currently being considered before the draft Bye-Law is finalised.  In addition, the proposed Bye-law is subject to legal consultation. </p>  <p>  The complexity of a broader designation of waters and any required management measures, will have to be considered as a matter of primary legislation.  Therefore, I have directed that this matter is to be considered in the context of the major Inland Fisheries Consolidation Bill currently being advanced by the Department.</p></reply>

The aim of the programme is to improve the energy efficiency of our built environment, in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding.  This involves making difficult decisions and targeting supports like limiting eligible homes to those built before 2006 and limiting each home to one grant per type of energy efficiency upgrade. </p><p>Therefore, as new homes are already required to meet specific energy performance standards and to incorporate renewables, grant support is currently focussed on improving the conditions of existing dwellings, and on developing renewables in this area.  Grant funding further works in homes that already possess this level of energy efficiency would not represent a cost-effective use of Exchequer funds.  For information, grant funding for renewable measures under the programme is available to homes built before 2011.</p><p>Neither my Department nor the SEAI is responsible for control of building regulations.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government leads on the Building Control Regulations which require owners, builders and registered construction professionals to demonstrate through the Statutory Register of Building Control Activity that the works or building concerned have been designed and constructed in compliance with Building Regulations.  </p><p>It is current Government policy that under the Better Energy Homes scheme a home cannot receive grant funding twice for the same energy efficiency measure.  In the case cited, this means that since the home in question has already received a grant for cavity wall insulation it is not eligible to receive another grant for any other form of wall insulation.  The rationale for this policy is that applying a second version of wall insulation to a home that has already received one form of wall insulation would result in a lesser amount of energy savings being delivered and since the funds that are available for energy efficiency are limited, I must prioritise their use where they will have the most impact. </p><p>I understand the Deputy's point that in order to encourage the move away from fossil fuels that additional wall insulation may become necessary for some properties that previously received grant funding under the scheme.  This is why homes that have previously received grant aid, but can now meet the criteria for the new Deep Retrofit Pilot scheme (which is supporting householders to make the next step and move off fossil fuels and get their home up to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER)), will be eligible for further funding.

A wide range of waste statistics is available on the EPA website (), including national waste reports and data releases containing information on composting and anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste generated in Ireland.  The most recent data release indicates that the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste, which would include used coffee grinds, sent for composting and anaerobic digestion increased by 19 per cent between 2015 and 2016 (from 194 thousand tonnes to 231 thousand tonnes).  This is a clear indication that the food waste regulations have had a positive impact on increasing the quantity of municipal waste accepted for composting/anaerobic digestion.  The  Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009 place clear obligations on businesses - including coffee outlets, to promote the segregation and recovery of food waste, for purposes of producing energy, compost and digestate, thereby supporting job creation in the waste and bio-energy sectors.  The Regulations also facilitate the achievement of the targets set out in the Landfill Directive (Directive 99/31/EC) for the diversion of bio-degradable municipal waste from landfill sites, by directing source-segregated food waste to composting and to other forms of treatment.</p></reply>

Donegal in July 2017. The report requested is expected to address action taken and recommendations made by DAFM and implemented by the licensee following the report of this large escape.</p><p>In relation to the potential origin of farmed salmon stock captured in the Western River Basin District in 2017, I am advised by IFI that it is not possible to definitively assign the escapees to an individual farm. However the reported average weight of the escapees at the Glinsk Farm in July 2017 was significantly less than the fish recovered in the Western River basin District in August and September 2017 indicating they were at a different stage in the production cycle. The Department of Agriculture Food and Marine, as the competent authority for the regulation of aquaculture, may be best placed to offer a view on this issue.</p><p>Two suspected farmed salmon were captured on the Bunowen river on 8 September 2017. Data on length/weight and scale samples were provided to IFI. Two escaped salmon were captured on the Bundorragha River on 4 September 2017 and handed over to IFI on 5 September.  </p><p>The first escaped farmed salmon was captured on Beat 9 on the Erriff river on 3 September 2017 and handed over to IFI on 9 September. Two escapees were recorded in the upstream trap on the Erriff on 7th September and a third fish was recorded on 24 September. All three fish were retained for analysis. All fish entering the Erriff system upstream of Beat 9 (tidal) must pass through the Erriff trap at Aasleagh Falls where they are monitored.</p><p>IFI completed the report referred to be the Deputy in January 2018.  I am advised that IFI have not been contacted by the Marine Institute in relation to this report</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The Group is chaired by Mr Frank Conway, an independent financial expert.  The membership of the Group also includes a statistician from the Central Statistics Office and Shelfwatch, an independent price monitoring group.  The Group monitors 26 service providers; this comprises 19 individual companies with several of those being monitored in more than one area. I have recently decided to extend the operation of the Price Monitoring Group to the end of the year to continue monitoring pricing developments.The Chair of the Price Monitoring Group, Mr Conway, has recently reported to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that while fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability for householders.  The Price Monitoring Group has reported that there are currently 9 different types of price models on the market. The main price examples include a service charge plus charge per bin lift, with an excess per kg charge, and a service charge plus per kg weight charge. The most popular service offering now is the &lsquo;service charge including weight allowance, plus per kg charge for excess above allowance&rsquo;. </p><p>The Price Monitoring Group is displaying the prices for each company that it monitors and it has published detailed data on the prices it is tracking on a monthly basis. The most recent analysis from April was published on 25 May 2018 and is available on my Department's website. </p><p>The charges applied by waste management companies are subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.</p><p>In line with the commitments set out in <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland, </i>published in 2012, and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention and greater recycling, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection are being phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers contracts come up for renewal. </p><p>The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure. As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced. Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not new for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or a weight related fee. </p></reply>

However, such surveys fall to be assessed under the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Petroleum Exploration) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 134/2013). An assessment is carried out based on the information included in the application to determine whether a survey would require preparation of an Environmental Impact Assessment Report if it is considered that it would result in significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter alia, of the nature, size and location of the survey.</p><p>Applications for seismic surveys are considered against a range of technical and environmental considerations, and in respect of environmental considerations the procedures are as follows:</p><p>The applicant must submit an Environmental Risk Assessment and a Natura Impact Screening (Appropriate Assessment) Statement in support of the application to commence surveying activities including consideration of cumulative effects. These documents are made available on my Department's website.</p><p>The Environmental Risk Assessment is reviewed for my Department by an independent consultancy, with the required expertise in ecological and conservation marine biology, to assess whether or not it meets the scope and quality of requirements set out or implied by the specific European and Irish Environmental Impact Assessment legislation and guidelines.</p><p>The independent consultancy also reviews the Natura Impact Screening Statement to ensure that the requirements of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations, 2011 for an assessment to be carried out on any plan or project likely to have a significant effect on a protected site or species have been met. In addition, the National Parks and Wildlife Service is requested to provide its observations in terms of Natura 2000 sites, where relevant, and Annex IV species (Cetaceans) in accordance with the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).</p><p>Following receipt of these reviews a determination is made as to whether an Environmental Impact Assessment Report or a stage 2 Appropriate Assessment is required.

The draft Bioenergy Plan sets out the policy areas that must be coordinated to support the development of the bioenergy sector in Ireland.  It identifies <font color="#0D0D0D">a range of supply-side and demand-side measures that are needed to release the full potential of the domestic biomass sector in Ireland.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Since the draft Bioenergy Plan was published in 2014, significant progress has been made in finalising the plan and on the actions set out under the plan. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Developments such as the publication of the Energy White Paper, the National Mitigation Plan and the National Policy Statement on the Bioeconomy have provided an updated policy context.  As a result the draft Bioenergy Plan is being updated to reflect these and other policy developments. An updated Strategic Environmental Assessment and NATURA Impact Statement are also currently being finalised. In parallel, progress continues in relation to the key actions set out under the plan. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In this regard, I have secured Government approval for the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat - a key demand-side measure.  I expect the scheme to commence operation later this year subject to State Aid approval.  The objective of the scheme is to increase the level of renewable energy and reduce emissions in the heat sector.  By stimulating demand for renewable energy feedstock, such as biomass, the scheme will provide an opportunity for the growth of indigenous bioenergy production.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In addition, I recently published a Policy Statement outlining the future development of the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.  The scheme has been the primary policy measure used to increase the share of renewable energy in the transport sector and has also made a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The Policy Statement is intended to provide certainty to industry and stakeholders thus facilitating the longer term planning necessary to increase the use of biofuels.  One of the actions is an increase in the Biofuel Obligation Rate to 10% by volume with effect from 1 January 2019.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Supply-side measures, such as support for bioenergy crops, come within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I would highlight the recent significant increase in supports under the Forestry for Fibre Scheme that were made as part of the mid-term review of the Forestry Programme. These supports will provide an increased incentive for those landowners considering planting forestry to supply the energy sector.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">I expect the updated draft Bioenergy Plan and associated assessments to be published for public consultation this summer in order to finalise the plan later this year.</font></p></reply>

TII's remit relates to national roads not regional and local roads.</p>  <p>  Works on regional and local roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by road grants provided by my Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for each Council. </p>  <p>  My Department's regional and local road grant programmes include the Bridge Rehabilitation Grant scheme and the Safety Improvement Works scheme. Under both programmes local authorities submit a list of projects in order of priority for consideration for funding.  Within the constraints of the overall roads budget, allocations are then made to local authorities. The grant allocation to Galway County Council this year includes &euro;100,000 for Bridge Rehabilitation works at Coheenaheeny, Headford on the R333, and &euro;25,000 for Safety Improvement works at Crossura Junction on R333 (main Tuam to Headford road) with the L6134.</p>  <p>  As regards any proposal for upgrading the R333 near Claretuam, before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific Improvement Grants for the strengthening, widening or realignment of rural roads, including bridges, where the proposed scheme cost generally less than &euro;5 million. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The Capital Plan does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific Grant Programme.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific Grant Programme are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.</p></reply>

In this context, grants in the main grant categories, including restoration maintenance, are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area of responsibility and it is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on that basis. My Department allocates funding at local authority level and allocations to individual Municipal Districts are a matter for the Council.  </p>  <p>  I announced the 2018 regional and local road allocations on 29th January and all grant funding available to my Department has now been allocated.  It is a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme taking available grant funding and its own resources into account.

Use of a single form of ID will reduce the burden on both individuals and the administration of the State.</p>  <p>  The Public Services Card (PSC) became an optional form of proof of ID for the National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) from 9 April 2018.  The possibility of the PSC being made mandatory for driving licence/learner permit applications was considered.  However, in line with Government Policy as set out in the eGovernment Strategy 2017 - 2020, while encouraging the use of the PSC, I made clear that it would be necessary to have an alternative to the PSC. The option of using the new NDLS on-line system is being introduced from 5 June, with the alternative of visiting a front office for the purposes of applying for a licence/permit, using the supporting documentation as previously set out in Regulations, remaining in place.</p>  <p>  The total cost to the Road Safety Authority (RSA) of the IT element of the project was some &euro;2 million, along with advertising costs in the range of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000.  While the card is not being made mandatory, I do not regard the advertising costs as wasted, since it did raise awareness of the PSC, the availability of an on-line option for driving licence applications and encourage the use of both.</p>  <p>  At present, to undertake the Driver Theory Test, a PSC is being called for. However, in the interests of consistency, options to the PSC will be catered for. As the Driver Theory Test is operated under contract to the RSA by a private company, I gather that allowing for use of a passport, for example, may involve revisions to that contract.  That is however an operational matter for the RSA.</p></reply>

My Department's high level policy goal for accessible public transport is embodied in the concept of 'Transport Access for All'. This policy is based on the provisions of the Disability Act 2005 and related Government strategies, in particular the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the accessibility retro-fit programme as part of the 4 year capital envelope for public transport announced. An amount of almost &euro;28 million is being made available for accessibility upgrades for existing older infrastructure in the period 2018 to 2021. The additional funding will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet. Under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 there will be continued investment in the retro-fit programme which is managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA).</p>  <p>  Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 the NTA has functional responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network. This includes the provision of wheelchair accessible bus stops in rural and regional areas under the retro-fit programme and any issues in relation to audio and visual communications on the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet. In addition, as the licensing authority for public bus passenger services, the NTA will be in a position to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding licences issued by it to the bus and coach industry.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibilities in this matter, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NTA for direct reply.

This is a long term Strategy with the aim of increasing the number, length and regional spread of greenways across the country. It will set out guidance to project promoters on matters including strategic nature, length, design standards, accommodation works and early consultation with communities and land owners along proposed routes. </p>  <p>  It is important that the National Strategy for the future development of Greenways would be subject to indepth consultation with relevant stakeholders.  That consultation has now been completed and my officials are currently finalising the Strategy.  I expect to publish the Strategy in the coming month.  This will be followed by call for applications later in 2018 with a view to awarding funding to a number of projects for drawdown between 2019 to 2021.  In this regard, I was pleased to secure additional funding for greenways last year bringing the total available for the period 2018 to 2021 to &euro;55.9m. </p>  <p>  Given the increased interest in greenways in recent years I expect that there will be a strong response to this funding call. I would urge potential applicants for funding to progress their planning and design of greenways as far as possible in advance of any application for funding and to resolve any land ownership issues. </p>  <p>  With regard to further funding for the Connemara Greenway, it will be a matter for Galway County Council in the first instance to submit a proposal to my Department, which meets the required criteria, under the upcoming funding call.</p></reply>

A key component in arriving at appropriate runway length is to consider the Maximum Take Off Weight (MTOW) of the aircraft fleet which may operate from the airport.  Once a runway can accommodate the MTOW of an aircraft, a longer runway will not facilitate a greater range; this is down to the aircraft itself.</p>  <p>  In the case of the A330, studies show that North runway at Dublin Airport could accommodate an A330-200 at its Maximum Take Off Weight of 238 tonnes.  It is a matter for airlines how they wish to distribute this weight between passengers, cargo and fuel in order to determine how far the aircraft might fly.  </p></reply>

It does not extend to private properties, or to public parks which are under the jurisdiction of local authorities.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, a "public place" means any public road, and any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge.   </p>  <p>  Scramblers, quad bikes and similar vehicles are mechanically propelled vehicles, which means that they are vehicles intended or adapted for propulsion by mechanical power.  As such, under Road Traffic legislation, the user of a vehicle in a public place must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, and must also wear a helmet, with severe penalties (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) for not being in compliance with these requirements.</p>  <p>  Scramblers and quads are also subject to the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002, and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996.  These regulations prescribe standards in relation to essential matters such as brakes, steering, mirrors, safety glass, wipers, headlamps, rear lighting, indicators and reflectors.</p>  <p>  Although my Department has attended the recent working group convened by the Department of Justice and Equality, there are no indications that any changes will be required to what is already a comprehensive suite of road traffic legislation.  Enforcement of this legislation is entirely a matter for an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The use of such vehicles in parks is outside the remit of this Department; it is a matter for the local authorities to introduce bye-laws prohibiting their use in areas under their control, while the framework legislation for such bye-laws is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. In light of the very serious incident which occurred last week, regarding the use of a scrambler in such places, it is hoped this matter will be given urgent attention by all parties.</p></reply>

My Department's high level policy goal for accessible public transport is embodied in the concept of 'Transport Access for All'. This policy is based on the provisions of the Disability Act 2005 and related Government strategies, in particular the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.</p>  <p>  Accessibility features, such as wheelchair access and audio/visual aids, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage. Newer systems such as LUAS are fully accessible.</p>  <p>  My Department funds an ongoing programme of accessibility improvement grants to upgrade older existing infrastructure and facilities which is managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA). In Budget 2018 I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the accessibility retro-fit programme as part of the 4 year capital envelope for public transport announced. An amount of almost &euro;28 million is being made available for accessibility upgrades in the period 2018 to 2021. The additional funding will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet. </p>  <p>  I intend to improve upon that under the National Development Plan (NDP) over the next ten years and beyond. Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated, accessible and sustainable national public transport system.  A number of key new major public transport programmes are proposed to be delivered under the NDP over the period to 2027 and these will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. In addition, there will be continued investment in the retro-fit programme under the NDP.</p>  <p>  Since becoming a Minister, I have been particularly struck by the personal experiences related to me in my meetings with people with disabilities who use public transport. As a result of wide consultation with members of the disability community and with disability bodies striving to make an impact, I decided that the public transport companies under my aegis should each have at least one board member who has personal knowledge and experience of the needs and difficulties of people with disabilities using public transport. </p>  <p>  The competition for the appointments to the Boards of the NTA, Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail, is being run by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) and the closing date for applications was 27 April last. I expect to be in a position to appoint persons to the Boards in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It is also my intention that a similar appointment should be made to the Board of CI&Eacute;. As well as the public transport companies, I will be appointing a disability advocate to the Board of Sport Ireland and this process is also underway by PAS.</p>  <p>  Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 the NTA has functional responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network, as well as having responsibility for the management of the accessibility retro-fit programme.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibilities in this matter, I have forwarded your question to the NTA for further response to you.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days.</p></reply>

This review highlights  aspects of the 2017 round of the SCP that worked well but also suggests some further improvements which are being considered prior to the next round of the programme opening for applications. Some of these changes require amendments to the Department's online application system and work in this regard has now commenced.

A grant of &euro;65,000 was allocated to the Council for the project under the 2017 Sports Capital Programme. In terms of future Government funding for the development, the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) contains a commitment to establish a new &ldquo;Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund&rdquo; (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100m available over the coming years. It is intended that the Fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount currently available for individual projects under the Sports Capital Programme and all projects will need to be fully compliant with the Public Spending Code and EU State Aid regulations. My officials hope to have the draft terms and conditions of the new scheme finalised shortly and an announcement in relation to when applications will be accepted will be made once this work is complete. At this stage, it is envisaged that the fund will be initially focused on the National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities. Accordingly, it will be open to Dublin City Council to apply for funding under the programme once applications are invited later this year.</p></reply>

In this context, grants in the main grant categories, including restoration maintenance, are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area of responsibility and it is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on that basis.  My Department allocates funding at local authority level and allocations to individual Municipal Districts are a matter for the Council.  </p>  <p>  I announced the 2018 regional and local road allocations on 29th January and all grant funding available to my Department has now been allocated.  It is a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme taking available grant funding and its own resources into account.

Neither my Department not the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing of insurance products.  The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>Insurance Ireland operates a free insurance information service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  All calls regarding refusal to quote, or quotations that are so excessive as to be in effect a refusal, should be directed to Insurance Ireland by phone at (01) 676 1820, by email at declined@insuranceireland.eu or by post at 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.  The Declined Cases Agreement is administered by a committee made up of representatives of insurance companies and includes representatives from the Consumers Association of Ireland and the Financial Services Ombudsman.  All motor insurance providers in Ireland must agree to abide the Declined Cases Agreement under the General Good Requirements for Insurance and Reinsurance Undertakings of the Central Bank of Ireland.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority, in the case of Public Transport, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, in the case of national roads, collect and publish key performance indicators.  These are used by the Department to inform policy and spending decisions.  My Department produces an annual publication,<i>&quot;Transport Trends&quot;</i>,<i></i>which pulls together key data on the transport system from a variety of sources, and provides a very useful overview of the effectiveness and efficiency of the system.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Public Spending Code, all Exchequer spending proposals require a Business Case, which includes Financial and Economic Ex-Ante Evaluations, or Appraisals, of the proposal.  The level of detail required is dependent on the level of expenditure required.  This system ensures that any Exchequer funding on transport delivers value for money for the taxpayer.  To assist in this process for the transport sector, my Department has developed a Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects which is regularly updated, and operates in conjunction with the Public Spending Code, providing detailed guidance on how to appraise the value for money of a proposed project, for submission to my Department and the Department of PER. </p><p>My Department also evaluates ongoing or completed projects and programmes.  Recent evaluations published by my Department include a 2015 Focused Policy Assessment of the Green Schools Programme, a 2015 Value for Money and Policy Assessment of the National Roads Maintenance Programme, and a 2017 Value for Money and Policy Assessment of the Driver Testing Service.

Many transport investments that we intend to undertake nationwide within that 10-year period will be to protect the quality and value of our existing rail-based networks and also the delivery of heavy rail, DART, light rail and metro-based programmes and underlying projects, all to provide additional capacity.  Planning of the large projects (e.g. DART Expansion and MetroLink) is now underway and they are scheduled for delivery progressively over the life-time of the 10-year NDP.  Meanwhile, in the shorter term, various measures and schemes are being taken to ensure more efficient functioning of the rail networks and the provision of additional capacity.  These measures, involving the National Transport Authority (NTA), agencies and railway operators, are as follows:</p>  <p>  -  Completion of the city centre re-signalling project, which allows more train movements across critical parts of the rail network and thereby allows for more and quicker services;</p>  <p>  -  From September 2018, the recently opened Kildare route Phoenix Park tunnel services to Docklands will be extended to off-peak periods, as well as peak periods;</p>  <p>  -  Currently a contract is underway to introduce 28 carriages to re-enter service in 2019; </p>  <p>  -  Later this year, an all-day 10 minute DART service will be introduced across all lines;</p>  <p>  -  Planning for the delivery of the DART Expansion Programme will commence, including, in 2018; beginning the procurement to expand the DART rail fleet; progress the electrification of, the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan; beginning  work on the Maynooth line;</p>  <p>  -  Investment in new train fleet, including a planned move to hybrid diesel-electric trains that can run on both the electrified and non-electrified parts of the rail network and thereby allow passenger services to be upgraded earlier (e.g. introducing higher frequency timetables) without having to wait until the electrification project is fully completed;</p>  <p>  -  Luas-related measures will be implemented to provide additional capacity; A new timetable will be published in June to make best use of the new 55-metre trams that have been introduced with Luas Cross City and also a shuttle service between Heuston and Connolly on the Red Line. </p>  <p>  -  It is intended to add further additional Green Line Luas Capacity, by lengthening the 26 existing trams from 43m to 55m.  The first extended tram will come online in late 2019, and the final by late 2021.  Beyond that it is intended that a further 8 new 55m trams will be delivered and introduced into service. </p>  <p>  All this planned investment, short, medium and long-term, combined will add greatly to the level of service available for the travelling public, connecting more people with more places, easing congestion and combatting climate change.</p></reply>

Sentiment in the industry both overseas and here at home is generally positive for the remainder of 2018.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s aim is to grow overseas tourism revenue by a further 5% this year and to increase the number of overseas visitors by 2%.</p><p>The early signs are promising, with the CSO reporting in its Overseas Travel release that overseas trips to Ireland for the first four months of the year, at over 2.8 million visits, were up 7.3% on 2017, as follows:</p><p>-  Visits from North America were up by 13.6%</p><p>-  Visits from Mainland Europe were up by 12.3%</p><p>-  Great Britain registered an increase of 1.1% in visits, and</p><p>-  Visits from the rest of the world (long-haul) increased by 2.9%.</p><p>While the data only covers four months and it is too early to predict how the rest of the year might fare, it is a welcome start which indicates that we are well placed to build further on the outstanding growth of recent years.  Revenue figures for overseas visitors in Q1 are due to be published this week and should also be positive based on the visitor numbers. </p><p>There is no CSO data published yet for domestic tourism in 2018 but indications are positive following a difficult, weather-related, start to the year.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland reported in its Tourism Barometer in April that hotels have reported a strong performance from the domestic market.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that tourism now supports approximately 235,000 jobs across the country, making it a vital indigenous economic sector and one that supports communities in both rural and urban areas.  Whilst we cannot be complacent about continued growth in tourism, the outlook for the remainder of the year looks positive. </p></reply>

It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting.</p>  <p>  AIM expenditure amounted to &euro;7m in 2016, its first year.  An amount of &euro;22.2m was spent on AIM in 2017 and funding of &euro;25m has been provided for AIM in 2018.</p>  <p>  Since its introduction, the universal elements of AIM have benefitted a large proportion of children in the ECCE programme, both those with disabilities and those without, through training and support to ECCE settings in the provision of inclusive early years care and education. </p>  <p>  Targeted supports directly benefit children with disabilities and may also benefit children without additional needs, for example, where the adult-to-child ratio in the pre-school room is reduced.  In its first year targeted AIM supports were accessed by 2,486 children (accounting for 4,760 different supports), to ensure that they could fully participate in the ECCE programme.  In the second year of AIM from September 2017 to date, targeted AIM supports have been accessed by 3,838 children (accounting for 6,230 different supports), to ensure that they can fully participate in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  Level 7 of AIM provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child's participation in the ECCE Programme.  In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) or equivalent staff.  Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider which the provider may use either to reduce the adult-to-child ratio in the pre-school room by reducing the number of children in the room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.  Neither Pobal nor my Department has a direct role in the recruitment of staff for pre-schools, which are operated independently by either private or not-for-profit entities.</p>  <p>  AIM is not budgeted on a cost-per-child basis, as it combines both universal and targeted supports, and for many children with special needs the universal supports offered under the model will be sufficient.  For others, one particular discrete support may be required to enable participation in the ECCE Programme, such as access to a piece of specialised equipment.  For a small number, a suite of different services and supports may be necessary.  In other words, the model is designed to be responsive to the needs of each individual child in the context of their pre-school setting.</p></reply>

Family Resource Centres are front-line services rooted in the communities they serve. Acting as a focal point within their communities, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their communities. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2017, there were 109 Family Resource Centres in receipt of funding from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. Tusla was provided with additional funding of some &euro;3m in 2018 to expand the programme with the inclusion of 11 additional centres, bringing the total number of Family Resource Centres to 120. </p>  <p>  Tusla administers the Family Resource Centre Programme. As part of the decision making process in choosing 11 new Family Resource Centres to join the Programme, Tusla engaged with local Tusla staff in areas around the country, as well as local Children and Young People's Service Committees (CYPSCs). </p>  <p>  As outlined in my previous response to the Deputy, Tusla has advised me that the quality of applications received was of a very high standard. Tusla has indicated that the organisation to which the Deputy refers is welcome to seek specific feedback on its application from Tusla, with a view to future development.</p>  <p>  Tusla has identified a need for family support services in specified areas of the country, including the Dublin 12 area. Tusla particularly wishes to develop its family support services in disadvantaged areas and will seek to allocate future funding according to the results of needs analysis projects across the country.</p>  <p>  Decisions with regard to funding levels in 2019 will be taken in the context of the Estimates process.  It is not possible therefore at this stage to advise on what level of funding will be available to family support services or the Family Resource Centre Programme next year. However, I strongly value this work, and I will certainly be making the case for a continued investment in family support services in 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

As CCS subsidies are currently paid according to session type, i.e. full-time, part-time, sessional, half-sessional, this maximum weekly universal subsidy rate of &euro;20 is paid on a pro-rata basis according to session type and is not paid on an hourly basis. Please see the following table for a breakdown of the rates per session type.</p><p><table><tr><th>UCS Session Type</th><th>Weekly Subsidy</th></tr><tr><td>Full-time (i.e. 5 hours plus per day)</td><td>&euro;20</td></tr><tr><td>Part-time (i.e. 3 hours 31 minutes to 5 hours per day)</td><td>&euro;10</td></tr><tr><td>Sessional (i.e. 2 hours 16 minutes to 3 hours 30 minutes per day)</td><td>&euro;7</td></tr><tr><td>Half-sessional (i.e. 1 hour 15 minutes to 2 hours 15 minutes per day)</td><td>&euro;3.50</td></tr></table></p><p>The subsidy-rates according to session type are based on a rate of 50 cents per hour, allocated pro-rata depending on the number of hours per week the child attends a childcare service. The maximum rate of &euro;20 per week - for full-time childcare - is based on 40 hours of childcare per week. </p><p>On the basis of the most recent data regarding the number of children availing of the universal payment across all session types and assuming no change in demand, the table below shows estimates of the full year cost of CCSU at the current rate of 50 cent per hour and the projected full year cost of CCSU if increased by 50 cent intervals up to &euro;5 per hour. It should be stressed that the projected full-year cost of &euro;170.8m is based on an assumption that the demand for childcare would not change in response to the increase in the universal subsidy. If the increased subsidy were to lead to an increase in the demand for childcare, then the cost of the measure would rise accordingly.</p><p><b>Table 2 Universal Subsidy (CCSU) rates</b></p><p><table><tr><th>CCSU at</th><th>Full year cost </th></tr><tr><td>50c per hour</td><td>&euro;17,085,831</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;1.00 per hour</td><td>&euro;34,171,663</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;1.50 per hour</td><td>&euro;51,257,495</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;2.00 per hour</td><td>&euro;68,343,327</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;2.50 per hour</td><td>&euro;85,429,159</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;3.00 per hour</td><td>&euro;102,514,991</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;3.50 per hour</td><td>&euro;119,600,823</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;4.00 per hour</td><td>&euro;136,686,655</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;4.50 per hour</td><td>&euro;153,772,487</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;5.00 per hour</td><td>&euro;170,858,319</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, the three ECCE entry points, which were available for the years 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, meant that there were inconsistencies in the number of free preschool weeks; ranging from 61 weeks to 88 weeks depending on the child&rsquo;s date of birth. This was perceived as unfair by many parents. The new measures being introduced from September 2018 will address these inconsistencies and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children and also delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers. </p>  <p>  The number of entry points will revert to one at the beginning of the 2018 programme year (September). This single entry point will support quality service provision principally by making it easier for services to provide continuity of staffing through the programme year. The single enrolment will also help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. This will also make it easier for parents to secure ECCE places for their children.</p>  <p>  While there are no immediate plans to alter the ECCE rules beyond the changes being introduced in September 2018, my Department is currently reviewing the operation of overage exemptions in the scheme. </p></reply>

As part of the process and in accordance with the arrangements in place in my Department for evaluating yearly funding requirements, Tusla is required to submit a detailed business case setting out the basis for its funding requirements. My overriding objective is to realise funding allocations which reflect policy priorities and that sufficient resources are directed towards those areas of greatest impact on children and young people. </p><p>When Tusla was established in 2014, they received an initial allocation of &euro;609 million. On the basis of its annual estimates engagement with the Department, Tusla has received year-on-year increases resulting in an annual allocation for 2018 of &euro;754 million. This represents an overall increase of &euro;145 million or 24% in the period since establishment. Details of the annual funding allocations, including the current and capital resource provisions, are set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2014 </th><th>2015 </th><th>2016 </th><th>2017 </th><th>2018 </th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro;m </td><td>&euro;m </td><td>&euro;m </td><td>&euro;m </td><td>&euro;m </td></tr><tr><td>Current </td><td>602 </td><td>631 </td><td>662 </td><td>699 </td><td>740 </td></tr><tr><td>Capital </td><td>7 </td><td>12 </td><td>14 </td><td>14 </td><td>14 </td></tr><tr><td>Allocation </td><td>609 </td><td>643 </td><td>676 </td><td>713 </td><td>754 </td></tr></table></p><p>The extra resources allocated to Tusla has significantly strengthened its base funding, facilitated the agency in meeting identified service pressures and areas of particular risk. In line with statutory requirements under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla publishes its annual business plan which outlines proposed activities and performance targets for each year which includes proposed allocation of the total resources (both financial and human).</p></reply>

It was chaired by the Tusla CEO.</p>  <p>  The expert panel has concluded its work. When I examined its findings, I decided to carry out some further discussions with a number of other stakeholders. To this end I hosted a very informative School Completion Consultation event in Farmleigh House on January 29th last. </p>  <p>  Matters discussed included best practice and governance within the School Completion Programme. There was a range of views expressed as to how both these elements could be improved to ensure that the best service possible is delivered to those who need it. </p>  <p>  Following the Farmleigh event I have asked the facilitator for the day to do some additional work on a possible way forward, I have received this input very recently. </p>  <p>  I have deliberated carefully over this process for some time because the issues are complex and I want to achieve the best possible results for the young people who use the service and for the professionals who deliver it. I wish to see plans for the development of the SCP advanced in this quarter.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the positive outcomes that have been achieved within the School Completion Programme. </p>  <p>  For example, the proportion of students in DEIS schools who completed the senior cycle has increased from 68% in 2006/2007 to 82% by 2016. This illustrates the benefit of the programme.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and Tusla Educational Welfare Service are fully committed to the future of the School Completion Programme and will continue to work to ensure that it will deliver the best possible outcomes for young people at risk of early school-leaving.</p></reply>

The National S&iacute;olta Aistear Initiative provides funding for mentors in City/County Childcare Committees and Voluntary Childcare Organisations to offer mentoring and quality improvement supports to early years settings. The primary purpose of the initiative is to increase awareness, understanding and implementation of the S&iacute;olta national quality framework and the Aistear curriculum framework. &euro;500,000 was allocated to the Initiative in 2017.</p><p>The cost of extending quality supports to non-registered childminders cannot be readily estimated because of the lack of firm data on the number of childminders. An expert working group on childminding, which submitted a report to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in March 2018, estimated that there may be approximately 35,000 childminders, but noted that the figure is an estimate because the very large majority of childminders are outside the statutory regulatory system. Fewer than 120 childminders are currently registered with Tusla.</p><p>The expert working group's report, <i>Pathway to a Quality Support and Assurance System for Childminding, </i>outlines a vision for the development of the childminding sector in Ireland over the next decade, and sets out short, medium and longer-term recommendations. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is currently considering the recommendations contained in the report, with a view to developing an action plan within the next year for the wider regulation and support of the childminding sector, including supports for the quality of childminding practice.</p></reply>

Piloting Baby Boxes is just one initiative which will be part of a wide ranging strategy that will address various aspects of the lives of babies and young children under 6 years old and their families including supports to balance working and caring of children, developments in early childhood care and education and health initiatives.</p>  <p>  A Baby Box is intended to welcome a new arrival to a family and acknowledge a very significant moment for parents.  Key objectives with the Baby Box and linked communications will be to support parents through information on baby development and early learning, advice on breastfeeding and promotion of infant safety.  Distribution of a Baby Box is also an early opportunity to link parents in with support services if required. This is consistent with the principle of progressive universalism whereby all families receive something, but where there are additional needs, extra supports are provided.</p>  <p>  The concept of Baby Boxes originates in Finland, and has been implemented in a number of other countries including Scotland, and consists of a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood including safety items, baby clothes and toys and books to support early development. The pilot project will undertake research and consultation with child development experts and with parents to determine items for inclusion in the pack and accompanying information resources.  There will be a significant emphasis in the pilot on evaluation of impact and cost-benefit analysis of the measure with a view to determining whether the initiative is suitable for wider roll out.</p></reply>

The cases were identified during an analysis of adoption records that were transferred to Tusla by the former adoption society St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.</p>  <p>  It was during the course of working with these records and in particular the scanning of them that the issue of incorrect birth registrations was identified, with clear evidence of this practice recorded on index cards created and maintained by St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.  On foot of this discovery Tusla informed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Mother and Baby Home Commission of Investigation and my Department.  I moved immediately to inform the Cabinet, and to announce that a process has been put in place by Tusla to deal with these cases, led by experienced information and tracing social workers.  </p>  <p>  As an immediate step, Tusla put in place a Helpline, operating from 10 to 4 each day, Monday to Friday, and also put significant information on its website.  Both provide information in relation to what to expect if you are one of the people affected by the incorrect registrations that have been identified in the records of St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild. </p>  <p>  A social worker-led process of making contact with those affected that can be identified has commenced.  This includes the person who was incorrectly registered (the child), the birth mother and the people who participated in the incorrect registrations and subsequently raised these children as their own.  </p>  <p>  Each of the 126 cases has been assigned an experienced information and tracing social worker and the cases have been prioritised.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that responding to these 126 cases will put Tusla's information and tracing services under pressure and as the Deputy is aware, there is already considerable demand for this service.  </p>  <p>  The appropriate mechanism to address resource issues is through the normal annual budgetary process.  I would expect any additional resource requirements arising for Tusla in this, or in any other, service to be addressed in that context.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that the process will be measured, sensitive, and at the pace of the individual concerned.  There will be no sudden phone calls or unannounced visits to people&rsquo;s doors.  The process of offering contact and supporting those affected will be handled very carefully and will take account of the requirements of the individuals.</p></reply>

It highlights progress on the specific plans put in place to tackle issues, in the short and longer terms. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided updates on the status of the implementation of the Programme for Partnership Government in the areas of rural and regional development, job creation and broadband.  </p>  <p>  Realising our Rural Potential, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development, was published in January 2017.  The Plan contains over 270 actions for delivery across a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other organisations over a three-year period. </p>  <p>  The Second Progress Report, published in May 2018, shows a 93% implementation rate of the actions across Government which were due for delivery in 2017, initiatives which are supporting the economic and social progress of rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  Further detailed information on individual programmes and commitments are provided below.  </p>  <p>  -  &euro;21.6m funding was allocated to 281 rural towns and villages across the country under the 2017 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, bringing to over 450 the total number of projects supported by the Government under this scheme since the second half of 2016.</p>  <p>  -  900 projects to the value of &euro;15m have been approved for funding under the CL&Aacute;R programme since it was re-launched in 2016.</p>  <p>  -  &euro;13.6m was approved for 240 projects under the 2017 Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme to improve walking trails, greenways and other recreational amenities.</p>  <p>  -  The Greenway strategy is being developed by DTTAS and our Department will be meeting with DTTAS to discuss and provide OBs on the draft strategy shortly.</p>  <p>  -  &euro;17m 2017 and 2018 Local Improvement Scheme for the improvement of non-public rural roads.</p>  <p>  -  Over 1,000 LEADER projects have been approved to date for funding in excess of &euro;29 million towards enterprise development, job creation and the development of sustainable community infrastructure across rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  -  A comprehensive review of progress made by the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in 2017 was published this February alongside a new 2018 work programme.  Key developments highlighted in the 2017 Review include a mobile phone blackspots mapping exercise; broadband officers now in every local authority, increasing the levels of communication between local authorities and industry; identification of roadside sites for masts; and increased availability of consumer information by ComReg.</p>  <p>  -  A new SICAP Programme covering the five-year period from 2018 to 2022 is now in place.  Under the new Programme, Local Community Development Committees are now given the opportunity to identify their own emerging needs group to more efficiently target supports within their local area. </p>  <p>  -  A new Communities Facilities Scheme was launched in 2017.  A recast RAPID programme was also launched in 2017.  Each of these had funding of &euro;2m, which was channelled through Local Community Development Committees.  Following a review in 2018 these schemes were amalgamated to form the Community Enhancement Programme.  This programme, with an increased budget of &euro;4.5m, provides support to disadvantaged communities in the same way as the two previous schemes but is more flexible and easier to administer.</p>  <p>  -  Following a review, a new version of the Seniors Alert Scheme was launched in November 2017.  The new Scheme includes an extension of the eligibility criteria to include elderly people who live on their own for long periods during the day and the introduction of free monitoring for the first year, following which a small charge will apply.  By end December 2017, over 21,000 applications have been approved and some 18,000 installations were made.  For 2018, &euro;2.3m has been allocated for this programme, with almost 8,000 installations completed by end April 2018.  </p>  <p>  -  The Department has recently agreed a three-year contract with SIFI, which commenced on 1 June 2018, which includes a continued commitment to match philanthropic funding raised by SIFI with State funding.  The Dormant Account Programme for 2018 includes an allocation for the ongoing operation of the current programme.</p>  <p>  -  In January, &euro;3.5m was allocated under the Supports for the Community Voluntary Programme to volunteer centres in 21 counties as well as a number of national organisations, including Volunteer Ireland.</p>  <p>  -  The Atlantic Economic Corridor Taskforce is progressing areas of work relating to enterprise space, infrastructure, and communications.  In March 2018 co-funding by DRCD was announced for each of the 10 City and County Councils along the corridor to support the designation of Atlantic Economic Corridor Officers who will support the work of the Taskforce.</p>  <p>  -  The Western Development Commission is represented on the Monitoring Committee for the Action Plan for Rural Development and on the Implementing Committees which oversee the delivery of the Action Plans for Jobs for the West and North-West regions.</p>  <p>  -  The Commission is also represented on the Taskforce to progress the development of an Atlantic Economic Corridor area along the western seaboard.  The Western Development Commission has been a key contributor to sub-groups of this Taskforce.</p>  <p>  -   A Cross-Sectoral Working Group has been established to assist in the development of the implementation plan for the Framework Policy to support the community and voluntary sector and local development sectors.  A new five-year multi-annual implementation plan for the Framework Policy on Local and Community Development will be submitted to Government for approval in Q3 2018.</p></reply>

The programme provides funding to enhance facilities for disadvantaged communities. The programme replaces and builds on two existing schemes (Communities Facilities Scheme and the RAPID).

Kerry will receive &euro;142,409, which is an increase on the 2017 combined allocation (from CFS and RAPID) of &euro;129,000.  Although some of the available funding is ring-fenced to provide small capital grants of &euro;1,000 or less, the programme can, where appropriate, fund or partially fund larger scale capital projects.  </p>  <p>  The group referenced may be eligible for funding under this programme.

There is no contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department.  The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after they have reached an agreement with their landlord regarding their tenancy arrangement.

Under this Act, a person cannot be discriminated against by a landlord on the basis that they are in receipt of rent supplement; the housing assistance payment scheme; or any other social welfare payment.

Those who accept direct provision are provided with accommodation, food and health services together with other facilities and services designed to ensure their needs are met while seeking the protection of the State.  All costs for this are borne by the State.</p>  <p>  The direct provision allowance (DPA) is a non-statutory payment paid by my Department on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality to protection applicants living in the direct provision system.  The weekly rate of DPA for children and adults is &euro;21.60.  The Government has provided over &euro;5.6 million for the allowance in 2018. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 3,700 adults and 1,600 children residing in the system of direct provision in respect of whom the direct provision allowance is being paid.  The additional full-year cost, based on the current numbers, of doubling the weekly rate to &euro;43.20 per week would cost some &euro;5.95 million. </p>  <p>  The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants and who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  It is payable at the rate of &euro;196 per week, with increases for qualified adults and children paid at the rates of &euro;131.40 and &euro;31.80 respectively.  As protection seekers are provided with accommodation, food and other services, which recipients of SWA do not receive, it would not be appropriate to increase the rate of DPA in line with SWA.   The rate of DPA for adults was increased from &euro;19.10 to &euro;21.60 in August 2017 while the rate for children increased from &euro;9.60 to &euro;15.60 in January 2016 and to &euro;21.60 in August 2017.</p>  <p>  Any further increases to the rate of direct provision allowance would have to be approved by Government and considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

We wanted to see more private commercial operators joining the scheme for the first time, existing participants adding more routes and operators returning to the scheme where they had previously withdrawn.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, private operators are compensated directly by the Department, to a level which equates to approximately 70% of the estimated average fare charged by these operators to full fare paying passengers.  In order to ensure that private commercial bus operators are being fairly compensated the Department requests relevant companies to conduct passenger surveys.  Based on survey results the Department makes adjustments to payments to private operators to ensure adequate compensation is provided, and the additional Budgetary allocation facilitates that.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the additional Budgetary provision also allowed for the arrangements for Bus &Eacute;ireann - Expressway to be brought into line with those of other commercial operators participating in the scheme. The discount applied on free travel payments to Bus &Eacute;ireann- Expressway was reduced from 40% to 30%, putting Bus &Eacute;ireann - Expressway on an equal footing with other commercial operators participating in the free travel scheme.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;35 million was spent on the free travel scheme up to the end of May 2018.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities under the scheme, and as part of the social welfare budget package for 2018, I announced an increase in the weekly rate of payment for participants from March together with an additional 250 places.  Taking into account the 500 additional places already allocated as part of the social welfare Budget 2017, this brings the total number of RSS places to 3,350, nearly 30% of an increase in the last two years. </p>  <p>In March 2018, the 250 additional places were allocated to the Implementing Bodies (IBs), who deliver the scheme on behalf of the Department taking a number of factors into consideration including the number of places already allocated, the demand for places in particular areas, work opportunities available within communities and the numbers of farmers and fishermen in receipt of income support.  As of 8th June 2018, there were 2,981 places filled and my Department continue to work closely with the IBs to ensure all places are filled.   </p>  <p>  The 2018 budget provision for RSS is &euro;51.04m which is an increase of &euro;6.6m on the 2017 outturn on the scheme.  Up to the end of May 2018, the total expenditure on the scheme has been &euro;21.9m.  Recent budgets have been forward looking, allocating limited resources in a prudent way, to make sure that everyone benefits from the recovery. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes the cost of increasing the qualified adult rate for those on the &euro;107.70 rate to &euro;131.40 per week.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of increasing the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment for 25 year olds on the &euro;152.80 weekly rate to the maximum weekly rate of &euro;198 per week would be &euro;6.34 million in 2019.  </p>  <p>  The full year cost of increasing the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment for 18-24 year olds on the &euro;107.70 weekly rate to &euro;152.80 per week would be &euro;37.39 million in 2019.  This includes the cost of increasing the qualified adult rate for those on the &euro;107.70 rate to &euro;131.40 per week.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that these estimated costs are subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2019.  </p>  <p>  Lower weekly rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were introduced to protect young people from welfare dependency by providing them with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment. Where a young jobseeker participates on an education or training programme they will receive the higher weekly rate of &euro;198 which is the maximum personal rate for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. </p>  <p>  The reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance do not apply to 18 -25 year olds with a qualified child, those making a claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance where that claim is linked to a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied, those transferring directly to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance from disability allowance, or young jobseekers on certain training programmes.  The reduced rates also do not apply to 18-24 year olds who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) during the period of 12 months before they reached the age of 18. </p>  <p>  The appropriate rate of all weekly social welfare payments, including the rate for young jobseekers, will be considered by the Government in the context of budgetary deliberations.</p></reply>

The effectiveness of the Working Family Payment  is currently being reviewed, along with the effectiveness of other employment and income supports.<br /><br />Other measures which were targeted at low-income families include a &euro;20 weekly increase in the earnings disregard for the One Parent Family Payment and the Jobseekers&rsquo; Transitional Payment, from &euro;110 to &euro;130 per week.  This is in addition to the &euro;5 increase in the personal weekly rate of payment and the &euro;2 per week increase in the qualified child payment.  The Back to Work Family Dividend which was due to close to new applications in March 2018 has been retained.  The payment value has increased to &euro;31.80 per child in line with the increase in the payment for qualified children announced in Budget 2018.  </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;Reducing poverty levels by supporting an increase in the minimum wage to &euro;10.50 per hour over the next 5 years.  We will rely on the annual recommendations of the Low Pay Commission on the level of adjustment each year.&rdquo;</td><td>In line with the recommendation from the Low Pay Commission, the national minimum wage was increased by 30 cent to &euro;9.55 per hour from 1 January 2018.<br /><br />The Government has also accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission regarding the allowance provided for board and lodging, resulting in a change from a weekly/daily rate to an hourly figure.  This measure is of benefit to those on the minimum wage who are working part-time hours and where board is provided by the employer.  </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;We will tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work that prevents workers from being able to save or have any job security.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;We will strengthen regulation on precarious work.&rdquo;</td><td>On 2 May 2017 the Government approved the priority drafting of a Bill to address zero hour contracts, low hour contracts, banded hours and related matters.                   <br /><br />The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was published on 7 December 2017. Second Stage of the Bill was completed in the D&aacute;il on 15th February 2018. Committee Stage was completed on the 17th May 2018. Report Stage is expected to take place in the coming weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;Develop[ing] a new Integrated Framework for Social Inclusion, to tackle inequality and poverty.&rdquo;</td><td>A public consultation process in relation to a new National Action Plan/Integrated framework for Social Inclusion commenced in February 2018.  Consultation with other Ministers has also been undertaken.  Publication of the new Plan is now envisaged in Q3 2018.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; [to]  publish a dedicated &lsquo;Pathways to Work for Jobless Households&rsquo; to support jobless households into employment.&rdquo;</td><td>The Action Plan on Jobless Households was published in August 2017 and aims, by 2020, to reduce the proportion of households that are jobless to 13% or less, and reduce the share of the 18-59 population resident in such households to less than 8%.<br /><br />Progress has been made on implementing the plan. In particular, Budget 2018 increased financial supports for working families through increasing earnings disregards and thresholds on the Working Family Payment and the Jobseekers Transition Payment; extending the life of the Back to Work Family Dividend, which was due to close to new entrants in March 2018; and increasing the national minimum wage.  A wide-ranging consultation process has been undertaken with people with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, and sectoral representatives.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;actively encourage payments at Post Offices. &ldquo;</td><td>All DSP staff were advised of the PfG commitment and reminded that customer wishes should be facilitated where appropriate when they wish to receive their payment at the Post Office.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;the rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme, which is providing simple microloans to members and helping to combat the use of moneylenders&rdquo;</td><td>Over 6,000 people are currently making Personal Micro Credit loan repayments via An Post with an unknown additional number (estimated at approximately 10%) making repayments by direct debit or standing order. <br /><br />To date, 107 Credit Unions at 254 locations are signed up to participate in the scheme. <br /><br />Engagement is continuing with the Credit Union representative bodies and individual credit unions to encourage wider national coverage.  </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; invest in new services and caseworkers to support jobseekers through the network of local Intreo offices..&hellip; support a regional approach to Intreo offices &hellip; review work activation and social welfare schemes to ensure that schemes do not contain anomalies that may impact unfairly on people in rural areas, including farmers.&rdquo;</td><td>The Department&rsquo;s 62 Intreo offices are located throughout the country and are managed on a regional basis. The Intreo network is managed by 10 regional managers at Principal Officer level who deliver services and supports in line with the needs of their particular region. (Positive changes relating to the Rural Social Scheme and the Farm Assist scheme are set out below.)</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; extend the Dental Treatment Benefit under the Social Insurance Fund to reimburse the cost of some routine dental treatments.&rdquo;  </td><td>The range of benefits available under the Treatment benefit scheme (dental and optical) was extended as announced in Budget 2017.  The existing benefits were extended to self-employed contributors from 27 March 2017 and the optical scheme was restored in full from 28 October 2017; with a scale and polish or protracted periodontal treatment also reintroduced on the dental benefit scheme from 28 October 2017.  The Department introduced a new system in October 2017 to support the administration of the scheme and also put in place a web portal (WelfarePartners) to support dentists, opticians and audiologists in transacting business (e.g. checking eligibility and submitting) online. </td></tr><tr><td>&hellip;&rdquo; the Departments of Health and Social Protection [to] work together to pursue a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; to support more people to get back to work if they have an illness or disability.&rdquo; </td><td>DEASP and D/Health have identified &ldquo;Healthy You: Early Intervention&rdquo; as the working title of the programme to reflect widespread evidence that early intervention in a person&rsquo;s illness or health condition through a range of services and supports can lead to positive health, employment and income results. <br /><br />A working group has been established  to promote a pilot project of early engagement with people with low back pain who are on sick leave from work, and develop a programme for health education and/or intervention with the aim of managing their condition/facilitating early recovery and return to work. The finer details of the pilot in terms of sample size, location, support services, resources and levels of intervention are currently being finalised. </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo; &hellip;to introduce flexibility and support in the social welfare system for people with severe and enduring mental health difficulties to transition into employment by ensuring a seamless return of their entitlements should a particular employment opportunity prove unsuitable. &hellip;. [and]  &hellip;address concerns surrounding the loss of secondary benefits, so that people are always better off in work.&rdquo;</td><td>The Make Work Pay (MWP) report for People with Disabilities, published in April 2017, identified the need for flexibility in both the income support and the health (medical card) systems.  This is particularly the case where a person with a disability takes up a job but that job does not work out.  Anxiety in such circumstances can be particularly pronounced amongst those with mental health issues, given the episodic nature of such conditions. In line with a recommendation of the MWP report, a fast-track return to disability allowance protocol has been put in place.  In addition to this initiative, people who are participating on the partial capacity benefit scheme may return to illness benefit or invalidity pension if they find that they cannot continue to work.<br /><br />Most recently, the Department participated as a partner organisation in the Integrating Employment and Mental Health Service project, which ran between 2015 and 2017.  The aim of this project was to demonstrate how existing employment services (specifically the EmployAbility service) could practice the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment for clients with severe and enduring mental health issues.  An evaluation report, Steps into Work, was launched by on the 8th February 2018 and found that through improved integration between mental health services and employment support services, improvements can be achieved in the employment outcomes of people with mental health difficulties. <br /><br />DEASP is now collaborating with the Department of Health and the HSE to extend the availability of IPS to all Mental Health Services in each Community Healthcare Organisation.  This will see funding from the HSE Service Reform Fund (SRF) and funding from the HSE&rsquo;s Clinical Programmes for 27.5 IPS employment specialists for a three year period.  </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; consolidate all means testing under a single national body ensuring a single application process for services or entitlements across all government agencies.&rdquo;</td><td>It is recognised that this would be a major project across a range of Government departments and agencies, including DEASP, that operate schemes and services on a means/income tested basis. Significant operational, legislative and technical challenges would be involved.  <br /><br />IT developments in the DEASP in recent years have allowed for the capture and storage of means data and the reuse of that data.  Amongst the many potential benefits of this reuse are a reduced administrative burden on staff and customers through greater accuracy of information, a reduced need to repeatedly ask for the same information and the ability to make better-informed decisions regarding reviews.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; an increase in the Disability Benefit and Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Allowance, and Blind Person's Pension&ldquo;  &hellip;. &ldquo;increase the State Pension and the Living Alone Allowance above the rate of inflation.&rdquo;</td><td>As announced in Budget 2018, the maximum rate of weekly social welfare payments - including State pensions, disability allowance and carer&rsquo;s allowance -  increased by &euro;5 per week from end-March 2018.  This builds on a similar increase in Budget 2017.  There was also a &euro;2 increase for each qualified dependent child, effective from end-March 2018, the first such increase since 2010.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; support and expand supported employment opportunities and work with stakeholders to make supported employment more attractive to both prospective employers and employees.&rdquo; </td><td>DEASP delivers assistance with the identification and take-up of supported employment opportunities for people with disabilities through its EmployAbility service. An evaluation of this service has been completed and a number of proposals to improve the operation of the service are currently being considered.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; highlight incentives for employers to employ a person with a disability, roll out a national awareness campaign&rdquo;</td><td>Information on supports available for the employment of persons with a disability are available on an ongoing basis at events taking place all over the country, including employer briefings.   For instance, a Disability Awareness and Support event was recently held in Tralee, at which stakeholders engaged in the disability arena, including the National Learning Network (NLN) and Employability, provided information on services available including training, grants, equipment etc.  The Education and Training Board was also in attendance.  There were 400 visitors to the event which included clients with a disability, parents and carers.  <br /><br />The DEASP has recently completed a major consultation exercise with disability stakeholders following the recommendations of the Make Work Pay report and the issue  of how best to engage with employers in order to improve employment opportunities for persons with disabilities will be further considered in light of that exercise. .<br /><br />The mission outlined in the DEASP Employer Relations Strategy has broadened from  'to build effective relationships with employers with the aim of increasing recruitment activity and, in particular, &ldquo;increasing placements into employment from the Live Register &quot; to &quot;increasing placement into employment of the Department&rsquo;s clients&quot; to reflect the inclusion of people with a disability. The Strategy also commits to fully integrate the provision of employer services within Intreo Centres.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; fully protect the Free Travel pass for all pensioners.&rdquo;</td><td>The Free Travel scheme is fully protected. An additional &euro;10m is being invested in the scheme to encourage new operators into the scheme and to encourage a broadening of coverage in more remote parts of rural Ireland.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;in recognition of the vital role of schemes such as the Rural Social Scheme, Community Employment Schemes, BTEA and Farm Assist in rural communities and in activating the unemployed, &hellip;to make suitable recommendations to strengthen provision in this area&hellip;&rdquo;</td><td>Budget 2018 provides for 250 additional places on the Rural Social Scheme, increasing the number to 3,350 in 2018.  The distribution of the additional 250 RSS places was announced on Friday 23 March 2018.  The Implementing Bodies (Local Development Companies) have started recruitment for the places allocated.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo; Review &hellip; the Farm Assist Scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low income.&rdquo;</td><td>Budget 2017 introduced important changes to the Farm Assist scheme, which included assessing 70% of farm income (down from 100%) and re-introducing income disregards for children.  Budget 2018 provided for a &euro;5 increase in the rate of farm assist payable from 26th March, bringing the maximum personal rate of farm assist payable from &euro;193 per week to &euro;198 per week.</td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip; review the Fish Assist scheme in recognition of the irregular earning patterns of fishermen, in an effort to respond to difficult financial circumstances.&rdquo;</td><td>The Budget 2017 improvements to the Farm Assist scheme were also applied to the Fish Assist scheme.  Claimants of Fish Assist have also benefited from the increase of &euro;5 per week since 26th March 2018. </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;. develop a system that fosters independence through retraining and employment &hellip;provide the resources to invest in services that protect the weakest and most vulnerable in our society from poverty and exclusion.&rdquo;</td><td>The Action Plan for Jobless Households was published in September 2017. Budget 2018 implemented a number of the measures envisaged in relation to work incentives; a major consultation &ndash; with people with disabilities, their parents, and representative bodies -- on reforms to disability payments was launched in February 2018; pilot delivery of employment services to adult dependants of jobseekers&rsquo; claimants will commence in Q2 2018. </td></tr><tr><td>&ldquo;&hellip;carry out an immediate review of the financial supports available to the unemployed or those returning to the education system to ensure the greatest possible uptake of continuing education by eliminating current barriers.&rdquo;</td><td>DEASP has commissioned a study to explore the drivers of negative employment outcomes of participants on the Back to Education Allowance Scheme with a view to informing the scheme direction.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It was decided after a process of consultation that the initiative would apply to members of Visual Arts Ireland (VAI) and the Irish Writers Centre (IWC).</p><p>A key feature of the initiative is that it acknowledges the status of self-employed artists and writers and gives them a 12 month window to focus on building up their work before they become subject to labour market activation services provided by my Department.

In summary, any income, with some exceptions, belonging to the person is assessable as means for DA purposes. </p>  <p>  Another condition for receipt of DA is that a person has an injury, disease or physical or mental disability that has continued (or may be expected to continue for at least one year) and that as a result of this disability, is substantially restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of his/her age, experience and qualifications.  </p>  <p>  The DA scheme is structured to encourage recipients to avail of opportunities to engage in rehabilitative work where this is appropriate, either in self-employment or in insurable employment. When an individual engages in rehabilitative work, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;120 per week, and 50% of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are also disregarded, for the purpose of the means test. </p>  <p>  Where the DA recipient commences self-employment, we require them to indicate when they are starting and the type of work involved. We also request that they keep full records of their income and expenses from the date on which the self-employment commences. This is to ensure that the appropriate evidence is available to a deciding officer to calculate the average earnings over the period most appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of each case. </p>  <p>  Approval must first be sought from my Department in order for the work to be considered as rehabilitative. The term &lsquo;rehabilitative&rsquo; is not defined in legislation and is broadly interpreted in administrative practice as including appropriate work that would be regarded as good for the person and would be expected to result in more positive outcomes in symptom levels, self-esteem, quality of life and social functioning.  In all cases the recipient must forward a letter from their own doctor indicating that the work is rehabilitative. </p>  <p>  The Make Work Pay (MWP) report for people with disabilities, published in 2017, made a number of recommendations including that the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative nature&rsquo; for the DA earnings disregard should be dispensed with. This would mean that a report from a doctor would no longer be required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity. Legislation is required to give effect to this change and is included in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Section 19 transposed Article 7 of the original EU Working Time Directive (93/104/EC) &ndash; now consolidated by Directive 2003/88/EC.  Under section 19 of the 1997 Act, an employee acquires an entitlement to 4 weeks&rsquo; annual leave if he or she works at least 1,365 hours in a leave year, or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours, or 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks). </p>  <p>  The 1997 Act also provides for 9 public holidays in addition to the statutory annual leave entitlements.  </p>  <p>  Any annual leave entitlements in the contract of employment over and above the statutory minimum will be a matter for negotiation between the employer and employee.</p>  <p>  As the legislation on annual leave emanates from an EU Directive, national legislation on annual leave will be affected by rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in cases taken under the EU Working Time Directive.  Some of the most significant of these CJEU rulings relate to the accrual of annual leave entitlement during sick leave.  These rulings were formally transposed into Irish law by section 86(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 which amended the annual leave provisions in the 1997 Act.  The amendments to the 1997 Act provided as follows:</p>  <p>  - Employees accrue statutory annual leave entitlement while on certified sick leave. </p>  <p>  - An annual leave carryover period of 15 months after a leave year will apply to those employees who could not, due to illness, take annual leave during the relevant leave year or during the normal carryover period of 6 months.</p>  <p>  - On termination of employment, payment in lieu of untaken accrued annual leave will apply to leave which was untaken as a result of illness in circumstances where the employee leaves the employment within a period of 15 months following the end of the leave year during which the statutory leave entitlement accrued.</p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor any developments at EU level in relation to annual leave entitlements.  For the time being, I have no plans to increase the current statutory entitlement, which is, as I have said, a minimum level of leave above which employers and employees are free to agree better terms.</p>  <p>  It is worth my pointing out, for information, that the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) provides general information on employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, through the Workplace Relations Information and Customer Service Unit which can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059-9178990 or via its website www.workplacerelations.ie. </p></reply>

As at 30 April 2018, the number of Departmental customers in payment with a PSC was 1.63 million persons.</p>  <p>  The majority of these SAFE registrations are through attendance in person at the local INTREO Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office. Customers may be invited to attend, or can make contact themselves to arrange an appointment or make an appointment online. There are over 100 SAFE registration locations nationally. It is the intention that, in due course, registration would be available at all departmental locations. </p>  <p>  Arrangements are also in place for other persons, mainly pensioners in receipt of payments at Post Offices, who can complete SAFE registration and access a PSC by postal methods. Customers who fulfil the relevant criteria are written to offering this option. This procedure provides a more convenient method of registration for these individuals. Over 300,000 customers have availed of this option.  If the Deputy is aware of a particular case which might fulfil the relevant criteria in regard to this option, I will ask my officials to make contact with the individual concerned.  </p>  <p>  Having regard to mobile SAFE registrations, these are carried out specifically on request and usually at community/group settings to register customers unable to attend in person at DEASP locations due to mobility, disability or incapacity challenges.  </p>  <p>  The primary legislative provisions for SAFE registration and identity verification are set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended).  The legislation requires a person to satisfy the Department as to their identity and ultimately allows for disallowance or disqualification from receipt of a benefit in the event that it is not done.  </p>  <p>  The Department makes it clear to customers in receipt of social welfare payments or Free Travel entitlements that they need to complete a SAFE 2 registration to access, or continue to access, payments and entitlements.  </p>  <p>  The Department also issues reminder letters to customers, as required.  Customers may also book a different time/date to suit them, either online via www.mywelfare.ie, by contacting the Department&rsquo;s offices, or by walking in to ask for the next available appointment. </p>  <p>  In this context, I want to make it clear that customers who face bona fide challenges to in-person attendance will not be disadvantaged, in terms of access to or eligibility for payments and/or availing of Free Travel entitlements.</p>  <p>  The decision to stop a payment is never made lightly and the Department will consider all elements of eligibility to that particular payment or entitlement. However, where a customer does not satisfy the Department in relation to identity in line with legislative requirements, a payment can be disqualified.  In advance of any such disqualification, the Department makes every effort to engage with the customer to explain the process and the consequences of potential disqualification.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Scheme trustees have duties and responsibilities under trust law, under other relevant legislation and under the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.  It is important to note that pension scheme trustees have no function in negotiating improved benefits and entitlements for members under a pension scheme.  Consequently any decisions made by corporate or individual trustees of an occupational pension scheme are governed by the relevant legislation.  The provisions of the Pensions Act are enforced through the supervision of the Pensions Authority.  The Pensions Authority makes information available on its website to assist members, employers and trustees understand the procedures for member participation in the selection of trustees. </p>  <p>  If the funding of a pension scheme is not sufficient to satisfy the Funding Standard, the trustees may apply to the Pensions Authority for a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act 1990.  Under such an order, accrued benefits relating to members&rsquo; past service can be reduced.  Prior to making an application to the Pensions Authority, trustees must have undertaken a comprehensive review of the scheme with a view to the long term stability and sustainability of the scheme.  Before making an application for a section 50 direction, the trustees must notify in writing, all members of the scheme and any other person in receipt of benefits under the scheme, and also notify any authorised trade union representing members, or any representative group that meets certain requirements, of the proposed reductions.  This notification must include the circumstances of the Section 50 application, and the proposed reductions, including general illustrations of their effect.  It is important to note that all pension scheme members, not just pensioners, have one month to make written observations to trustees on proposed section 50 applications to the Pensions Authority.  Trustees must consider these observations before making an application to the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  The provisions in section 50 of the Pensions Act have been reviewed on a number of occasions in recent years.  Changes to this section of the Act were made in 2009 and again in 2013.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme when considering a restructure of scheme benefits.  These changes were designed to spread the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members and beneficiaries in any consideration of an application by the trustees of the scheme to restructure scheme benefits.  It is a matter for the trustees of a scheme, who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme members, to determine how the provisions in section 50 of the Act might be applied. </p>  <p>  Officials of my Department and I have met with association concerned and have explained how it is a legal requirement under the Pensions Act 1990, as amended, that trustees must act in the best interests of all scheme members whether active, deferred, or retired.  We have also explained that if any individual has evidence that pension scheme trustees are not acting in the best interests of all members they should complain to the scheme trustees in the first instance.  If the complainant is not satisfied with the trustees&rsquo; reply they should raise their concerns with the Pensions Authority.  </p>  <p>  I believe that current legislation allows for the best interests of all pension scheme members to be taken into account by pension scheme trustees.  Therefore I currently have no plans to amend the Pensions Act in this regard.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In summary, any income, with some exceptions, belonging to the person is assessable as means for DA purposes. </p>  <p>  Another condition for receipt of DA is that a person has an injury, disease or physical or mental disability that has continued (or may be expected to continue for at least one year) and that as a result of this disability, is substantially restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of his/her age, experience and qualifications.  </p>  <p>  The DA scheme is structured to encourage recipients to avail of opportunities to engage in rehabilitative work where this is appropriate, either in self-employment or in insurable employment. When an individual engages in rehabilitative work, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;120 per week, and 50% of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are also disregarded, for the purpose of the means test. </p>  <p>  Where the DA recipient commences self-employment, we require them to indicate when they are starting and the type of work involved.  We also request that they keep full records of their income and expenses from the date on which the self-employment commences.  This is to ensure that the appropriate evidence is available to a deciding officer to calculate the average earnings over the period most appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of each case. </p>  <p>  Approval must first be sought from my Department in order for the work to be considered as rehabilitative.  The term &lsquo;rehabilitative&rsquo; is not defined in legislation and is broadly interpreted in administrative practice as including appropriate work that would be regarded as good for the person and would be expected to result in more positive outcomes in symptom levels, self-esteem, quality of life and social functioning.  In all cases the recipient must forward a letter from their own doctor indicating that the work is rehabilitative. </p>  <p>  The Make Work Pay (MWP) report for people with disabilities, published in 2017, made a number of recommendations  including that the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative nature&rsquo; for the DA earnings disregard should be dispensed with.  This would mean that a report from a doctor would no longer required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity.  Legislation is required to give effect to this change and is included in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The Act transposes the EU Working Time Directive &ndash; Directive 2003/88/EC. The purpose of the Directive is to establish minimum health and safety requirements for the organisation of working time for employees.  The Directive provides for limited derogations from some of its provisions in certain circumstances.  These derogations were, for the most part, transposed into national legislation via the OWTA. </p>  <p>  Representations have been made to me from the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association, Horse Racing Ireland and from my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The representations raised the issue of the applicability of the Working Time Directive and the Act to the horse racing sector and in particular the derogations that may apply.   </p>  <p>  While the Directive sets down limits on the time that workers can work without rest breaks, it does allow some limited derogations from some of its provisions under certain circumstances. However, the Directive requires that the derogations in question are conditional on the employee receiving &lsquo;equivalent compensatory rest&rsquo;.  This means that the employee&rsquo;s statutory rest breaks may be postponed to a later time but they must be given to the employee as soon as possible thereafter and within a reasonable period of time. </p>  <p>  The Labour Court, in a determination earlier this year, found in one particular case that an employer in the horse racing industry was not entitled to avail of certain derogations from the working time legislation.  I am aware of the concern that exists in the horse racing industry arising from the Labour Court ruling.  I appreciate that the working time rules present particular challenges for the industry.  However, as Minister with responsibility for employments rights policy, I am equally conscious of the need to protect the health and safety of employees.  </p>  <p>  In response to the representations made to me, I obtained the legal advice of the Attorney General as to what options, if any, might be available to me to clarify the derogations available under the Directive in relation to the horse racing sector.  I have also met with representatives of employers in the sector as well as representatives of employees and heard their views on the particular characteristics of the industry in the context of the working time legislation.  My officials have met with officials of the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine and they are continuing to engage with them on the issue. </p>  <p>  I am currently considering the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice and the views of the various parties involved in this sensitive and complex matter.  My aim is to ensure that employers have the flexibilities they need to run successful and employment-rich businesses, within the derogations permitted by the Directive as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union, and that the employees have quality jobs where their employment rights are fully protected.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that an appeal against the Labour Court ruling is pending before the Circuit Court.  I am very conscious of the need to avoid taking any action that might be seen to interfere in the judicial domain. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further.</p></reply>

This will be undertaken using person-centred, case management approaches that support participants to identify and follow progression pathways based on both their needs and their potential.  The programme is being managed by Pobal on behalf of the Department, and it will be delivered by national, regional or local organisations from around the country that have experience of working with people with a disability. </p><p>Along with my colleague, Minister McGrath, I was happy to announce the Ability programme funding on 1 June.  The programme seeks to support young people with disabilities, who are able to, and want to work, to navigate their individual transition period into employment and I welcome the roll out of the services to be provided by the various organisations over the next three years. </p><p>Ability will be funded under the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) operational programme, 2014-2020 (PEIL, 2014 &ndash; 20) and the Irish Exchequer. There has been a significant level of interest in the Ability programme, with 59 applications received. Initially it was expected that funding for the programme would amount to some &euro;10 million over a three year period.  However, given the quality of the proposals received, enhanced funding has been put in place of around &euro;16 million to support all 27 projects based on the funding level recommended by Pobal.

In summary, any income, with some exceptions, belonging to the person is assessable as means for DA purposes. </p>  <p>  Another condition for receipt of DA is that a person has an injury, disease or physical or mental disability that has continued (or may be expected to continue for at least one year) and that as a result of this disability, is substantially restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of his/her age, experience and qualifications.  </p>  <p>  The DA scheme is structured to encourage recipients to avail of opportunities to engage in rehabilitative work where this is appropriate, either in self-employment or in insurable employment. When an individual engages in rehabilitative work, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;120 per week, and 50% of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are also disregarded, for the purpose of the means test. </p>  <p>  Where the DA recipient commences self-employment, we require them to indicate when they are starting and the type of work involved. We also request that they keep full records of their income and expenses from the date on which the self-employment commences. This is to ensure that the appropriate evidence is available to a deciding officer to calculate the average earnings over the period most appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of each case. </p>  <p>  Approval must first be sought from my Department in order for the work to be considered as rehabilitative. The term &lsquo;rehabilitative&rsquo; is not defined in legislation and is broadly interpreted in administrative practice as including appropriate work that would be regarded as good for the person and would be expected to result in more positive outcomes in symptom levels, self-esteem, quality of life and social functioning.  In all cases the recipient must forward a letter from their own doctor indicating that the work is rehabilitative. </p>  <p>  The Make Work Pay (MWP) report for people with disabilities, published in 2017, made a number of recommendations  including that the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative nature&rsquo; for the DA earnings disregard should be dispensed with. This would mean that a report from a doctor would no longer required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity. Legislation is required to give effect to this change and is included in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

DCA is payable from the month following receipt of the application unless good cause is shown for the delay in submitting the claim, in which case backdating to a maximum of 6 months can be considered. When dealing with the application the deciding officer was not satisfied that the person concerned had indicated a good reason for the delay in claiming the payment and, as a result, the allowance was put into payment from 1st March 2011, the month after the application was received in the Department. The person concerned was given the right of appeal, if not satisfied with the decision, no appeal was lodged. </p><p>The person concerned subsequently requested a review of the decision on the 28<sup>th</sup>February 2018, seeking to have the award of DCA backdated to the date of birth.

Youth unemployment figures can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment.  </p><p>In early 2018, youth unemployment is already below the 12% target level set in Pathways to Work for 2020.  Additionally, Eurostat figures indicate that the number of young people in full-time employment has grown from 197,000 in mid-2012 to 238,000 by Q.4 2017.</p><p>These trends indicate that together with improvements in the labour market and economic recovery, our approach to youth employment, which focuses in the first instance on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to find and secure sustainable jobs, has been relatively successful.  </p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities. </p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under-25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.</p><p>The strategy document<i>Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020</i>includes some additional actions in relation to addressing youth unemployment: </p><p>1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed;  </p><p>2) ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month;  </p><p>3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers </p><p>4) implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme.  </p><p>Each of these actions is either ongoing or has been completed.</p><p>I will shortly be introducing a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment. The new Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement. Operational details are currently being finalised.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current  policy approach  will continue to address youth unemployment and support further improvements in the labour market situation for young people.</p></reply>

Of these, some 28.18 million households (16.5% of the total) were jobless - that is, no adult in the household was working.</p>  <p>  For Ireland, the total number of relevant households was 1,489,600, and of these some 234,100 (15.7% of the total) were jobless.</p>  <p>  Although the figure for Ireland has fallen from a high of 23% in 2012 (when it was significantly above the EU average of 19%) as a result of the economic recovery, government remains concerned about aspects of household joblessness that go beyond the standard measures of unemployment and receipt of jobseekers&rsquo; payments.  Relevant groups, not normally considered to be unemployed, include economically inactive lone parents, people with disabilities, and the adult dependants of unemployed people, all of whom might benefit from closer attachment to employment and the labour market.  A range of policy reforms has been taken affecting these groups, and further reforms are being considered in consultation with representative bodies for those involved.  These policy developments were set out in an Action Plan for Jobless Households, which was published by my department in September 2017.</p></reply>

Ireland is required to produce river basin management plans under the Water Framework Directive. </p><p>During the development of this Plan, a prioritisation exercise was undertaken by the local authorities, the EPA and other stakeholders to identify those water bodies that require immediate action within this plan cycle to 2021. During this catchment characterisation, the EPA identified those water bodies adjudged to be either at risk of not achieving their objectives, or under review.</p><p>Led jointly by the EPA and the Local Authority Waters and Communities Office, a collaborative workshop process involving senior local authority personnel and all relevant stakeholders was set up to identify, at a regional level, those water bodies that should be prioritised for action during this planning cycle. This process was based on the priorities outlined in the Plan, on the evidence from the characterisation process and on the data and knowledge of public authority personnel. The outcome of this prioritisation process was the selection of 190 areas for action across our River Basin District. Within these 190 areas, a total of 726 water bodies were selected for initial actions during this RBMP cycle. </p><p>The actions involve multidisciplinary and cross-agency approaches. One such action is the creation of an Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme. The Programme involves the provision of 30 new sustainability advisors who will work collaboratively with farmers in prioritised areas for action, providing advice and support which will enable them to contribute to the protection and enhancement of water quality. </p><p>Details of the 190 areas for action are set out in Appendix 2 of the River Basin Management Plan, and are also available on the catchments website at: . </p></reply>

The Policy Statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation, and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans. The Policy Statement is available on my Department's website at the following link: http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/water_services_policy_statement_2018-2025_0.pdf.  </p><p>The Policy Statement supports the promotion of water conservation and water resource management as an important element of water services policy that is to be reflected in strategic investment planning by Irish Water. For the period of the Policy Statement, this will involve the prioritisation of multifaceted programmes around leak detection and repair, network improvements, cost effective metering, public awareness campaigns and funding to fix customer side leaks.</p><p>This policy statement was informed by the 2017 Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services which was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and which includes a number of recommendations in relation to the continued use of metering to support water conservation, to reduce leakages and to ensure compliance with the European Union Water Framework Directive, as opposed to for revenue raising purposes.  The Water Services Policy Statement is consistent with this position.</p><p>Within 3 months of publication of the Water Services Policy Statement, Irish Water must prepare a Strategic Funding Plan setting out its proposals for operational and capital expenditure on all aspects of the development and delivery of public water services, including conservation and water resource management.  Once finalised and approved by me as Minister, the Strategic Funding Plan will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will inform Irish Water&rsquo;s submissions to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities which will consider the efficiency of investment proposals. Ultimately this will feed into annual Exchequer decisions on spending.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters.  The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>  <p>  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces. Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.</p>  <p>  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV has not changed significantly in recent years.  The national average ARV decreased slightly each year from 2010 to 2015 and has increased slightly each year from 2016 to 2018.  </p>  <p>  As provided for under section 66 of the Local Government Act 2001, local authorities may decide to offer assistance or money in kind in order to promote the interests of the local community, which includes, inter alia, the economic or general development of the administrative area (or part of it) of the local authority concerned.  Also, local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulty in the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options that reflect capacity to pay. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates, and last year the Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill.  Among the measures included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support the implementation of policy objectives, including: local economic and community plans; objectives contained in Development Plans and Local Area Plans; and national planning policies.  The Bill is currently with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for drafting, with a view to its introduction as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Examples of such infrastructure and facilities include roads, footpaths, public lighting, open spaces etc. My role as Minister is to provide the necessary legislative and policy framework governing development contribution schemes which are operated by planning authorities.   </p>  <p>  The basis for the determination of a development contribution is set out in a development contribution scheme adopted by the elected members of a local authority, and planning authorities may make one or more schemes in respect of different parts of its functional area.  In addition to the terms of the scheme, planning authorities may require the payment of a special contribution in respect of a particular development where specific exceptional costs not covered by a scheme are incurred by any local authority in respect of public infrastructure and facilities which benefit the proposed development.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority, and it is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply, and the expenditure of the contributions received within the confines of the scheme conditions.</p>  <p>  Separately, section 34(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that planning authorities may attach conditions to a grant of planning permission.  Section 34(4) lists specific conditions that may be attached, but this is expressly without prejudice to the generality of the power to attach conditions set out in subsection (1).  </p>  <p>  The interpretation and application of the relevant legislation is a matter for planning authorities in the first instance, An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, and ultimately the Courts. The decision as to whether to grant a planning application, with or without conditions, is a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la as appropriate and I have no role in relation to the matter. Any decision to attach a condition to a grant of permission requiring a contribution for the repair of any damage to the roads caused by such construction is similarly a matter for the relevant planning authority.</p></reply>

To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally. These mapped sites can be viewed at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>In addition to this mapping exercise, all local authorities, have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for housing lands in their ownership, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.</p><p>From a longer-term strategic perspective, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government announced its intention to establish a new National Regeneration and Development Agency, which will have a role in managing the State's wider publicly-owned land bank to ensure that overall development needs, including housing, are met. The new Agency will work closely with local authorities, Government Departments, Agencies and other State and semi-State bodies to secure the best use of public lands and ensure the delivery on the objectives of the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan.</p><p>In respect of the number of local authority houses under construction, this is set out in the Social Housing Construction Status Report which is published on a quarterly basis. The report covering the period up to end Quarter 4 2017 was published on 19 April 2018 and is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: .  The report provides project details of the social housing construction pipeline in place at end-2017 for all local authorities, including those being delivered in partnership with approved housing bodies.</p><p>The report shows a pipeline of over 13,400 social homes, a substantial increase on the 8,430 homes in the pipeline a year earlier. At end 2017, almost 2,600 social homes were completed, with another 3,650 homes under construction, 1,900 homes about to go on site and the remaining 5,300 homes progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement.</p></reply>

The function of the Service is to work with homeless households to identify potential rental properities and support them to secure the tenancies. The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 3,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme. A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017.</p>  <p>  In order to further assist homeless households to exit emergency accommodation, since January 2018, the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service can now be made available in each of the 31 local authority areas.  I have provided sanction to local authorities to recruit the necessary personnel required to operate an apporpriate Place Finder Service in their areas. To date 14 local authorities have expressed an interest in making this support available to homeless households. I also provided local authorities with the capacity to pay deposits and advance rental payments on behalf households in emergency homeless accommodation or who are at immediate risk of entering emergency accommodation in order to secure accommodation via the HAP scheme. To qualify for these specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988. The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service, is a matter for each local authority. </p>  <p>  Aside from the specific Place Finder supports available to homeless households who could benefit from HAP, every local authority has discretion to exercise flexibility and agree to a HAP payment, up to 20% (up to 50% in the Dublin local authority areas only) above the maximum rent limit for that household type where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions. </p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities. However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century. Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  My Department is developing proposals for a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  In this regard, the Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill in April 2017.  It is currently with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting, with a view to its introduction as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Debt Management Project Implementation Board, on which my Department and the Local Authority Sector were represented, was established by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in February 2015, to progress the recommendations of the Debt Management Review, which was published in 2014.   As part of this process, the local authorities undertook a range of work to improve collection levels including;</p>  <p>  - Setting targets for reduction of arrears of commercial rates in each local authority;</p>  <p>  - Improved reporting of rates debts in local authority financial statements;</p>  <p>  - Introduction of strengthened policies relating to debt collection; and</p>  <p>  - The development and rollout of a training and education programme.</p>  <p>  As part of this process, the local authority sector prepared a business case for stronger enforcement powers in the collection of commercial rates.  This business case was endorsed by the Project Board.  Provision for strengthened enforcement powers for local authorities is included in the Rates Bill currently being drafted.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;115.7 million has been provided from 2013 to the end of 2017 to improve almost 64,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020. </p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the Programme focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation and is expected to be completed this year. Phase 2 will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction and has been successfully piloted by Westmeath and Fingal County Councils. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently contacted all local authorities seeking details of their work proposals under both phases of the Programme in 2018. Following analysis of these proposals, funding allocations will be issued to local authorities and Phase 2 will be rolled out nationally. As Phase 2 attracts co-funding at a rate of 50% under the European Regional Development Fund 2014 &ndash; 2020 it must be implemented in accordance with all relevant EU regulations and the management and control procedures, including procurement, as required by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area (LEA) within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,054 per month in Q4 2017).</p><p>As the average rent in both of the Dundalk LEAs, as set out in the Table below, is currently below the national average rent, they do not qualify for consideration to be designated as a RPZ.  However, the Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.

Pursuant to section 3(1) of the 2004 Act, the Acts apply to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy. The provisions of the Acts, including those provisions providing for the rent pressure zone measure, do not apply where the dwelling is occupied by a person under an agreement which is not a tenancy agreement.  </p><p>Licensing agreements, such as those that apply in respect of some types of student accommodation, are not covered by the legislative protections of the Residential Tenancies Acts because they are not deemed to be tenancy agreements for the purposes of the Acts.  Consequently, the restrictions on rental increases in Rent Pressure Zones, provided for in the Acts, do not apply to accommodation types that are not subject to a tenancy agreement.</p><p>However, if there is any doubt as to the type of agreement in place in respect of individual dwellings, for example whether it is a tenancy or licence, the matter should be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for a determination.  </p><p>In addition, the Department of Education and Skills (DES) is liaising with my Department, including through the forum of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Student Accommodation which is convened by the DES, to examine the wide range of student accommodation types (and ancillary services) available with a view to considering how best to regulate the associated pricing arrangements.</p></reply>

The slowdown in the quarterly growth rate in Dublin rents to 1.1% in Q4 2017 is particularly noteworthy, bringing the annualised growth rate over 2017 to 5.2%, a drop from 8% in the year to Q3 2017.  Significantly, this 5.2% increase for Dublin is the lowest annual growth rate since 2013.

Preliminary approval was given to 34 projects in March 2017 and I have since fully approved funding for 30 of those projects, including roads, bridges and parks, at a cost of approximately &euro;195 million, with an associated housing delivery of 20,000 housing units by 2021.</p><p>All projects that received preliminary approval in March 2017 were allowed to proceed to design phase immediately after that and most are going through the planning and tendering phases at the moment, with one at construction stage.</p><p>Local authorities can draw down the funding allocated to their projects at any stage, once the project cost has been incurred. My Department invited the 14 local authorities involved to submit their first tranche of certified expenditure at the end of 2017 and the total submitted by local authorities for draw down was &euro;1.6 million. </p><p>While there was an underspend by local authorities in 2017, funding for LIHAF is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and through proactive management of the broader housing programme, any LIHAF underspend in 2017 was diverted to other housing activities, ensuring that the funding available in 2017 was fully applied to housing priorities.</p><p>The low level of the draw-down to date by local authorities reflects the stages which these infrastructure projects are at currently. The expenditure incurred during the design, planning and tendering stages is significantly lower than that at the construction stage so a major increase in drawdown is expected as projects progress through to construction.</p><p>While I am anxious for the infrastructure and the housing to be delivered as fast as possible, I recognise that local authorities must observe proper design, planning and tendering procedures. My Department will continue to monitor progress on these sites and ensure that every effort is made to secure the timely delivery of the infrastructure involved.</p><p>While LIHAF is designed primarily as a housing supply activation measure, as part of the terms of the fund, local authorities were asked to leverage the funding to ensure that housing activated by LIHAF would be made more affordable. Following final approval of projects, details of the projected delivery under LIHAF for all 30 projects were updated and are available at . Some of the housing will be delivered in tandem with the infrastructure, with other sites needing the infrastructure to be in place before housing can be delivered. As the projects move forward over 2018 to 2021, my Department will be in a position to update on delivery of housing, including the provision of reduced-cost and affordable homes on these sites.  </p></reply>

In that context, the focus is on meeting the housing needs of those in the lower-income categories, particularly those in need of social housing supports and other households that are most challenged from an affordability perspective, such as first-time buyers.  The significant progress being made in these areas is outlined on the Rebuilding Ireland website at <i>.</i></p><p>In Budget 2018, the social housing allocation was increased to over &euro;6 billion for the lifespan of Rebuilding Ireland, with a target of 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered by 2021, and some 87,000 households to be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.  In 2017, almost 26,000 households had their social housing need met, significantly ahead of the target set.  </p><p>In May 2018, I wrote to all local authorities, including Laois County Council, setting out their individual social housing targets across build, acquisition and leasing for 2018 and also for 2018-2021. Details of these are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:<i></i>. </p><p>In respect of social housing build targets for 2018, a strong pipeline is already in place for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to deliver on these targets. The 2018 build target is for the delivery of 4,969 additional social housing homes, including 3,819 local authority and AHB build units. The Quarter 4 2017 Construction Status Report, which is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link, , provides details of projects on a local authority by authority basis. </p><p>I announced new housing affordability measures in January of this year. These target both affordable purchase and rental units to be delivered initially from local authority housing land-banks, with the potential to deliver more than 3,000 new affordable homes to buy or rent initially, with a target delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes in the medium to longer term.</p><p>Delivery of affordable homes will require local authorities to maximise the potential delivery of new homes from their land bank. This may include mixed-tenure developments on appropriate sites and my Department will continue to work with Laois County Council and all local authorities with regard to any social and mixed-tenure housing proposals that they bring forward, in order to maximise delivery and also harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units in 2018.</p></reply>

Final approval was given for 30 projects under LIHAF in 2017 and these projects will stimulate development of approximately 20,000 housing units across 14 local authorities.</p><p>Activation of housing development at scale is a priority under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland, but so too is the delivery of more affordable homes and I note the particular challenges in the cities of Dublin and Cork where people are facing the greatest affordability challenges. </p><p>Earlier this year, I announced a package of initiatives to help alleviate affordability pressures faced by households, particularly in those areas of high housing demand and high accommodation costs. The measures announced include the establishment of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the re-introduction of an affordable purchase scheme, and the introduction of cost rental projects.  Further details on the suite of initiatives can be found at . </p><p>Importantly, the new affordability measures are specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes from the State's land bank. In this regard, and to aid local authorities further in delivering affordable housing from their sites, as part of Budget 2018, the Government announced the establishment of a new Serviced Sites Fund to unlock local authority-owned lands specifically to deliver affordable homes. The funding will support local authorities to provide enabling infrastructure on sites which they own, particularly in urban areas facing the greatest affordability challenge. I intend to issue a call for proposals under the Fund in the near future. </p><p>Within this cross-cutting policy context, I am also reviewing the plans for a second call under LIHAF, in light of the new measures referenced above, the importance of synergy with the Serviced Sites Fund, and the imminent calls for proposals under the new &euro;2bn Urban Regeneration and Development Fund and the &euro;1bn Rural Regeneration and Development Fund under Project Ireland 2040 and the 10-year National Development Plan.  These funds are aimed at enabling residential and commercial development, supported by infrastructure, services and amenities, within the existing built-up areas of all of our urban settlements as well as transforming our rural towns and villages and their outlying areas, to ensure that they are viable and attractive places in which to live, work, invest and visit. </p><p>I expect to make a decision regarding a second call under LIHAF shortly.</p></reply>

Critically, &euro;6 billion in exchequer investment is now available for the delivery of 50,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021.</p><p>This funding is available to all local authorities to advance their social housing construction programmes, including projects detailed in appendix 2 of the Laying the Foundations report. Substantial additional construction projects have been added to the social housing delivery programme since then and with a view to greater transparency in this area, I publish, on a quarterly basis, a comprehensive status report of all the social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas. These reports show details such as the project locations and a range of information relating to their advancement, whether completed or on site or progressing through planning, design and construction and it includes projects approved in 2015 and 2016 and listed in appendix 2 of the Laying the Foundations report. </p><p>The most recent of these quarterly reports was published on 19 April 2018.  It covers the period up to end Quarter 4 2017 and is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: .</p><p>The report shows a pipeline of over 13,400 social homes, a very substantial increase on the 8,430 homes in the pipeline a year earlier. At end-2017, almost 2,600 social homes were completed, with another 3,650 homes under construction, 1,900 homes about to go on site and the remaining 5,300 homes progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement.</p><p>The report covering the period to the end of Quarter 1 of 2018 is currently being compiled and will be published in the coming weeks.  Further social housing project approvals are being added to the construction programme as they are developed by local authorities and approved housing bodies. I am keen that all local authorities advance their social housing projects as speedily as possible and I have assured them that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p></reply>

I made a similar visit to Mayo on 26 January 2018. </p><p>Once the public consultation process has been finalised and the standardised protocol is in place, I will be in a position to provide a further update on progress at that time.</p><p>In addition, I am currently considering what further actions may be required to assist the parties directly involved in reaching a satisfactory resolution to the problems that have emerged in the two counties. </p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (i.e. &euro;1,054 per month in Q4 2017).</p><p>On 21 March 2018, the RTB published its Rent Index Report in relation to Quarter 4 2017, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country. This allows everyone to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  </p><p>Rent reviews outside of Rent Pressure Zones are restricted so that a landlord can only review the rent once in any two-year period. However, similar to within Rent Pressure Zones, where there is a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation provided, for example through a major refurbishment of the property, a landlord may review the rent before the two-year period has ended and therefore many of the principles in determining what is classified as substantial change are the same. The existing requirement that the rent set is not above the market rents for similar properties still applies in designated Rent Pressure Zones and in non-designated areas.</p><p>The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

Security of tenure provisions under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 apply once a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months, with no valid notice of termination having been served during that time. Section 34 provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in accordance with the grounds for termination set out the Table to section 34 of the Act.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. While it is not clear what type of tenancy is involved in the situation outlined, the RTB replaces the Courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes which come under the remit of Residential Tenancies Acts. Section 56 of the 2004 Act provides that, where there is an abuse of the termination procedure in section 34, a tenant may bring a complaint to the RTB on the basis that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of a dwelling by their landlord. Further information from the RTB is available at and through the RTB helpline - Lo-call on 0818 30 30 37. </p><p>In April this year, the Government approved the General Scheme of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 as a basis for priority drafting of an urgent Bill to give legislative underpinning to a number of specific actions outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for the Rental Sector and the review of Rebuilding Ireland.  The main purpose of the Bill is to reinforce the operation of the rental sector, through addressing a number of key tenant protection issues, provide greater transparency around rents, as well as enhancing and strengthening the powers and functions of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), particularly in enforcing tenancy law.</p></reply>

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017.  Planning authorities have issued notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June this year in respect of vacant sites included on their respective registers on 1 January 2018, indicating that the levy will apply to those sites on 1 January 2019.  </p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area.

Of these, just under 190 sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully used, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas and so that the full potential of the measure can be realised.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / cohabitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p><p>The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>In line with the commitment given in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p><p>The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. In finalising the report some further consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements.

The availability of the bible is simply a measure of administrative efficiency to facilitate the process of taking an oath.  An elector may make an affirmation if they object to taking an oath on the ground that he or she has no religious belief or that the taking of an oath is contrary to his or her religious belief. </p></reply>

Where such a dwelling becomes vacant, the terms of the P&amp;amp;A agreements provide that payments continue to be made to the AHB for a maximum period of 3 consecutive months in order to allow for re-tenanting of the dwelling. For CALF properties, this period can be extended by one additional month where the housing authority has not provided a nomination within one month of being notified of the vacancy. </p><p>If the dwelling remains vacant at the end of the 3-month period and has not been withdrawn from the scheme, it is deemed to be inactive and notified to my Department. No payment is made by my Department in respect of inactive dwellings. Inactive dwellings may become active again when they are re-tenanted. </p><p>In relation to the AHBs referred to in the questions, I understand that there are currently no inactive properties in the SHCEP programme. However, my Department does not hold data on properties within SHCEP that have been vacant for less than 3 months.</p><p>AHBs may also avail of funding of up to 100% under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme to assist them in providing housing for the elderly, homeless and people with disabilities.

Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision. </p><p>During the period January to April 2018, the Board received 713 normal planning appeals and disposed of 635 cases, 222 of which were disposed of within the statutory objective period, resulting in a compliance rate of 35%. <b></b>This overall reduction in the compliance rate can be attributed to a number of factors.  </p><p>Firstly, there was a reduction in Board capacity in mid-2017, arising from a time interval between the departure of five outgoing Board members, whose terms of office had expired in April and May, and the five new replacement Board members taking up their posts.  While by September 2017, the Board complement had been fully replenished, this time interval significantly impacted on the Board&rsquo;s case work output for some time thereafter. </p><p>In addition, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also implementing a major ICT strategy which will facilitate the introduction of on-line planning services as part of a complete upgrade and replacement of core systems.  In this regard, a new case management system was installed and became operational in Q4 2017.  As is to be expected with such a fundamental and integrated project, the transition to the new system has caused some initial disruption to the processing of cases, resulting in a further increase in the backlog of cases on hand. However, measures have been put in place to ensure that the new system is bedded down and becomes operational at an optimal level as soon as possible. </p><p>Furthermore, during this period, there has been a general increase in cases received by the Board.  For example, there was an increase of almost 12% on normal planning appeals received in 2017 compared to 2016; this upward trend has continued into 2018. The intake of normal planning appeals at end-April 2018 was 17% greater than the intake at end-April 2017.  As mentioned above, during the period January to April 2018, the Board disposed of 635 appeal cases, compared to 601 cases during the same period in 2017.</p><p>Now that the Board's full complement has been restored, combined with the measures that are being put in place in relation to the new ICT systems, it is expected that the backlog of cases will begin to reduce over the coming months, with an associated improvement in the compliance rate with the statutory objective period for the determination of cases.</p><p>It should be noted that, in line with Government policy in relation to the provision of housing supply, all planning appeals in respect of housing developments of 30 units or more are prioritised by the Board for decision. The Board also prioritises developments which have a significant employment or economic potential on a national, regional or local scale as well as new, and extensions to, school buildings and educational facilities.</p><p>In relation to priority cases being dealt with by the Board, since July 2017, the Board has been determining planning applications for strategic housing developments (SHDs) made directly to it within the 16-week timeframe prescribed for such planning applications under the provisions of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  At end-April 2018, 24 SHD planning applications had been made, with the Board issuing decisions in 16 cases, all of which were made within the prescribed 16-week timeframe.</p><p>My Department liaises closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources in relation to the performance of its functions.  With regard to the additional functions in relation to SHDs recently assigned to the Board, a new Strategic Housing Division of the Board has been established to decide on these applications, involving the recruitment of an additional dedicated 10 professional and administrative staff members in 2017.  Two additional Boards members have also been sanctioned to serve this Division, with the appointments being made in February and June this year.  The Board now has a complement of 11 members and there are over 150 staff members employed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am satisfied that the Board has sufficient and necessary resources in this regard.</p></reply>

It is estimated that the revised subsidy levels will cost approximately &euro;23.3 million per year compared with an average annual cost of &euro;19.5 million for past comparable years.  </p><p>This increase in the level of subsidies to Group Water Schemes was the first of a number of actions I am taking to address the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there is equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services. </p><p>At that time I also signalled my intention to establish a Working Group to conduct a wider review of investment needs and rural water services.  The Working Group was established in April 2018 and its inaugural meeting took place on 17 May.</p><p>The Group's review is considering how best to position and resource water services in rural areas so that they can contribute further to the development and long-term sustainability of a comprehensive and cohesive Rural Water Sector that will have the capacity to produce quality outcomes comparable to those available to customers of public water services.  The Working Group is focusing on the actions required to improve and sustain rural water services, and will consider issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, in addition to capital investment priorities and requirements across all elements of rural water services.  In keeping with the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s recommendation this Working Group will consider the investment needs of all elements of rural water services including<i></i>Group Water Schemes, Group Sewerage Schemes and Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems.  The Working Group is specifically tasked with addressing grant support for Individual Domestic Water Supplies (private wells) to encourage the refurbishment of wells to improve the quality of drinking water in private supplies.</p><p>Considering the importance and scale of this task it is considered important that the Working Group would have access to accurate recent comprehensive information on all aspects of the Rural Water Sector.  Therefore to support the business of the Working Group an exercise is being initiated to gather information on the capacity of the Rural Water Sector and to establish the interventions including the levels of capital investment and the levels of funding that will be required to sustain the Sector.</p></reply>

No 440 of 2003).  My Department has a statutory role to ensure all premises identified as zoos in Ireland are inspected and licensed, if appropriate, each year.</p>  <p>  The Irish Standards of Modern Zoo Practice (ISMZP), published by my Department in 2016, support the legislation and provide clarity to zoos on what is expected of them in order to be in compliance with the existing legislative and policy framework.  Any premises that exhibits to the public animals of wild species for more than 7 days a year is classed as a zoo for the purpose of the legislation.</p>  <p>  At present, 83 establishments that meet this definition of a zoo have been identified in the State.  61 have either licences or exemptions and the remaining establishments will be licensed or exempted this year.  My Department has not received an application for an exemption from the facility referred to in the question.</p>  <p>  As a licensed zoo, the facility was scheduled to be inspected on the 14th June 2018.  However, the owners contacted my Department on the 29th May, stating that they would no longer open to the public and requesting that the inspection be cancelled.  Officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service are in contact with the owners on this matter.</p>  <p>  I would stress that my Department does not necessarily expect that all zoos will meet all the required standards on the first inspection.  The zoo inspectorate works closely with zoos on an achievable and agreed plan to bring them up to the standard required and ensure the best possible conditions for animal populations and also to ensure that wider biodiversity and conservation objectives are realized.  My Department plays an important role in monitoring zoos and setting policy and guidelines that help raise standards across the sector, benefitting the animal populations in the zoos and ensuring health and safety standards are maintained for all staff and visitors.</p></reply>

The Departments of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; Communications, Climate Action and Environment; and Business, Enterprise and Innovation and their agencies are key partners in this Action Plan.</p><p>The Audiovisual Action Plan is being produced out of a number of key inputs including:</p><p>a.

The fundamental objective has been to protect and preserve the toghers and I am satisfied that the measures being taken represent the best approach to securing an optimal outcome in that regard.</p>  <p>  The provision of visitor facilities by the State at archaeological monument sites is a function of the Office of Public Works (OPW) rather than of my own Department.  Such facilities are put in place by OPW at the more significant locations that are in my ownership or guardianship, as Minister, under the National Monuments Acts. The Mayne togher site is not in state care and is privately owned. I am advised that the Glendalough and Ballycroy facilities instanced by the Deputy, which are managed by OPW and my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service respectively, both involve substantial capital investments with significant ongoing running costs.</p>  <p>  I fully appreciate the local and wider public interest there is in the Mayne toghers and it may be that the local authority, assisted perhaps by local groups, might be interested in helping with the presentation of the site.  I am happy to confirm that my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service will be available to assist and guide the Council in that regard if required.</p></reply>

This is an increase of &euro;123,000 on the 2017 allocation, which, in turn, had been increased by over &euro;1 million on the 2016 allocation. </p><p>The Heritage in Schools Programme is very popular and successful in raising awareness and appreciation of our national heritage. </p><p>I am informed by the Heritage Council that the amount allocated for Heritage in Schools increased from &euro;255,000 in 2016 to &euro;300,000 in 2017.  On the basis of information currently available, and depending on uptake of planned bookings in the course of the year, the Council expects to spend over &euro;315,000 on the scheme in 2018. That's an increase of almost 24% in two years.</p><p>It is a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding is allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.</p><p>I understand that Heritage in Schools is fully booked for this year.  I also understand, however, that the Heritage Council is examining whether it can identify further funding to allow the Programme to expand and meet increased demand. The Heritage Council plans to develop the Programme further as part of its new Strategic Plan which will be published shortly. </p><p>In relation to the costs of oversight of the programme, I am informed that there has been no increase in 2018 compared to 2017. Changes were made to the programme in 2017, arising from the recommendations of an independent review of the scheme commissioned by the Heritage Council and completed in August 2016. These included the appointment of a project manager.</p><p>More detailed information on this Programme and the Heritage Council&rsquo;s other activities is available on its website or by contacting the Council directly.</p></reply>
