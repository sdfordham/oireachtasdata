In 2010, the then Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this Battlegroup. The other members of the Austro-German Battlegroup are Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).    Our contribution is a Reconnaissance Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force Headquarters.  Should the Battlegroup be deployed, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution would amount to approximately 175 personnel. During the stand-by period one officer has been deployed to the Battlegroup Headquarters in Ulm, Germany. This officer is engaged in training and planning activities.</p><p>  Under the Battlegroup Concept, Battlegroups are designed to be operational within 5-10 days of approval of an operation by the Council of the European Union.  Battlegroup operations must be sustainable for at least 30 days which can be extended to a maximum of 120 days.  </p><p>  Training of the manoeuvre elements of the Austro-German Battlegroup took place in the contributing Member States - Irish troops were trained in Ireland.  There were no joint field exercises or manoeuvre training with other elements in the Austro-German Battlegroup.  </p><p>  Any decision to deploy the Austro-German Battlegroup will continue to be taken by unanimity by the Council of the European Union. In addition, any decision by Ireland to participate in a specific Battlegroup operation is subject to our national sovereign decision-making procedures - &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo;, i.e. UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval. At this time, there are no proposals under consideration for the deployment of the Austro/German Battlegroup.</p></reply>

The planning certainty arising from the policy provisions of the current White Paper underpinned the modernisation process within the Defence Organisation. It also afforded the requisite flexibility to develop appropriate capabilities in response to changes in the defence and security environment.   Having considered the preliminary work undertaken on the preparation of a new White Paper on Defence, I decided to expand the planned consultative process by initiating the preparation of a Green Paper on Defence. In April 2012, a Memorandum for Government setting out the proposed approach and timeframe was approved by Government. The purpose of the Green Paper will be to elicit an informed debate regarding Ireland&rsquo;s defence policy.</p><p>  The process of preparing a Green Paper on Defence has commenced. Following Government approval for the process for the development of a new Green/White Paper on Defence, an interdepartmental group was convened to prepare a current assessment of the defence and security environment. The assessment will form the basis of the policy questions to be raised in the Green Paper. </p><p>  The Green Paper is expected to be published at the end of 2012. When published, the Green Paper will initiate and inform a broad consultative process as part of the development of a new White Paper on Defence. The views of members of the public and other interested parties on Defence policy and Defence provision will be welcomed. </p><p>  The new White Paper on Defence is scheduled for completion at the end of 2013 and will address Defence Policy and inform long term capability requirements.</p></reply>

This demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of international peace. This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.  with smaller contributions in Kosovo, Bosnia Herzegovina, Afghanistan and EUTM Somalia.</p><p>Ireland is also currently participating in the Austro-German led Battlegroup which is on stand-by from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012. Defence Forces personnel are currently serving in peacekeeping operations in 11 countries throughout the world.</p><p>The average monthly figures for Defence Forces personnel involved in UN-led and UN mandated missions for the years 2008 -2011 breaks down as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Average Number</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2008</b></td><td><b>660 personnel</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>2009</b></td><td><b>744 personnel </b></td></tr><tr><td><b>2010</b></td><td><b>412 personnel </b></td></tr><tr><td><b>2011</b></td><td><b>337 personnel</b></td></tr></table></p><p>The average monthly figure so far for 2012 is 477 personnel. This does not include the 175 personnel currently assigned to the EU Battlegroup.</p><p>As regards future deployment of Defence Forces overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.</p><p>Ireland has received an invitation from the Operational Commander of Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA to contribute an Autonomous Vessel Protection Detachment (AVPD) to the Operation. This operation is the EU&rsquo;s first maritime operation which contributes to improving maritime security off the coast of Somalia and in the Indian Ocean. The Defence organisation is currently considering whether it will be in a position to contribute an AVPD to this operation.</p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas. However, following the deployment of a Battalion to UNIFIL since mid-2011, it is not anticipated that there will be any major deployments of troops to further missions in the foreseeable future. However, the potential for deploying smaller groups of personnel and military observers in support of UN mandated operations will continue to be examined positively, as such requests arise.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-07a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110700061#WRB01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 31 together. </p><p>  The primary role of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which is provided for in the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004, is to provide an independent appeals process for members of the Defence Forces. Such appeals arise where a complaint has been processed through the internal Defence Forces &ldquo;Redress of Wrongs&rdquo; process but the member remains dissatisfied with the outcome or the manner in which the complaint was handled.</p><p>  The 2004 Act also provides that, subject to certain conditions, the Ombudsman may accept complaints directly from former members of the Defence Forces. </p><p>  The office of the Ombudsman is now well established and a number of administrative and systemic issues identified by the outgoing Ombudsman have been addressed. This has contributed to improvements in procedures and policies within the Defence Forces. </p><p>Recent trends show a significant increase in the number of redress of wrongs complaints being resolved within the military system, thus reducing the number of cases being referred to the Ombudsman for investigation, a fact I very much welcome.In addition, it is anticipated that the new and comprehensive promotion system for NCOs agreed and introduced earlier this year will eliminate the many complaint referrals to the Ombudsman relating to promotion. Such referrals currently account for about a third of the caseload in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office.Against this background, the post of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is being filled on a part time, three day week basis, subject to ongoing review of caseload and referrals.</p><p>  I can now inform the House that yesterday the Government decided, on foot of a recommendation from me, that it would advise the President to appoint Mr. Patrick Anthony McCourt as Ombudsman for the Defence Forces for a period of three years. The Warrant appointing Mr. McCourt to the post is currently with the President for signature. Mr. McCourt was recommended for the post by the Public Appointments Service following an open competition.</p><p>There are no plans currently for changes in the role of the Ombudsman or to amend the legislation in relation to the powers or functions of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-07a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110700061#WRB01500"><p>The depth and gravity of the current economic difficulties means that all areas of the public sector must deliver greater efficiencies and operate within a reduced resource envelope.    All elements of Defence expenditure have been critically reviewed in order to deliver the required savings. Some of the measures to reduce costs in the past three years have included reductions in the number of military and civilian personnel, the further rationalisation and consolidation of the Defence property portfolio and reductions in paid training for members of the Reserve. </p><p>  Equipment procurement has been curtailed in line with priority operational requirements and the Defence Organisation is fully participating in central initiatives to deliver further efficiencies such as procurement reform and shared services initiatives. </p><p>  Arising from the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011, the Government decided to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel. A major reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force is ongoing and this will ensure that within the reduced strength, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force is maintained. This is being achieved through the rationalising of headquarters, administrative and support functions and re-balancing force elements in favour of &ldquo;front line&rdquo; operational Units.</p><p>  The Defence Organisation is a leader in public sector reform and has acquired experience and a proven track record for successful reform and ongoing modernisation. The required savings of recent years, in both pay and non-pay, have necessitated a flexible and adaptive approach from the Defence Organisation. A key focus has been the prioritisation and maintenance of Permanent Defence Force operational capacity in order to ensure that the Permanent Defence Force retain the capacity to fulfil all roles assigned.</p><p>  In total, these measures have facilitated a reduction in the Gross Provision for the Defence Vote (36) from &euro;756m in 2010 to &euro;727m in 2011 and &euro;688m in 2012. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the Permanent Defence Force will remain a well trained and well equipped military organisation which is capable of meeting the roles laid down by Government both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

In relation to security, primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.</p><p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.  The Defence Forces alert system is based on a graduated response, which ensures that the required level of readiness and commitment by the Defence Forces can be readily achieved. As a support agency the Defence Forces deploy capabilities that are integral to their military and contingency roles and training is in relation to these capabilities rather than specific capabilities for natural disasters or possible terrorist attacks.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-07a.35.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110700061#WRB02400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 23, 25, 35, 164 and 165 together.</p><p>  The current reorganisation of the Defence Forces was in response to the Government decision to stabilise the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel. At this revised strength ceiling, the existing organisational structures that had been in place for a strength ceiling of 11,500 personnel were no longer viable. Accordingly I initiated a major reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force. The purpose of the reorganisation is to ensure that within the reduced strength, the operational effectiveness of the Permanent Defence Force is prioritised. </p><p>  In July of this year, the Chief of Staff and Secretary General submitted agreed reorganisation proposals for my consideration, which I accepted. These proposals had due regard to Defence Forces operational requirements and the Chief of Staff confirmed that the proposals would ensure that the Permanent Defence Force could continue to meet all operational requirements within a strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel.</p><p>  The recommendations outlined a Permanent Defence Force Army structure based on two Brigades with the brigade headquarters located in Cork and Dublin. Other key aspects of this reorganisation included the consolidation of under-strength Units and the disestablishment of certain units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and a re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational Units. As part of this process, the number of Army infantry battalions will reduce from nine under-strength infantry battalions to seven full strength infantry battalions. In Dublin two under-strength infantry battalions are being consolidated into one full strength battalion. </p><p>  A fundamental and major organisational change such as this one required a holistic approach rather than focusing on local issues and concerns. The proposed future location of Headquarters and Units were contained in the recommendations I received from the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General having regard to Defence Forces capability and operational requirements. I accepted these recommendations in full. </p><p>  The implementation of the reorganisation is underway and all personnel in the Permanent Defence Force have now been briefed on the reorganisation proposals. They will receive further briefings and advice on the many options available to them as implementation of the reorganisation progresses. </p><p>  The Green and White Paper process is scheduled for completion by the end of 2013. In the context of the immediate financial realities and in order to maintain the operational capabilities of the Permanent Defence Force to the greatest extent possible, it was neither prudent nor practical to delay a reorganisation of the Defence Forces until 2014. </p><p>  I am firmly committed to maintaining the capacity of the Permanent Defence Force to meet their operational requirements. The current reorganisation is an essential part of that process.</p></reply>

There is no separate Defence Ministers&rsquo; Council within the EU Council of Ministers. However, twice a year - once during each Presidency - Defence Ministers attend the formal Foreign Affairs Council.  These Council meetings are held in Brussels or Luxembourg at the invitation of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Baroness Catherine Ashton.  I will attend the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Ministers of Defence in Brussels on Monday 19 November 2012.  The Agenda for the meeting includes an Orientation debate on Defence Policy in view of discussions at the European Council in December 2013, a presentation and discussion on the Defence Task Force which is responsible for coordinating Defence issues within the Commission and in cooperation with the European External Action Service and the European Defence Agency, as well as a discussion on the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy military operations.  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of 2013, I will host an Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Dublin Castle on 12-13 February 2013.</p></reply>

Further to this, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the results of this review of allowances and the outcome of the Government decision on its website at www.per.gov.ie.  In the interests of bringing forward these savings to the paybill, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform wrote to my Department instructing management to immediately engage with staff interests with a view to securing their early agreement to the elimination of certain Defence Forces allowances.</p><p>  While Military Service Allowance and some other allowances may be considered to be part of core pay it is important to understand that the term &quot;Allowances&quot; in the Defence sector covers a variety of payment types that are very different from each other. Some are intended to reimburse expenses and do not actually form part of remuneration. Some payments are made in recognition of particular technical or professional qualifications while other allowances recognise particularly onerous duties whether at home or overseas that fall outside the norms taken into account in setting basic pay while also reflecting the fact that the Defence Forces do not receive overtime.</p><p>  It is also important to recognise that almost two thirds of the payments on allowances is accounted for by the top three categories of allowance, that is, Technician Pay, Security Duty Allowances, and Overseas Peace Support Allowances. The Technical Pay and Security Duty Allowance had previously been selected for review as part of the Defence Sectoral Croke Park Agreement and are currently being addressed with the Representative Associations in accordance with agreed procedures under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Defence Forces. The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under this Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue at this juncture.</p></reply>

On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. There are fourteen UN Security Council Resolutions relating to ISAF, most recently UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2069 (2012), adopted on 9 October 2012. This latest UN Security Council Resolution extended ISAF&rsquo;s mandate for a further year until October 2013.</p><p>  Ireland has participated in the NATO&ndash;led UN mandated mission since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force. </p><p>  The continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF is reviewed annually by the Government. The most recent decision by the Government was on 26 June 2012, when it agreed to continue to provide seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with ISAF for a further period from July 2012, subject to ongoing review by the Minister for Defence. The seven (7) Defence Forces personnel work in staff appointments in planning and administrative roles based in ISAF headquarters in Kabul.  Planning for the drawdown of ISAF generally is currently ongoing and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel from the mission will be coordinated within the context of the overall ISAF drawdown plan.</p></reply>

However, the White Paper on Defence (2000) provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to support the civil authorities in this area and assistance in the prevention of drug smuggling is recognised as a very important part of their duties.</p><p>Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Naval Service, as a member of the Joint Task Force, is also committed to an international initiative, the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics, (MAOC-N). The Centre which was established in 2007 has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea. MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at its Centre in Lisbon. Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force.</p><p>  The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships, which are tasked with coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State.The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.As the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed on drug interdiction operations.  A contract was placed in 2010 for the provision of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service.The acquisition of these new vessels will ensure that the Naval Service can continue to carry out its drug interdiction role in support of the Joint Task Force as well as its other taskings. The first vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2014.The second new vessel will follow one year later.</p><p>  The Air Corps are also involved in efforts to prevent drug trafficking.The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft. These CASA aircraft have an important surveillance capability which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling our Irish Exclusive Economic Zone.  Both Casa aircraft underwent mid-life upgrades, which were completed in 2008. The upgrades included the fitting of state-of-the -art surveillance and communication equipment.  The Air Corps has also, on occasion, carried members of the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purposes of monitoring vessels suspected of smuggling drugs.  I am satisfied that both the Air Corps and Naval Service have the necessary resources to meet all their operational requirements including the support of the civil authorities in the prevention of drug smuggling into this country.</p></reply>

A phased release of material into the public domain is planned.  The first release, primarily web-based and concentrated on 1916 participants, is planned for early 2013.   Regular releases relating to the War of Independence and Civil War will occur in the run up to 2016.  </p><p>  Subsequent releases will have a web element but it is important to note that not all papers on each file will be available online.

The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup were Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway, Estonia and Croatia (2011 only).  </p><p>  Any decision by Ireland to participate in a specific Battlegroup operation is subject to our national sovereign decision-making procedures - &ldquo;Triple Lock&rdquo;, i.e. UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval.  The participation by the Defence Forces in EU Battlegroups increases its interoperability with forces from other Member States.  The costs of equipment and additional training are marginal.  The capabilities and the requisite high-end equipment in respect of Ireland's contributions to the Battlegroups already reside within the Defence Forces.  No military equipment has been purchased specifically for EU Battlegroups.  Training of the manoeuvre elements of the Austro-German Battlegroup took place in the contributing Member States - Irish troops were trained in Ireland.  Unlike the Nordic Battlegroup, there were no joint field exercises or manoeuvre training with other elements in the Austro-German Battlegroup.  Battlegroup training in Ireland is part and parcel of the overall programme of training for rapid deployment elements of the Defence Forces for overseas operations and, in the case of the current Battlegroup, comprises mainly the standard training of reconnaissance formations.    </p><p>  Under the Battlegroup Concept, Battlegroups are designed to be operational within 5-10 days of approval from the Council of the European Union and must be sustainable for at least 30 days which could be extended to 120 days, if resupplied.  Based on previous deployments, the current estimated additional cost for a maximum 120 day Battlegroup deployment would be &euro;10.7 million (excluding allowances and ammunition which are generally already provided for in the Defence Vote).  This cost will only arise if the Battlegroup is actually deployed.  There are no proposals under consideration at this time for the deployment of the Austro/German Battlegroup.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces have participated in UNTSO since 1958. Defence Forces personnel serving with this mission are based in Syria, Israel and Lebanon.     The 5 Defence Forces personnel based in Syria are part of Observer Group Golan (OGG) responsible for the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. Their duties include manning Observation Posts, conducting fortnightly inspections in the area; conducting patrols in the area (3 per fortnight) and conducting other tasks as required.</p><p>  As the security situation in Syria remains highly unstable and volatile,  Defence Forces personnel normally based in  Damascus were relocated by the United Nations from Damascus to United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) accommodation on the Golan Heights,  on 15 October 2012, as a temporary force protection measure. The Irish personnel continue to fulfil their roles from their current location. It is intended that they will return to accommodation in Damascus when the security situation allows it. It is not yet clear when that might be.</p><p>  UNTSO works closely with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and UNDOF. The main objectives of UNTSO are to monitor ceasefires, to supervise armistice agreements and to assist the UN peacekeeping operation in the area.  It also maintains a presence in the Egypt-Israel sector in the Sinai. UNTSO maintains offices in Beirut and Damascus. </p><p>  Six members of the Permanent Defence Force who had been deployed as unarmed military observers to the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) were withdrawn in August 2012 when the missions mandate came to an end.</p></reply>

As I made clear when I addressed the UN General Assembly last September, what is happening in Syria is an affront to humanity, involving indiscriminate violence on an appalling scale which is not just confined to one side.</p><p>  However, I equally made clear in my UNGA address that if events in the Arab world over the past two years have taught us anything, it is that leaders who deny legitimate demands for greater political and economic freedom, and who instead resort to waging war on their own people, will inevitably lose the right to rule.  This clearly applies to Bashar al-Assad and the actions of his regime.  It will ultimately be for the Syrian people to determine their own political future.  The international community must encourage all possible steps to end the violence and to initiate a genuine, inclusive political process within Syria in which all Syrians can freely participate.</p><p>  Ireland is fully supportive of the efforts being made by the UN/League of Arab States Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to promote a political settlement.  Mr Brahimi enjoys the full confidence of the EU and of the international community as he endeavours to broker an early cease fire and to build on the earlier peace efforts undertaken by his predecessor, Kofi Annan.  He is continuing to work closely with all members of the UN Security Council and with regional actors in an attempt to devise a political way forward.  He has also recently met with Syrian Government and Opposition representatives. </p><p>  There will also need to be accountability for the very many serious human rights violations and war crimes committed during the conflict.  The latest report of the UN Commission of Inquiry has clearly recognised that opposition forces are also guilty of committing gross human rights violations, though to a lesser extent than the Syrian Government.  Ireland has consistently and strongly condemned all abuses and crimes and has called for the perpetrators, no matter who they are, to be brought to justice.  That is why I continue to support the calls which have been made for the situation in Syria to be referred by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court.</p><p>  Ultimately, it remains for the Syrian people themselves to determine who should lead a new democratic, inclusive and pluralist Syria.  Ireland and its EU and international partners will continue to support all efforts to end the violence and suffering of the Syrian people and to promote the earliest possible political settlement and transition within Syria.</p></reply>

In its most recent resolution, adopted on 14 June 2012, the committee expressed its regret that, in spite of the widespread international support for negotiation between the two Governments, implementation of General Assembly resolutions on the question had not yet started.  The Governments were requested to consolidate the current process of dialogue and cooperation through the resumption of negotiations in order to find as soon as possible a peaceful solution to the dispute relating to the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), in accordance with resolutions 2065 (XX) and 3160 (XXVIII), among others.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-07a.95.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012110700064#WRE01500"><p>At the outset the Deputy should note that individual decisions on pricing and underwriting are a commercial matter for insurance companies and neither I, nor the Central Bank, has any influence over this matter.  I have been informed that each application for flood cover is considered on a case by case basis, as this allows an insurance company to properly assess the risk it is accepting.  The significance of these risks is reflected in the fact that the IIF has indicated that the cumulative cost of the eight major flood events since the year 2000 has been &euro;697 million. </p><p>  The State has made a significant contribution to reducing the threat of flooding through a very significant investment in major urban flood defence schemes since 1995 and this has been hugely beneficial in terms of properties protected and losses avoided.  It is estimated that almost 8,000 properties have been protected to date and the value of the benefit deriving from that is of the order of &euro;800 million.  </p><p>  The approach agreed by the Government in order to ensure reasonable priced flood insurance is provided is twofold and works to improve the availability of flood insurance cover by (a) continuing prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the OPW and relevant local authorities, and (b) improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas and how this can allow more effective insurance cover.  </p><p>  Continued communication between the insurance industry and the OPW is critical to ensure that individual underwriters are aware of what is being done in different parts of the country to address flooding problems including time scales, completion of flood prevention measures, level of expenditure and likely completion dates.  In the same way a flow of information from the insurance industry will undoubtedly help the OPW and local authorities prioritise remedial works which in turn should provide greater reassurance to the industry that problem areas are being addressed in a structured way and this should lead to a greater willingness to provide cover in marginal areas.</p><p>  As part of this, officials in the OPW have been working on developing a system for presenting information on flood defence schemes to the insurance industry to meet the technical requirements set out by the industry for risk assessment purposes.  On 5 July 2012, the OPW made a presentation to the IIF and a number of the main insurance companies on a proposed template for providing the required information.  The essential focus and objective of OPW's work has been in putting flood defence information on a GIS platform.  This means that the information will be accessible and viewable in a mapping environment.</p><p>  I understand that the IIF has indicated that it is in the process of collating the responses it has received from its members on the OPW information and it hopes to be in a position shortly to formally respond on this.  I note that the Chief Executive of the IIF stated in a recent presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht that   &quot;one of the positive developments over the past couple of years is that there has been much more engagement on a bilateral basis with the OPW&quot;.  He acknowledged that the flow of information is much improved and that the insurance industry is much more involved in the process.</p></reply>

The incentive is designed to help companies to raise new risk capital to expand their activities. An individual investor can obtain income tax relief on investments up to a maximum of &#8364;150,000 per annum, subject to the high income individuals' restriction, in each tax year up to 2013. The maximum amount that may be raised by a company in any 12 month period is &#8364;2.5 million, subject to a lifetime limit of  &#8364;10 million. </p><p>  The maximum rate of tax relief available to an individual who subscribes for new ordinary shares is 30% of the amount invested. However, a further 11% tax relief may be available at the end of the holding period, provided the company concerned has either increased its number of employees or spent at least 30% of the investment raised on research and development.</p><p>  Seed Capital Scheme (SCS)</p><p>  The SCS is designed for individuals who are or were in employment, which was subject to PAYE. In general, it operates by providing that an eligible individual, who makes an investment in new ordinary shares in a qualifying company, may set off the amount of that investment against his or her taxable income in any of the previous 6 years, which will result in an overpayment of tax. The individual may then claim a refund of the tax overpaid. For example, an individual, who makes an investment of &#8364;10,000 in new ordinary shares and who sets off the amount of that investment against his or her taxable income for a year of assessment in which his or her marginal rate of tax was 41%, will be entitled to claim a tax refund of &#8364;4,100.</p><p>  The maximum investment that can be set against taxable income in any single year of assessment is &#8364;100,000. This means that the maximum total investment that can be made under the Seed Capital Scheme is &#8364;600,000, as the individual may set up to &#8364;100,000 against the taxable income   of each of the previous 6 years.</p><p>  An eligible individual is an individual who takes up full-time employment with the company and holds at least 15% of the issued ordinary share capital for the required period, normally 3 years.</p><p>  A qualifying company is a new company that carries on a trade except where the activities of that trade consist of-:<blockquote>  (a)activities which were previously carried on by another person and to which the company has succeeded, or<br /><br />  (b)activities which were previously carried on as part of another person&#8217;s trade or profession.</blockquote>  Film Relief (Section 481)</p><p>  The film relief scheme was introduced to promote the Irish film industry, by encouraging investment in Irish made films. Tax relief on the full amount of the investment is available to individual investors at their marginal rate of tax (41% for top rate taxpayers). Individual investors can invest up to &#8364;50,000 under the scheme in any year of assessment. The maximum amount which can be raised by a film production company, under the scheme is 80% of the total cost per production, subject to a maximum of &#8364;50,000,000.</p></reply>

It is also a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.  However, in general, the marginal tax rate, which is described as the tax rate that applies to the last euro of the base, is an important consideration in the formulation of tax policy.  Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more.  The OECD in its working paper &lsquo;Tax and Economic Growth&rsquo;  points to the &ldquo;possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&rdquo;. </p><p>  It is also important to point out that higher marginal tax rates for earners may also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute to the development of a shadow economy.</p><p>  Regardless of the state of the economic cycle, gross migration flows to and from Ireland are very large in comparative terms, indicative of the extremely open nature of the Irish labour market.  By way of background, net migration turned rapidly from positive to negative between the years ending April 2008 and April 2010, evidence of the rapid response of workers to labour market conditions in Ireland during that period.</p></reply>

Where the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement is not met and if the person decides not to purchase an annuity, he/she, as an alternative, can invest in an AMRF.  The &ldquo;specified income requirement&rdquo; applies to all AMRF holders</p><p>  The capital amount that must be invested in an AMRF is 10 times the annual rate of the State (Contributory) Pension, currently &euro;119,800 or, if lower, the balance of the pension fund after the person concerned has taken his/her permitted tax-free lump sum payment.  </p><p>  Unlike an ARF, only income growth in excess of the original capital investment may be withdrawn from an AMRF.  </p><p>  An AMRF converts into an ARF once the AMRF holder reaches the age of 75 years or he/she satisfies the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement, at which point withdrawals of the capital may be made from the ARF (that is, the converted AMRF). </p><p>  It is important to bear in mind that the capital in an AMRF may be used, at any time, to purchase an annuity that would be payable for the duration of the person&rsquo;s life but the capital in the AMRF is not otherwise available to the beneficial owner of the AMRF.  The reason for this is because the AMRF fund is designed to meet the income requirements in the latter part of a person&rsquo;s life (that is, from the age 75 onwards) in a situation where that person does not have alternative income source/s of an amount that equates to 1.5 times the rate of the State (Contributory) Pension.   </p><p>  In my reply to the previous question referred to by the Deputy, I outlined in considerable detail the changes made to provide flexible options at retirement for individuals in Defined Contribution pension arrangements, including the rationale for the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement and the approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF) outlined above. I also outlined the changes made in Finance Act 2011 to extend the flexible options and to modify the conditions relating thereto.</p><p>  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the person referred to in the details supplied with this question took out his AMRF a little over a year ago and after the Finance Act 2011 changes but presumably in the knowledge of the conditions attaching to investment in such a fund.</p><p>  At this point, the only immediate option open to the person concerned to access the capital in the AMRF (based on the information available) would be to use the funds to purchase a pension annuity. He would not be obliged to use all of the funds in the AMRF for this purpose unless he decided to do so and any lifetime pension annuity would count (together with any State Pension Contributory to which the person may be entitled in the future) towards meeting the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement which, if or when satisfied, would allow any remaining AMRF funds to be converted to an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) with unfettered access to the capital before age 75, subject to taxation. </p><p>  I have no plans to adjust the &ldquo;specified minimum income&rdquo; requirement at this time. However, I have received a number of representations about the scale and timing of the increase in the requirement introduced in Finance Act 2011 and I will examine these matters again without prejudice in the context of next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.</p></reply>

I am informed that AIB has written to former senior executives at the bank requesting a voluntary contribution or reduction in their pension.  This process is ongoing as other individuals are written to including former staff of EBS.  I understand that this is a technically complex matter from a Tax and Revenue perspective which will require further analysis.  However, at a minimum, former executives should they choose could make an after-tax contribution of a portion of their pension.  As this is a voluntary request and given that there is a statutory prohibition on reducing pension amounts once the relevant pension is in payment, it will be a matter for the individuals concerned to agree to the amount and scope of the proposal.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Bank that the transfer of assets to the pension fund was undertaken to facilitate the early retirement component of the voluntary severance program of the bank.  If the transfer of assets had not taken place, the early retirement component of the voluntary severance could not have proceeded as it would have required a cash contribution from the bank.  It has been suggested by some that this transaction was designed to fund the grotesque pensions of former chief executives of the bank.  This is not consistent with the facts and is a deliberate misrepresentation of the position.  Given the need for cost savings in the bank, the alternative to the approach adopted by the bank would have been compulsory redundancy and retirement for serving staff.  If this approach had been adopted, the former senior executives would continue to have been paid their massive pensions.  The voluntary severance scheme in the bank overall is expected to result in annual savings to AIB in excess of &euro;200 million which is a critical component of AIB's return to viability.  Additionally, as part of its continuing strategy to meet non-core deleveraging targets as part of PLAR 2011, this transaction facilitated the deleveraging of a substantial non-core portfolio and was executed at a substantial discount to par value.  AIB has informed me that it is not disclosing the discount level, but it was in line with the levels assumed as part of the PCAR exercise in 2011.  The transaction was completed on an arm&rsquo;s length basis with both the bank and the pension trustees conducting independent valuations of the assets.  This transaction was approved by the Board and the Bank's deleveraging committee which includes non-voting observers from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  The bank also consulted with the Pensions Board as part of the process.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report, which I  requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six "centres for teacher education".  Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions. The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.</p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel.  I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.  I will fully consider the implementation plan from the HEA when received.</p></reply>

The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Director of Adult Education, Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion.  Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts.</p><p>  Interim alleviation measures were announced in August 2012 for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level.  School Management bodies were notified of these arrangements at the beginning of the current school year.  Applications for alleviation have been received from 127 post primary schools.  These applications have been processed and schools have been notified of the outcome in the recent weeks.  Following the review of allowances by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department is currently in the process of contacting schools (including the school referred to by the Deputy) that had sought approval to fill vacant assistant principal posts last January and were subsequently unable to complete the appointment process pending the outcome of the review.</p></reply>

I updated my Government colleagues on the rationalisation of state agencies on 31st October 2012.</p><p>  Critical review No.19 of the Agency Rationalisation Programme recommended the merger of the Forensic Science Laboratory into the State Laboratory upon co-location on the Backweston Campus. The review set out that the laboratories have distinct functions and roles as well as different reporting relationships and governance structures. Nonetheless, given the commonalities in certain professional and scientific aspects of their work, there is scope for operational and support synergies and for this reason the Forensic Science Laboratory will be brought within the ambit of the State Laboratory. The operational environment of the Forensic Science Laboratory in the criminal justice system will not be affected by this measure. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Justice and Equality will engage with the two laboratories to identify how best to progress these synergies by the end of 2013.</p></reply>

As part of the Commissioners' ongoing rationalisation programme, there are two projects currently under way which will see space being made available to a further 59 additional staff. The first project involves the development of a back office and training facility for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The CEBs also deliver non-financial supports such as one-to-one mentoring and a range of business advice and training programmes to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises.  These are designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow, and are available, as appropriate, to the needs of a promoter&#8217;s business.  Contact details for the CEBs can be found on </p><p>On 31 October 2012, my colleague, Mr John Perry TD, Minister for Small Business, launched the new Enterprise Ireland &#8364;200,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund aimed at stimulating start-ups and creating jobs and growth in the Midlands Region (Counties Laois, Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly).  This Fund, which can provide up to &#8364;25,000 per project, is now open for applications from entrepreneurs, and will remain open until Tuesday 20 November 2012.</p><p>In 2011, just over 3,700 people were employed on a full-time basis in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Counties Longford and Westmeath and some &#8364;4.3m was paid to companies in these counties for job creation/ retention and business development purposes.  Contact details for Enterprise Ireland can be found at the Agency&#8217;s website </p><p>In order to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises, and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks, the Government on 27 September 2012, established the Microfinance Loan Fund.  The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs of all ages, across the country.</p><p>Microfinance Ireland, (MFI), the company set up to operate the Fund, is  working  closely the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland and are very conscious of the particular difficulties entrepreneurs face with regard to credit history, previous business experience etc. and where they can assist entrepreneurs, they will do so.  However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.</p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 also includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector. These Actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include:</p><p>-a renewed focus on prompt payments to business, </p><p>-an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, </p><p>-the introduction of a Statutory Code of Practice for Grocery Goods;</p><p>-the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms; and</p><p>-the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates. </p><p>Other initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May 2011 also continue to help support employment in the retail sector. These include the halving of Employer&#8217;s PRSI on earnings up to &#8364;356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.</p><p>My officials and I meet with representatives of the retail sector to hear the challenges they face. These engagements will assist us in implementing the above commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs and in identifying any further actions that can be taken to support the sector. </p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department of Social Protection.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has provided &euro;35 million for the school meals programme in 2012.</p><p>As the budget allocation for the school meals programme has not increased in recent years, new applications for inclusion in the scheme are retained on file by my Department and are considered for inclusion as additional funding become available through schools opting out of the programme.  Priority for funding is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skill&rsquo;s initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  All DEIS schools who applied to join the scheme in the previous school year have been invited to participate in the 2012-2013 school meals programme.

Generally the vast majority of cases fall within these average times but extenuating factors, often outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, will cause greater delays in some cases.</p><p>  From about early 2009 the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office has increased dramatically and by 2011 had more than doubled from an average of 15,000 per year to 31,241 in 2011.  A further 29,630 have been received for the period January to October this year.  These increases have significantly impacted on the time taken to process appeals.</p><p>  In an effort to reduce the processing times for all appeals, the Department has appointed 15 additional Appeals Officers since 2010.  In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers now serving in the Office to 41.  In addition to this the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.</p><p>  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</p></reply>

The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The first step in the elimination of the backlog is to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deal with new work as it arrives.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams.  One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Additional resources have been  added to the backlog clearance team.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.  A noted increase in the number of claims processed was achieved in September and October, where claims processed substantially exceeded claim intake, and this increase continues into November.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.  The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored. </p></reply>

The National Archives Advisory Council will be retained, with a reduced membership operating <i>pro bono</i>. A single statutory NLI and NMI Advisory Council will operate <i>pro bono</i>   in place of the existing boards. Board membership will be reduced overall by some 60%.  It is anticipated that this model will achieve significant savings and increase efficiencies across the institutions. The NAI will continue to operate, as currently, with a statutorily independent Director, within the ambit of my Department, and a similar model will be put in place for the Directors of the NLI and NMI.  A robust shared services model will be deployed - through my Department in relation to corporate support services and by formal inter-institutional agreement in relation to operational services. </p><p>  In light of the foregoing in relation to ensuring statutory independence for the Directors of the institutions, I do not consider that any issue arises in relation an 'arms length principle' as suggested by the Deputy. </p><p>  The Deputy should note that savings of &#8364;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money were targeted in the Public Service Reform Plan.  In this context, it is expected that savings in the region of approximately &#8364;1m will be made initially across the institutions involved in the reform programme which are funded from my Department's Vote Group, with further savings to be identified as the various cost saving measures are implemented.</p></reply>

The obligation currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  In 2011, the total amount of petroleum motor fuel placed on the market was 4,276 million litres of which 145 million litres or 3.39% were biofuel, which equated to 2.7% of the total energy requirement in road transport and which displaced approximately 115 million litres of petroleum fuels.  Taking into account the double certificates issued for biofuel produced from wastes a total of 194 million biofuel certificates were issued in 2011 which equates to 4.54% of relevant disposals during the year.  The Biofuel Obligation will increase over time (with the first increase happening in 2013) requiring suppliers of road transport fuels to make certain that even higher volumes sold are biofuel.</p><p>  Prior to the commencement of the MOTR schemes and the Biofuel Obligation Scheme, market penetration of biofuels in Ireland was almost non existent but since their introduction the energy supplied by biofuels in road transport has risen steadily each year from less than 0.1% in 2006 to 2.7% in 2011.  </p></reply>

The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  The precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will be not be identified until that process is completed.  I would reiterate however, that the Government is committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

Following extensive cross checking and quality control to remove duplications and ensure accuracy of all data entries, the confirmed extent of homelessness in the Dublin region as at September 2011 was 1,891 persons. PASS, which commenced operation in the Dublin region in 2011, is being extended nationally on a phased basis with work currently underway in other regions. The PASS system will in future provide good quality, timely, data on homelessness nationally as an evidence base for all homelessness services.</p><p>  The Housing Agency&#8217;s Housing Needs Assessment 2008 and 2011 reports break down the categories of housing need, including in respect of homelessness, for all 88 housing authorities nationwide. These are available on my Department&#8217;s website at <font color="#0000FF">.</font></p><p>  This statutory assessment of housing need, carried out every three years by all housing authorities, only counts homeless persons where an application has been made to a housing authority.</p><p>  On 6 September 2012, the CSO published its special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland</i> and it indicated that 3,808 persons were either sleeping rough or in accommodation designated for the homeless on the night of 10 April 2011. The rough sleeper count was 64, with 59 of those people located in Dublin. It is not tolerable that anyone should sleep on the streets but it is important that the homeless figures released are not confused with the number of people sleeping rough. The vast majority of people classified in the CSO's report as homeless are in long-term or emergency accommodation.</p><p>  Government policy envisages a move away from the traditional bed and breakfast accommodation with the emphasis on housing authorities adopting a housing led approach. This will reduce the amount of time spent in homeless services, in particular bed and breakfast accommodation, eliminate the need to sleep rough and place prevention at the forefront of the delivery of services.</p><p>  I intend to issue a policy statement on homelessness shortly. That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies. I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.</p><p>  My Department&#8217;s current funding provision for the running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2012 is &#8364;50 million, which, together with 10% provided from housing authorities&#8217; own resources, brings the total available funding to &#8364;55.55 million in 2012. This level of funding means that there will be no reduction in the provision of essential frontline support services.</p></reply>

The new regulations will provide, among other things, for the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met in relation to the building concerned. Drawings and particulars demonstrating compliance must also be submitted to the local building control authority. In addition a building owner will be required to assign a registered professional to inspect the work during construction and also to certify that the completed building is in compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.

The procurement of products or services by a local authority is a matter for the authority concerned.  Notwithstanding this, guidelines by the National Public Procurement Policy Unit (NPPPU) of the Department Public Expenditure and Reform apply to all public sector bodies, including local authorities.      </p><p>  I am advised that t he rules on awarding public contracts have provisions which allow the specification of social criteria, such as the requirement for employment of long term unemployed, as a condition in the performance of the contract.   Any such provisions must be compatible with EU law, i.e. they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.   Subject to this, contracting authorities have the discretion to apply such conditions, as appropriate.   </p><p>  Under the EU Directives on public procurement, public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised in the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria.  For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website  or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.   </p><p>  The aim of the rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and where the EU Directives apply there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  The local government sector avails of a number of shared procurement mechanisms already in place (nationally &#8211; National Procurement Service (NPS) frameworks, LA Quotes/Bitumen, and regionally &#8211; library service procurement, public lighting maintenance, debt collection, paid parking, etc.), and local authorities will support and operate under Mandatory Frameworks for procurement as they are developed. </p><p>  A new procurement governance structure is currently being put in place in the local government sector comprising a lead procurement local authority (Kerry County Council), specialist procurement support units and regional procurement co-ordinators. In addition, each county and city council has a designated Procurement Officer in place.   </p><p>  Government initiatives in relation to procurement are reshaping the way the State and business engages in relation to acquisition of goods and services. Sensitivity regarding Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) is needed to maximise local buy-in particularly with regard to pre-qualification criteria required in order to meet eligibility thresholds when tendering for public contracts.  In this regard, while local authorities provide a measure of support for SMEs in engaging with procurement processes (e.g. the LA Quotes website) they will work with the National Procurement Service as they further develop and disseminate guidance in order to assist SMEs in tendering for public contracts, and assist local authorities doing a similar job locally. </p><p>  As part of the implementation of the local government sectoral strategy to promote employment and support local enterprise, Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs &#8211; Locally , local authorities will also work as necessary with the responsible State   agencies in the development of the Procuring Innovation initiative (Action 3.53 of the Action Plan for Jobs) to increase the purchasing of innovative solutions from SMEs by encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering that focuses on procuring solutions to specific needs, rather than specific products or services.  In view of the importance of improving the capacity of SMEs to compete under the framework agreement approach, local authorities will also work with Enterprise Ireland to ensure that pre-qualifying criteria for the award of public contracts that are subject to frameworks will be proportionate to the relative value of the contract, so that pre-qualification is not unnecessarily weighted against SMEs.   </p><p>  While public procurement policy addresses the inclusion of social clauses in public contracts, the application of such clauses in public contracts is a matter for each contracting authority concerned.</p></reply>

The PRA has been in continuing discussions with the OPW to finalise the proposed re-location of staff.

While the policing plan for 2013 has not yet been finalised, it will be laid before the House in due course.  Until then it would be premature to speculate on what it might contain.  In preparing the policing plan, the Garda Commissioner reviews all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda Districts and Stations, in terms of resource allocation, the opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers are asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area, including the ones referred to by the Deputy. It must be stressed that the key objective of the review is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings so that as many Garda&iacute; as possible are deployed on front line operational duty rather than based in Garda Stations.</p></reply>

The proposed reforms are intended, if approved in a referendum, to facilitate the establishment of a new separate Family Courts structure which will streamline family law court processes and make them more efficient and less costly.  Considerable work will be necessary to develop these proposals and this has already commenced in my Department.  A decision on the timing of the necessary referendum will be made at a later date. </p><p>In addition, on 31 October 2012 the Government approved my proposals for the urgent drafting of a Bill to amend the <i>in </i>camera rule in order to introduce greater transparency in the administration of family and child care law.  The existing statutory privacy provisions in respect of family and child care court proceedings will be retained while allowing the attendance in court of <i>bona fide</i>  members of the press as is the case in the trial of sexual offences.  A strict prohibition will apply on reporting of material likely to identify the parties to the proceedings and any children to which the proceedings relate.  Media access and reporting of cases will add transparency to the conduct of family law and child care proceedings and will provide valuable information on the operation of the law.</p><p>  As I indicated in response to Question No. 10 of 24 October 2012, there are also alternatives to court available in the area of family law and I intend to bring forward, in the coming months, a Bill to promote mediation as a viable and cost effective alternative to court proceedings.  The main objective of the Bill is the reduction of legal costs, the speeding up of dispute resolution and the lessening of the stress involved in court proceedings.  These provisions are designed to ensure that the legal framework supports the parties in reaching an agreed and enduring resolution to their disputes where possible.  </p></reply>

The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible. The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service. The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003 and it aims to fulfil various obligations placed on the State by the European Convention on Human Rights and, particularly, the Article 2 requirement in relation to the investigation of deaths of persons involving the State. </p><p>The key elements of the Bill include&#8212;   <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>  -   enhancing inquiry and inquest processes,<br /><br />  -  establishing the office of Chief Coroner to provide leadership and direction in all coronial matters; <br /><br />  -  providing the necessary legal framework for the establishment of a new Coroner Service;<br /><br />  -  moving to a smaller number of full-time coroners; <br /><br />  -  statutory requirement to ensure that family members are notified at significant steps of the coronial process;<br /><br />  -  clarifying a specific regime for coroner post-mortem examinations, including provision for retention and release of body parts and bodily samples, and <br /><br />  -  promoting cooperation between coroners and other agencies also involved in investigations of deaths.<br /><br />It would be my hope to progress the Coroners Bill next year.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><br /><br />  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for some early reforms in coronial matters, including an amalgamation of the Dublin County and City coronial districts.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

It allows tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa. The Government decided on 12 March 2012 to extend the Programme for a further period of four years i.e. to end October 2016 in the light, particularly, of the positive response from tourism agencies and operators.</p><p>  The programme applies to nationals of seventeen countries ( increasing from sixteen on 1 November 2012 to include nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina  ) mainly from Asia (including China and India), the former Soviet Union and the Gulf and Middle East regions all of which are regarded as key development markets for Irish business and tourism interests.  The programme has been widely welcomed by the business and tourism sectors as an aid to developing important overseas markets.  </p><p>  Tourism Ireland, the organisation responsible for promoting the island of Ireland overseas as a leading holiday destination, has reported some significant success indicators for the Programme:<blockquote>-36 new tour operator itineraries from China have been established since the start of the Programme.<br /><br />-Existing Chinese tour operators have added almost 2,500 people to their tours between July 2011 and August 2012.<br /><br />-Publicity about the Programme in China generated the equivalent of over &#8364;855,000 of advertising in the same period.<br /><br />-20 tour operators in India have reported new itineraries or additional passengers since the launch of the Programme.<br /><br />- A number of tour operators in the Gulf region have added Ireland to their tourist itineraries for the first time.</blockquote>It has not been possible to ascertain exactly how many people have made use of the Visa Waiver Programme as the only comprehensive way of doing so would be to check all persons arriving at ports of entry in Ireland. It was considered that the potential disruption to tourists, especially during peak summer  months, outweighed the benefit to be got from having an exact count of usage of the Waiver.  It is proposed, however, to conduct a focussed survey to provide information from which the use of the programme can be extrapolated. The methodology of such a survey will take into account the need to ensure as speedy a transit through immigration control for legitimate tourists and business visitors as possible.   </p><p>  My Department is constantly seeking ways in which the visa system can facilitate increased business and tourism  from growing markets and, in this regard, meets regularly with tourism and business promotion agencies to discuss initiatives in this area.</p></reply>

No fee is normally paid for the review of disclosed material as this is deemed to be covered by the brief fee.  The regulations also allow for the following claims for fees and expenses to be paid in certain circumstances:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>  (a) solicitor and counsel can claim a fee of &#8364;97.22 in respect of any visit to a person in prison that is essential to the preparation and conduct of the person's defence and &#8364;91.52 in respect of a contested bail application to the Circuit Court or Special Criminal Court;<br /><br />  (b) a consultation fee in connection with a criminal legal aid case (other than on a hearing date) can be claimed by solicitor and counsel where their client is on bail (amount depends on the duration of the consultation).  </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

Garda Divisional Officers have been advised of measures which can be put in place to prevent and reduce the opportunity for such crime, involving relevant external stakeholders where appropriate.  Crime Prevention officers are also engaged in providing advice to members of the public, businesses and other organisations, including in the context of the locations referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>  Tackling such crime requires a collaborative effort and targeted multi-agency response. Following an analysis of crime trends, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established a metal theft forum involving stakeholders particularly affected by this type of crime, including the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers association, the Electricity Supply Board, telecoms, transport companies, brewing concerns and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  A Metal Theft Crime Prevention and Reduction Plan is at an advanced stage of development following discussion with the metal theft forum.  I look forward to the outcome of this process so that a properly considered and strategic response can be put in place, to supplement the existing crime prevention and detection operations which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have in place to tackle this type of crime.</p></reply>

Examples of this response in recent years are: the establishment of countrywide designated support teams to assist in response to the threat of an Avian Flu outbreak in 2008; provision of wide ranging support from the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service during the extensive flooding experienced in 2009 and the assistance provided to the Principal Response Agencies during the prolonged periods of severe weather from November 2009 to January 2010 and from November 2010 to December 2010.  An ash plume caused by a series of volcanic eruptions in Iceland in April and May 2010 resulted in widespread disruption to air traffic and throughout this period the Naval Service provided Search and Rescue cover on the South West coast as the Irish Coastguard could not fly helicopters in the area.  The Naval Service also was on standby to transfer HSE patients to the UK.  In 2011 the Air Corps and the Army responded to a request from the Local Authorities to assist in fire-fighting efforts in Counties Donegal and Mayo where forest and gorse fires had broken out.</p><p>  The recent reorganisation in the Defence Forces encompasses a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from three to two larger Brigades, a reduction in the number of headquarters, re-deployment of personnel to operational Units, the consolidation of under-strength Units and the disestablishment of certain Units.  I am committed to maintaining the capacity of the Permanent Defence Force to meet their operational requirements and I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the ability to fulfil all roles that may be assigned to them in response to an emergency or crisis event.</p></reply>

However, the White Paper on Defence provides a role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this work.  In this regard, the Air Corps and the Naval Service provide support to these agencies as the need arises and within their available capabilities.    A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard which sets out the search and rescue assistance that the Air Corps and Naval Service can provide to the Coast Guard. The provision of onshore assistance by Air Corps helicopters for mountain rescue operations is covered in the agreement as is the fixed wing top cover by the Air Corps Casa aircraft to Coast Guard helicopters offshore.  Assistance that is provided by the Naval Service to the Coast Guard during maritime search and rescue and recovery operations is also included in the Service Level Agreement.</p><p>  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.</p><p>  Furthermore, Ireland along with other EU Member States participate in the EU Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC-N).  This Centre has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.  MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force.</p><p>  Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on fishery patrol. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. </p><p>  In relation to maritime surveillance generally, an Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Working Group, chaired by the Department of Transport, was established under the auspices of the Marine Co-ordination Group.  The Group is working towards the creation of a common information-sharing environment to enhance safety and security within the Irish maritime domain.</p><p>  I am satisfied that both the Air Corps and Naval Service have the necessary resources to meet their operational requirements in these important areas.</p></reply>

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.<b></b>  Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals. According to the CSO Cereals Supply Balance sheet, Ireland had 74% self-sufficiency in cereals in 2010/2011. Imports of cereals in that period amounted to 938,000 tonnes, down 14% or 155,000 tonnes on the previous year. </p><p>  Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies.  In 2010, increased demands for grain from the biofuels sector and the growing needs of new emerging markets like China and India drove up world grain market prices.  In line with this rise in world prices, grain prices in Ireland increased and growers here reacted by increasing the acreage sown.  This resulted in a bumper harvest in 2011 with total grain production of almost 2.5m tonnes. The preliminary estimate for the 2012 grain harvest is forecast to be lower than the record harvest of 2011 due to the persistent adverse weather during the growing season and will be of the order of 2 million tonnes, despite a significant increase in cereal area planted in 2011. </p><p>  This is consistent with the long-term average production of 2 million tonnes but 20% lower than the 2011 harvest figure of 2.5 million tonnes, which was exceptionally high. </p><p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. </p><p>  Ireland is also a significant importer of field vegetables and potatoes. Most of the Department&#8217;s efforts, along with those of the State Agencies involved with the horticultural industry, are focussed on increasing production for the domestic market.   The opportunity for increasing outdoor horticultural crops production has become more difficult over the past five years.  This is due to scale of the industry, our costs of production, competition from major suppliers around the world and the controls exercised by the supermarkets. The very difficult weather conditions over the past 5 years, including 2 very severe winters plus the very poor summer weather this year, have further restricted the industry&#8217;s capacity to expand production.</p></reply>

Ireland is strategically placed to be a key supplier of quality meats, dairy products, beverages, seafood and other products and services to China.  In 2011, Ireland exported &euro;244m of these products to China.  In the first six months of this year, Ireland has exported &euro;181m in dairy products, pigmeat, seafood, beverages and other agri-related products to China. This is a 39% increase on the same period last year, at which time we had exported &euro;130m.  Total exports of Irish seafood to China in 2011 were &euro;2.9 million, but the latest data up to July 2012 shows exports of seafood at &euro;5.3 million, representing an 80% increase on 2011. This dramatic increase demonstrates the new business relationships Ireland has developed with key Chinese buyers. </p><p>  Last April I lead the largest ever Irish agri-food trade delegation to China, with representatives from the meat, dairy, seafood, beverages, bloodstock and agri-services sectors and government bodies. The trade delegation which my Department, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland brought together, comprised of a total of 51 Irish companies and 127 individual.  This was in addition to Government agencies such as Teagasc, BIM, the Marine Institute, the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing and leading universities involved in the provision of educational courses in food safety and agricultural science. </p><p>  During the Trade Mission, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between my Department and the Chinese Inspection and Quarantine Service (AQSIQ) on (i) sanitary and phyto sanitary issues, including provision for the establishment of a joint working group on SPS issues, b) the export of horse feed to China, and c) renewal of the bovine semen protocol was concluded.  The MOU between my Department and the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture on Mutual Cooperation in the Agri-food and Fisheries areas was also renewed and a new MOU was signed between the Marine Institute and the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences; this MOU builds on research work between the two institutions, facilitated by the Action Plan which I agreed with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture in May 2011 on Mutual Cooperation.</p><p>  In addition, some significant commercial outcomes were also achieved during the visit including the announcement of a $50 million project involving an Irish company in a joint venture in establishing a major Chinese equine facility; market access and conclusion of a contract by an Irish company for the supply of horsefeed to China, the first foreign company to gain such a contract; the signing of agreements between BIM and eight Irish Seafood companies to supply China with commercial samples of boar fish to China; the conclusion of an agreement by an Irish dairy company on an increased volume of dairy and nutritional ingredients to be supplied to the Chinese market and the launch of a range of Irish dairy products on the Chinese market.</p><p>  Meeting were also held with  a range of number of Chinese food companies which have lead to increased business opportunities and in one case a significant partnership agreement in terms of the supply of infant formula has since been concluded.</p><p>  Since my visit there have been a number of follow on visits to Ireland by Chinese Ministers including Vice Minister Gao Hongbin of the Ministry of Agriculture with responsibility for Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Controls, who visited in May and Vice Minister Wei Chuanzhong of AQSIQ who visited in June. This latter visit resulted in the signing of Protocols on the direct export of horses from Ireland to China and on the export of fresh porcine semen to China. In addition, an MOU was concluded on the setting up of a technical working group on BSE, for market access for Irish beef. That working group has now been established. </p><p>  The Mayor of Nanjing, Ji Jianye, who I met when in China also made a visit to Ireland in August, and was accompanied by one of the world&rsquo;s largest pigmeat processors. There have also been follow up visits in relation to the purchase of thoroughbred horses.  In relation to the seafood sector, trade in boarfish with China has commenced and opportunities for developing this trade are being assessed. </p><p>  At government agency level, the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Science made a return visit in July of 2012 to investigate research possibilities with the Marine Institute. The areas of aquaculture and fisheries technology and sea food safety were of particular interest, and the group were shown the Institute&rsquo;s research activities in bio-toxin chemistry, fish stock assessment, micro-tagging of hatchery juvenile fish and fish genetics. Continuing collaboration is currently being scheduled. In October AQSIQ visited the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency.</p><p>  Following from the Irish/ Sino Forum on Building a Safe and Sustainable Future of Food Production, which took place during my visit to China, Teagasc and the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences are now developing a Memorandum of Understanding which it is envisaged will lead to collaborative research between both Institutes.</p><p>  While all these developments have led to greater cooperation and the deepening of relationships and trust at Ministerial, official and business level, which is crucial to trade in China, the evidence of the importance of this relationship to the Irish agri-food and seafood sector is reflected in the trade statistics and the continuing growth in our exports to China.</p><p>  Overall, I am very pleased with the outcome of my trade visit to China and the very important follow up in terms of return visits by Ministers and industry, the growing collaboration between government agencies in areas of research and mutual cooperation and the tangible commercial outcomes. I would anticipate that our agri-food and seafood exports to China will continue to grow. </p></reply>

However since 2008 Ireland has participated in the COLOSS Research Network which is investigating possible causes of honeybee colony mortality worldwide.  This network involves a collaboration of researchers from over 50 countries using standardised research methods to provide directly comparable results. Ireland&rsquo;s first comprehensive survey on colony losses for COLOSS took place over the winter of 2008-2009.  Since then the survey has been repeated annually.  Participation in the COLOSS Network forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Apiculture Programme which is currently conducted by University of Limerick in conjunction with Teagasc.  Ireland&rsquo;s National Apiculture Programme is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with 50% co-funding provided by the EU Commission.</p><p>  As part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s pesticide registration process the effect on honeybee health as well as the wider ecosystem is considered before any decision is made to permit the use of a pesticide in Ireland.</p><p>  Pesticides and especially insecticides can have a negative impact on honeybee mortality, however the presence of the varroa mite and its associated viruses are considered to be to be the most significant cause of colony weakening / mortality.</p></reply>

Leitrim in October. Since then measures were taken to protect our ash trees from the spread of this disease. Firstly all material from the imported consignment concerned was destroyed. In addition, I put in place legislation banning the import of ash plants from countries or parts of countries known to have the disease. This Statutory Instrument came into effect from the 26<sup>th</sup> October 2012 and in Northern Ireland equivalent measures were simultaneously introduced.</p><p>  Further legislation was introduced this week to control the import of ash wood into the country. The details of this legislation, which came into effect yesterday, have also been agreed with Northern Ireland.  The legislation will allow ash wood movement into Ireland if (1) it comes from an area free of the disease or (2) its free of outer round surface (including bark) or (3) its kiln dried below 20% moisture.</p><p>  In terms of research, support is provided through my Department under the COFORD programme for studies on broadleaf tree improvement. This work is being undertaken principally in University College Dublin, in close collaboration with Coillte and Teagasc, with the aim of improving the future quality and productivity of Irish forests. In addition my Department has identified a number of ash plantations for inclusion on the official Seed Stand Register of Ireland. Seed from these plantations will have better growth characteristics than seed from unselected stands.

It is important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board. To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill gives a prescriber the option of indicating on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 was published on the 13th of July 2012.

This performance indicator is reported on monthly in the HSE's Performance Report.  In July (the most recent Performance Report available), 100% of complete applications were determined within four weeks.  An application is complete when the Nursing Home Support Office has received all of the necessary documentation and information required to make a determination.  Depending on the level of complexity of the individual case, processing of the application may take longer.  For example, in cases where ancillary State support is sought, additional factors may impact on the timeframe, e.g. the HSE must establish title of a property before a decision can be made and establishing title can be a lengthy process in some cases.    </p><p>  Funding for the Scheme is issued to applicants in chronological order by the date of determination of their application.  This ensures equity nationally.  Funding is currently being released by the HSE on a weekly basis.</p></reply>

There is a growing interest in the "self care" agenda and it is acknowledged that pharmacists have a key role to play in the treatment of minor ailments.  A recent example of extending the pharmacist role is pharmacist participation in the roll-out of the seasonal 'flu vaccination programme in 2011 and 2012.</p><p>  Under the current legislation, the process whereby a medicine is switched from prescription only to pharmacist supply involves the manufacturer of the medicine making an application to the Irish Medicines Board (IMB).  In making such an application, the manufacturer is required to submit appropriate scientific data to demonstrate that the medicine can be safely and correctly used by patients if available without prescription.  A number of medicines have been switched from prescription control to pharmacist supply under this procedure in recent years.  In addition, as part of the overall debate on switching of suitable medicines, the IMB has established a Consultative Panel on method of sale and supply of medicines.  This Panel is representative of relevant stakeholders including my Department, the HSE, health care professionals and their regulatory bodies, patient representatives and industry representatives.  The Panel is expected to conclude its work by the end of this year and its conclusions will be considered by the IMB in 2013.</p></reply>

The prices of such drugs vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT. </p><p>  Following intensive negotiations with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the Department of Health and the HSE have reached agreement on a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State. The main provisions of the new Agreement are as follows:</p><p>  -With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent protected medicines reimbursed in Ireland prior to September 2006 will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and UK). </p><p>-With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent expired medicines which do <i>not</i>   have a generic equivalent on the Irish market will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries.</p><p>-With effect from 1st November 2012, the ex factory price of all patent expired medicines which <i>have </i>  a generic equivalent on the Irish market will be reduced to 60% of the original price. With effect from 1st November 2013, the price will be reduced to 50% of the original price.</p><p>-In the case of medicines which go off patent after 1<sup>st</sup> November 2012, the ex factory price will drop to 70% of the original price as soon as a generic equivalent comes on the Irish market. After 12 months, the price will be reduced to 50% of the original price. </p><p>-With effect from 1st January 2013, the ex factory price of medicines introduced to Ireland <i>after </i>September 1<sup>st</sup>   2006, will be realigned - downwards only - to the average of the basket of 9 countries.</p><p>  The deal will deliver a number of important benefits, including</p><p>  -significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,</p><p>  -a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,</p><p>  -timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions,</p><p>  -reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>    This deal, combined with an interim agreement reached with IPHA in the Summer, means that &#8364;16 million in drug savings will be made this year. It is estimated that the deal will generate savings of up to &#8364;116m in 2013, &#8364;136m in 2014 and &#8364;150m on 2015.  </p><p>    The Department and the HSE have also completed discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry, and have secured similar reductions in the price of drugs supplied by AMPI member companies.  </p><p>    The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  It aims to promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  It should lead to an increase in the rate of generic prescribing, thus generating further savings in drugs expenditure in the years ahead.</p></reply>

Around 60% of these questions concern operational issues and are referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to Deputies. Many of these questions relate to individual patients and local day to day operational matters.</p><p>  Parliamentary Questions relating to operational issues of a national scale or importance are answered by myself or the relevant Minister of State instead of being referred to the HSE. Whenever possible these questions are answered on the relevant D&aacute;il sitting day. Where this is not possible because the information is not readily available, a reply is issued as soon as possible thereafter.  These are classified within my Department as Ministerial Response questions.</p><p>  The statistical data sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of PQs referred and response times since 2005 is set out below. From 2006 to 2007 the Executive worked to a timeframe of issuing responses to directly referred PQs within 20 working days of receipt. From 2008 this was reduced to 15 working days.</p><p>  2005 - 2,388 referred - average response rate not available</p><p>  2006 - 3,060 referred - 55% answered within 20 days</p><p>  2007 - 2,744 referred - 65% answered within 20 days</p><p>  2008 - 3,544 referred - 73% answered within 15 days</p><p>  2009 - 3,145 referred - 62% answered within 15 days</p><p>  2010 - 2,550 referred - 53% answered within 15 days  (Performance in this year was affected by prolonged industrial action) </p><p>  2011 - 2,464 referred - 58% answered within 15 days</p><p>  2012 - 3,049 referred - 75% answered within 15 days</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that responding to the information needs of the Oireachtas is a priority both for my Department and the Executive. As noted above, the Executive is committed, in the 2012 National Service Plan, to answering 75% of directly referred Parliamentary Questions within a period of 15 working days of receipt. Performance in relation to this target it is currently being met and will continue to be monitored closely.  The Executive  introduced a new I.T. system in the last quarter of 2011 and this has  led to a significant improvement in its overall response time to referred questions. The most recent statistics available for this year (up to October 9th) show that of the 3,049 questions referred for direct reply this year, 2,274 (75%) have been answered within the 15 day timeframe. Taking into account questions which took longer than the 15 day timeframe to answer, the figures show that 2,981 (98%) of referred questions have now been answered. The figures for Ministerial Response questions show that of the 496 questions referred to the Executive for input, 464 (94%) have been answered in full.  Regular meetings are held with the HSE's Parliamentary Affairs Division to monitor response times and to emphasise the importance of issuing timely and comprehensive replies to Deputies. </p><p>  Questions concerning individual patients and operational matters relating to local issues will continue to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to Deputies. While my Department has ultimate accountability for the health services, it is my belief that a balance has to be struck between responsibility for local issues, which rests with local area service managers, and the ultimate accountability of Ministers.</p></reply>
