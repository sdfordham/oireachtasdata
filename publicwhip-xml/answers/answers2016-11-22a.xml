    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-22a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112200059#WRA00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 58 together.</p><p>My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p><p>Over &euro;19 billion will be spent by my Department on its various income supports and other programmes in 2016.  </p><p>Across the main social welfare schemes, last month my Department received over 38,000 applications for processing and cleared over 42,000.  The number of applications awaiting decision and the average time to award for each main social welfare scheme is set out in the following table, which was provided to the Deputies earlier today.</p><p>The time taken by my Department to process applications depends on a number of factors, primarily the conditionality and relative complexity that applies to the relevant scheme.  The quality and completeness of the application form and other material is also an important factor.  The inclusion, at the outset, of any supporting documentation that is requested on the application form is key to a customer getting a timely and appropriate decision.</p><p>Long term schemes with medical or caring conditionality are relatively complex to decide upon and, consequently, take longer to process.  When the number applying to any particular scheme increases significantly, it can put pressure on my Department&rsquo;s capacity to process those claims in a timely manner.  </p><p>Reducing waiting times is a priority for my Department and they are working hard to make this happen.  For example, the processing time for carer&rsquo;s allowance has dropped from 22 weeks in May 2016 to 14 weeks in September 2016 and continues to fall.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by my Department in recent years.  In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b><i>Table of Main DSP Schemes (arranged alphabetically) with Number of Applications awaiting decision and Average Weeks to Award</i></b><table><tr><th><div>Scheme</div></th><th><div>Awaiting Decision at end October </div></th><th><div>Average weeks to award</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carer's allowance </td><td><div>3,833</div></td><td><div>14* </div></td></tr><tr><td>Carer's benefit </td><td><div>404</div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Child benefit</td><td><div> 1,400</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disability allowance </td><td><div>5,671</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary care allowance </td><td><div>2,059</div></td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td>Family income supplement (new claims)</td><td><div>3,639</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity pension </td><td><div>2,003 </div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's allowance </td><td><div>6,955</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's benefit </td><td><div>1,741</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>One-parent family payment </td><td><div>1,244 </div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>State pension contributory</td><td><div>4,115</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>State pension non-contributory </td><td><div>1,834  </div></td><td><div>14 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Widow/widower/surviving civil partner contributory pension</td><td><div>309</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widow/widower/surviving civil partner non-contributory pension</td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr></table><b>* Most up-to-date statistics are from the end of September 2016</b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-22a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112200059#WRA01300"><p>Lower weekly rates for younger jobseekers were first introduced in the Supplementary Budget in 2009, and further extended in subsequent Budgets up to 2014.  The rationale for these rates is to prevent young unemployed people from entering longer term welfare dependency by providing a strong financial incentive to take up a job, or a training or education programme.</p>  <p>  The CSO publishes consistent poverty figures for all young people aged 15 to 24 inclusive.  The CSO does not separately report poverty rates for young people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p>  <p>  The consistent poverty rate for all young people aged 15 to 24 was 4.2% in 2008 and peaked at 14% in 2013.  The most current data available relates to 2014 when the consistent poverty rate for young people decreased to 13.1%.  The CSO will release the 2015 SILC data in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Poverty is strongly linked to unemployment.  The number of young people under the age of 26 on the Live Register has fallen from 51,200 to 32,260 over the two years from October 2014 to October 2016, a reduction of 37%.  Similarly, the monthly unemployment rate for 15 to 24 year olds fell from 21.9% to 15.1% over the same period, a reduction of 31%.  It is positive that unemployment among young people is falling at a faster rate than among the general population.</p>  <p>  These trends are very positive.  Of course, more remains to be done and I am determined that we help more young people in the most effective way possible, by supporting them into the workforce, education or training.  </p>  <p>  For that reason, on Budget Day I announced additional incentives for young people to participate in education.  From next September, when a young jobseeker participates on the Back to Education scheme, he or she will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, which will then be &euro;193 per week, as against the &euro;160 which they are currently on.  This is the largest single increase in the social welfare package and demonstrates our commitment to young jobseekers who seek to enhance their skills.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-22a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112200060#WRB00400"><p>My Department values quality social policy research and the contribution it makes in assisting it in terms of informing policy across its broad remit.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from the title of the report, the report does not claim to be an analysis of the lone parent reforms.  It was my Department&rsquo;s expectation that the report would provide detail on the design of specific activation programmes that work for lone parents that could assist in developing further activation measures for these customers.  The fact that it doesn&rsquo;t include that information is a lost opportunity.</p>  <p>  The research commenced in January 2015 and therefore takes no account of the final phase of the one-parent family payment reforms in July 2015, or improvements targeted at lone parents in the last three Budgets which resulted in lone parents benefitting more favourably than the average household.  </p>  <p>  We are still at an early stage of the implementation of the reforms to the one parent family payment and I think it will take several years before the full impact of the reforms can be assessed.  This is because many lone parents, on foot of the reforms, are taking up education, training or employment support programmes, which will take time for them to complete.  </p>  <p>  However, I listened carefully to the views of One Family, and other groups, in the months before the Budget and consequently, I announced a package of measures supporting lone parents in the social welfare Budget package.  </p>  <p>  All lone parents on the one-parent family payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment will rise by &euro;20 from January, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.   </p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill last week, I agreed that I would commission a report on the changes to the one-parent family payment.  I will introduce a Report Stage Amendment to that effect.  The report shall examine the financial and social effects of the changes taking into account poverty rates and welfare dependency of those impacted by the reforms.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2017, I announced an additional &euro;5.7 million for school meals which will benefit over 50,000 children.  </p>  <p>  Additional funding is being provided to DEIS schools already participating in the scheme to provide breakfast and lunch to pupils.  The Department has also written to some 50 DEIS schools not participating in the scheme and invited them to join.  To date, 11 additional DEIS schools have expressed an interest in joining the scheme.</p>  <p>  The additional funding provided in Budget 2017 also provides some provision towards the extension of the scheme to breakfast clubs in non-DEIS schools from September 2017.  This is the first time in many years that increased payments will be provided to schools outside of DEIS.</p>  <p>  More than 50,000 children will benefit from the increased funding providing breakfasts and lunches.  Of these, some 35,000 extra school breakfasts will be provided in non-DEIS schools from the start of the new school year and will be expanded in future years. </p>  <p>  The Youthreach centre referred to by Deputy Crowe, made an application for school meals funding on 30 June 2016.  As the centre is not a DEIS school it was not considered for funding for the current academic year and this information was communicated to the organisation&rsquo;s Co-ordinator. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are engaging with colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills in examining options regarding the provision of the additional funding to schools for the next school year.  Priority will be provided to those schools where there is most need and the availability of funding for Youthreach centres can only be considered in the context of the take up of the support by these schools.</p></reply>

These are structured to encourage and assist people on long-term illness and disability payments to identify and take up available employment, training, educational and other self-development opportunities, where this is appropriate to their underlying conditions.</p>  <p>  These payments and supports make a very significant contribution to broader poverty and social inclusion goals.  However, direct payments do not answer some of the wider social issues affecting people with disabilities, which include a desire for greater participation in the labour market.  Improved employment rates and better co-ordinated supports and services could result in significantly improvement for people with disability.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the former, the Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Employment Strategy seeks to increase employment rates for persons with disability through a series of coordinated measures across a range of Government Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  In relation to the latter, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the role of personalised budgets for persons with a disability.  The Government has established a Task Force on Personalised Budgets to consider the commitment to give people with disabilities greater control, independence and choice in terms of obtaining HSE-funded personal social services and supports, in the first instance.  Personalised budgets transfer control back to the individual and give them the freedom to source the services and supports which best meet their needs.</p></reply>

The benefit is paid for up to two weeks to employed and self-employed people who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions.  The rate of payment is &euro;230 per week, the same as maternity benefit, with possible increases for adult and child dependents.  The purpose of the benefit is to support new fathers to take time off work within the first 26 weeks following the birth of their child.</p>  <p>  I am happy to inform the Deputies that in the period between the introduction of the scheme on 01/09/16 and 15/11/16, a total of 2,846 paternity benefit claims have been awarded.  I can confirm to Deputy McLoughlin that forty two applicants (1.48% of the total awarded) who reside in Co. Sligo and twenty five applicants (0.88% of the total awarded) who reside in Co. Leitrim have been awarded paternity benefit during this period.</p>  <p>  The Department has developed a new system to support the delivery of paternity benefit and to modernise the delivery of maternity benefit.  The new system supports online applications for both paternity and maternity benefits, with some 650 customers having successfully applied online to date.  Online application is the preferred method of application and can result in the speedy notification of an auto award of benefit where the customer satisfies all scheme conditionality.  Customers should be encouraged to use this option as it provides a convenient and effective method of submitting a claim.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test for these schemes takes account of the income and assets of the person and a spouse/partner, if applicable.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.</p>  <p>  Maintenance payments (whether or not it is paid in respect of a child) are assessed by first disregarding any housing costs incurred up to &euro;4,952 per annum (or &euro;95.23 per week), and then assessing the remainder at 50%.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the total value of any maintenance payments is never assessed as means for these weekly income support payments and the total income received by the family (social welfare payment and maintenance payment combined) will be higher than someone not receiving maintenance payments. </p>  <p>  Unlike schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and one parent family payment, family income supplement (FIS) is an income supplement for employees who work 19 hours or more per week.  It is an income tested scheme and account is taken, in determining entitlement, of all net income from employment, weekly welfare payments (if payable), income from any self-employment, maintenance payments and income from any other source.  A family in receipt of maintenance will always be better off than a family where maintenance is not a factor as FIS replaces just 60% of the difference between total family income and the relevant FIS threshold.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, the Department recognises that abuse of the welfare system is an ongoing reality and must be tackled through a range of measures.These measures are governed by the Department&rsquo;s <i>Compliance and</i><i>Anti-Fraud Strategy</i><i>2014 &ndash; 2018</i>.  The actions set out in the strategy are designed to prevent and detect fraud, to ensure effective oversight of schemes, to pursue prosecution of offenders and to pursue the recovery of any overpaid entitlements identified. </p><p>All Departmental staff exercise a control and compliance function in processing new applications and reviewing existing entitlements.  The systems used to support schemes are designed to detect wrongful claiming and to highlight anomalies.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate undertakes detailed examination of claims on a risk assessed and random basis.  This is supplemented by at least three fraud and error surveys of Departmental schemes annually and the findings from the surveys are used to tighten control measures around schemes, where this is found to be warranted.  The survey reports are published and subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  </p><p>In addition, the Deputies should note that my Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit, which comprises trained inspectors and Garda officers, is tasked with undertaking targeted and systematic examination of claims to tackle fraud and to work with other enforcement agencies to identify more serious breaches of the law.  </p><p>Cross-functional and targeted actions are undertaken - both internally and in joint operations with other national and international agencies - to ensure a strategic response to high risk sectors or where fraud is considered to be most prevalent.  In particular, actions are focused on sectors of the economy where there is a risk of concurrent working and claiming social welfare payments.  </p><p>Overall, my Department conducts of the order of one million reviews annually comprising customer entitlement reviews, inspections and special investigations.</p><p>The Deputies should also note that the continued roll-out of the Public Services Card has considerably reduced the potential for identity fraud and the Department has deployed identity and analytics software and other intelligence systems to reinforce its fraud prevention work.</p><p>Members of the public also play an important role in supporting these anti-fraud activities and some 17,000 reports from concerned citizens have been processed already in 2016.  </p><p>The anti-fraud actions delivered nationally are targeted in the same way in the Sligo and Leitrim areas.  As border counties, cross-border dimensions are also relevant in the compliance and ant-fraud actions undertaken by the Special Investigations Unit and other inspectors and investigatory staff.</p><p>The Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and annual updates on progress are published on the Department&rsquo;s website: .</p><p>Finally, the Deputies should note that I am looking at various control measures that I hope to roll out in 2017 to strengthen the legislative provisions to deter abuse of the social welfare system.  These include publishing the names of persons who are prosecuted for social welfare fraud and applying interest on overpayments resulting from fraud.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

DPA is administered by my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service (CWS) on an administrative basis on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality at the weekly rate of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;15.60 per child. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process recommended that the weekly rate of DPA should be increased to &euro;38.74 for adults and &euro;29.80 for children.  The rates of DPA, similar to other recommendations of the Working Group, are subject to further consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  Consideration must be taken of the overall cost of the recommendation, its impact on asylum policy, the direct provision system and the level of disposable income available to social welfare recipients and those in low income employment. </p>  <p>  It was considered that there was an urgency to provide for some level of immediate increase in respect of children and accordingly, the Government increased the child rate of DPA from &euro;9.60 to &euro;15.60 in January 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department provides Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) to people in the direct provision system which are largely made towards clothing costs, transport costs and the purchase of child related items.  ENPs are also paid to support the transition from direct provision including assistance towards rent deposits.  Some 14,900 ENPs have been paid in 2016 to people in direct provision with expenditure of &euro;1.2 million.</p>  <p>  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCFA) provides once-off assistance towards the cost of returning to school in September.  In 2016, some 430 families living in direct provision received BSCFA at a cost of &euro;92,000. </p>  <p>  Following a recommendation in the Report of the Working Group a task force was established to examine the mechanisms and supports for the transitioning of people from the Direct Provision system.  An output from this group was the ongoing roll out of an information programme and an information booklet for people transitioning from direct provision attended by representatives from relevant Departments and Agencies, including my Department.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is 0.2% of the total.  The majority of the complaints were about people&rsquo;s initial reluctance to engage with the service or in respect of individual customer experience.  All complaints have been resolved or are in the process of being resolved. </p>  <p>  Under JobPath client engagement is more frequent and more intensive.  Some people may have difficulty in adjusting to a new regime especially those who have not had any meaningful activation support for a considerable period.  JobPath tries to give people a sense of structure which they will need if they are to re-engage with the workforce</p>  <p>  Every participant on the JobPath Service is provided with a service guarantee - a baseline level of service including, frequency of engagement, personal progression planning, geographic accessibility and in-employment support.  The JobPath companies may refer jobseekers to training interventions where this assists employment prospects. </p>  <p>  The companies are subject to regular checks and inspections.  In addition, my Department has commissioned a client satisfaction survey to ensure that services are being delivered satisfactorily.  The results of this survey are expected before year end.</p>  <p>  Overall the response to JobPath has been quite positive and initial indications, in terms of employment outcomes, are also very encouraging.

This is because lone parents, on foot of the reforms, are taking up education, training or employment support programmes, which will take time for them to complete.  </p>  <p>  However, I listened carefully to the issues raised the members of the Committee as part of that debate last week.  I agreed that I would commission a report on the changes to the one parent family payment.  The report shall examine the financial and social effects of the changes taking into account poverty rates and welfare dependency of those impacted by the reforms.  </p>  <p>  My Department values quality social policy research and the contribution it makes in assisting it in terms of informing policy across its broad remit.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from the title of the report, the report does not claim to be an analysis of the lone parent reforms.  It was my Department&rsquo;s expectation that the report would provide detail on the design of specific activation programmes that work for lone parents that could assist in developing further activation measures for these customers.  The fact that it doesn&rsquo;t include that information is a lost opportunity.</p>  <p>  The research commenced in January 2015 and therefore takes no account of the final phase of the one-parent family payment reforms in July 2015, or improvements targeted at lone parents in the previous two Budgets, which resulted in lone parents benefitting more favourably than the average household.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I listened carefully to the views of One Family, and other groups, in the months before the Budget and consequently, I announced a package of measures supporting lone parents in the social welfare Budget 2017 package.  </p>  <p>  All lone parents on the one-parent family payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment will rise by &euro;20 from January, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.</p></reply>

These include the JobPath service and programmes such as Community Employment (CE).</p>  <p>  CE schemes provide part-time temporary work in their local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment, for people in receipt of a range of social welfare payments including those on a long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  However, it is important to note that CE placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.</p>  <p>  The JobPath service is provided for jobseekers only.  The period of engagement with JobPath for any individual is typically 52 weeks.  During that time, they receive intensive individual support to help them overcome barriers to employment and are also provided with a range of training and development supports, including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  During the year, if a person is placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to an additional twelve months while in employment.  Jobseekers who are engaged on JobPath are ineligible for CE for the duration of the JobPath intervention.  People who have completed their year-long engagement with JobPath may, if eligible, apply to partake in a CE Scheme after they have been assessed by one of my Department&rsquo;s case officers.</p>  <p>  In general - and JobPath is no exception - job-seekers are not allowed to participate in two employment activation supports at the same time.  Given the need to manage the allocation of places effectively, my Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another scheme.  Participation in other schemes remains an option once a person completes their JobPath engagement.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should note that a review of CE schemes has taken place.  I met with my officials to discuss the outcomes of this review and I hope to be in a position to bring a Memorandum to Government on these matters in the coming weeks.  If there are any changes to be made, consultations with stakeholders will be facilitated.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department will continue to ensure that those on low incomes and those who are more vulnerable to energy poverty are supported through the fuel allowance and the household benefits package.</p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week for 26 weeks from October to April, to over 376,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;224 million in 2016.  This payment assists these households with the higher energy costs that arise in that period.  It is a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to over 421,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs due to ill health or infirmity.  Exceptional needs payments may also be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which a person is unable to meet from his/her own resources.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s affordable energy strategy indicated that the best measure to address energy poverty is to improve the thermal efficiency of homes.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, funds energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable, making the homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to heat.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The full impact of the recovery is not yet reflected in these figures.  Ireland has returned to strong economic and employment growth.</p>  <p>  The monthly unemployment rate in October 2016 announced by the CSO was 7.7%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2015 and 2016 become available.  The Government continues to focus on activation, to help people back into the workforce.</p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Meeting this target means lifting 97,000 children out of poverty.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.</p>  <p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality.  In 2014, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland from 37.2% to 15.6%, thereby lifting over a fifth of the population out of income poverty.  Ireland is among the best performing EU Member States in this regard.  Budget 2017 increased the weekly rates of payment for working age schemes and also raised the income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment recipients.  These measures will help to tackle child poverty. </p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with Government action to sustain and develop the social welfare system, will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.</p>  <p>  However, reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality services in areas such as childcare, education and health.</p>  <p>  That is why one of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will significantly reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.</p></reply>

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life.</p>  <p>  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory, whether at full or reduced level.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years.  Provided a person satisfies all the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension contributory, the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30.</p>  <p>  Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for such periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of next year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The trust deeds and rules of a scheme differ from scheme to scheme, and as with any contractual situation, reflect the level of obligation of the parties involved.  While the Pensions Act provides a framework for the regulation and supervision of occupational pension schemes, it does not impose any requirement on an employer to fund scheme benefits or maintain an existing scheme.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 provided for a fairer and more equitable distribution of scheme assets in the event of the wind up of an underfunded scheme.  It also facilitated a greater sharing of the risk between all the beneficiaries when a scheme is underfunded, while still providing for priority protection of pension benefits.  Prior to the introduction of this Act, pensioner benefits were given priority over the benefits of active and deferred scheme members which meant a situation could arise whereby pensioners received all or almost all of the pension fund and members who had contributed but not retired received considerably less than expected.</p>  <p>  When an underfunded pension scheme is winding up (and when the employer is still solvent), the existing 100% priority given to pension benefits was changed to provide for a reduced priority for higher pensions.  It is important to note that the changes introduced in the 2013 Act still give high priority to existing pensioners in the discharge of the liabilities.  For pensioners this is:</p>  <p>  (i) 100% priority will be given to the first &euro;12,000, if the annual pension is &euro;12,000 or less;</p>  <p>  (ii) the lesser of &euro;12,000 or 90% of the annual pension if the annual pension amount is over &euro;12,000 and less than &euro;60,000;</p>  <p>  (iii) the lesser of &euro;54,00 or 80% of the annual pension if the annual pension amount is &euro;60,000 or more.</p>  <p>  After that the next priority will be to secure 50% of current and former employee&rsquo;s benefits.  Then any remaining funds will be used to secure pensioner benefits to the extent that they have not already been discharged and after that, current and former employees benefits to the extent that they have not already been discharged.</p>  <p>  This change in the order of priority when a scheme winds up redistributes funds to the current and former employees.  If the pension scheme is sufficiently funded the pensioner will get back further funds as the scheme moves through the order set out above.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to review these provisions as the changes made provided for a fairer and more equitable distribution of scheme assets in the event of the wind up of an underfunded scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As unemployed jobseekers in receipt of jobseeker payments certify that they are genuinely seeking and available for work it is expected that they will avail of these employment supports and services.  This is in line with the principle of &ldquo;rights and responsibilities&rsquo;&rsquo;; in other words unemployed people have a right to income supports and employment services from the State but also have a responsibility to engage with those services when in receipt of a payment.  Accordingly since 2011, the application of reduced rates of payment has been provided for under Social Welfare legislation.</p>  <p>  Under this Legislation a Deciding Officer may, where recipients of jobseeker payments fail, without good cause, to engage with activation services, apply a reduction to the jobseeker payment.

The normal rate of payment may be reinstated at any time, if the jobseeker reengages, as requested, with activation measures.  There are no plans to change these reduced payment rate provisions at this time.</p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 421,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016.  Applicants for household benefits aged 70 or over do not have to satisfy a means test.</p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment must also satisfy a means test.  All non-contributory recipients are accepted as satisfying the means-test.</p>  <p>  A fuel applicant and members of his/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;100.00 a week above the appropriate rate of State Pension Contributory and qualify for a payment.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  The &euro;100 a week means limit is significantly higher that the weekly fuel allowance rate of &euro;22.50 and also the combined weekly total of household benefits and fuel allowance added together (&euro;33.65).  It might be remembered that more than half of those over 66 are solely dependent upon the State pension, and so a person who has additional pension income above &euro;100 is not among the more disadvantaged people that Fuel Allowance is targeted at.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines for the Fuel Allowance Scheme are kept under review.  However, any decision to introduce a system of tapered fuel rates for cases that have means greater than the allowed &euro;100 would have cost implications, and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  Alternatively, if it was restructured on a cost-neutral basis, this would mean that pensioners on lower incomes would have their Fuel Allowance payments reduced, in order to fund payments to people with higher weekly incomes.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This included increases in the weekly rates of payment for pensioners and in the living alone allowance.  There were also increases in child benefit, fuel allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  In addition, new initiatives aimed at helping families were introduced, such as the back to work family dividend, and the paternity benefit scheme.</p>  <p>  I held a pre-Budget Forum in the run up to the recent Budget and I listened carefully to the views of a wide range of organisations representing pensioners, carers, people with disabilities and so on.  My priority in Budget 2017 was to make sure that everyone benefits from the recovery - employed, self-employed, retired people, people with disabilities, carers, those who cannot work, urban, rural, young and old.</p>  <p>  It also sets out to make work pay through reforms to the PRSI system, including a new deal for the self-employed, and it includes a number of targeted measures to assist lone parents and farmers, among others.</p>  <p>  On Budget Day, I announced the first general increase in all weekly rates of payment since 2009.  A &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment for all social welfare payments will commence from March, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of payment (including jobseekers on age-related reduced rates of payment).</p>  <p>  Approximately 1.5 million people will benefit from this increase, from pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents, maternity and paternity benefit recipients to jobseekers.</p>  <p>  I am also extending social insurance benefits for the self-employed.  From March, Class S PRSI contributors will be able to avail of Treatment Benefit, which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids and contact lenses.</p>  <p>  In addition, and more significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working without having to go through a means test.</p>  <p>  A range of Dental and Optical benefits will also be restored.  These will benefit all PRSI paying employees and the self-employed, benefitting approximately 2.5 million people.</p>  <p>  There is also a package of measures supporting lone parents in the Budget, encouraging them into the workplace and into education, and helping to reduce their childcare costs.  All lone parents on One-Parent Family Payment and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition and Jobseekers Allowance will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment.</p>  <p>  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  This will help parents, including lone parents, to return to education.</p>  <p>  The income disregards for the One Parent Family Payment and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition payment will rise by &euro;20, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  This will benefit lone parents earning more than &euro;90 per week.  For those earning &euro;110 per week or more, it will increase the combined social welfare and earnings income by up to &euro;15 per week from January 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Ireland, I announced the total reversal of the Farm Assist measures introduced during the crisis.  This is a programme which helps more than 8,000 farm families.</p>  <p>  The Social Protection Budget will benefit over 2 million people in Ireland, including the retired, workers, people with disabilities and carers, and the unemployed.</p>  <p>  The Budget also represented a significant shift in how the social insurance system interacts with self-employed contributors, with the extension of Treatment Benefits and Invalidity Pension to the self-employed next year.  I plan to continue extending cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future Budgets.</p>  <p>  The increase in the weekly rates of payment for all social welfare recipients demonstrates that everyone in Irish society can, and will, benefit under this Government from the economic recovery.</p></reply>

The use of a means test is to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  Payments from the United Kingdom (UK) are assessed as income under current legislation.  If the person applying for a Social Assistance payment has a UK pension, it is assessable, together with all other means such as savings and investments, when determining the rate of payment.</p>  <p>  There has not been any significant increase in either new applications from persons in receipt of payments from the UK, nor in requests for review of means assessed pensions and other incomes in response to the declining value of sterling.  To date c. 2% of persons in receipt of both State Pension non-contributory and a payment from the UK have requested a review of their entitlement.  There is no backlog in dealing with such requests.</p>  <p>  It is open to any person in receipt of a social assistance payment to request that his/her entitlement be reviewed if they wish.  It is important to note, however, that any such review will involve a full reassessment of all of the customer&rsquo;s means to ensure that the person continues to receive the correct payment in line with their overall entitlement and such reviews cannot of their nature just focus on the income derived from the UK.  Therefore the outcome of each review depends on the individual means and circumstances of the person.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of the UK referendum, negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU will take time.  In the interim, it is important to stress that all payments made by the Department of Social Protection to entitled persons, including those to recipients who are resident in Britain and Northern Ireland, and payments from the UK to residents in Ireland, will continue to be paid.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The average waiting time for new carer's benefit (CARB) claims at the end of October 2016 is 9.  The average waiting time for new CA applications at the end of September 2016 was 14 weeks.  The waiting time for new CA applications as at the end of October 2016 is not yet available.</p>  <p>  The Department has seen a significant reduction in CA processing from 22 weeks at the end of May to 14 weeks at the end of September and expects the processing times for both schemes to reduce further, as recently assigned staff get up to speed with the work involved in claim processing.</p>  <p>  At the end of October, there were 3,833 CA and 404 CARB applications awaiting decision.  These figures compare very favourably to the end May figures which were 6,398 and 660 respectively.</p>  <p>  The volume of claims on hands are a consequence of continued strong claim intake and the delays in processing are frequently caused by the customer failing to fully complete the claim form or failing to attach the supporting documentation that is requested on the application form.  Applications for CA by the end of September 2016 are 20% higher than in the same period in 2015 while applications for CARB are 24% higher.  This has impacted on the timely processing of applications.</p>  <p>  Reducing waiting times is a priority for the Department and we are working hard to make this happen.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by the Department in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p>  <p>  In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  Where additional staffing is deployed to a scheme, such as has happened for the carer&rsquo;s schemes, there is a time-lag involved while those staff are trained and build up expertise.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The review&rsquo;s methodology is evidence based and reflects the pressures on rental properties in each location.  Officials in my Department continue to monitor both overall availability of rental properties, which remains at historic lows, and the on-going relevance of the new limits.  Both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will jointly undertake a review of the effects of the increases on rental costs and homelessness after a 12 month period.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the ongoing supply difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits.  To date, approximately 9,300 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments.  There has been a significant reduction in these cases following the introduction of the increased rent limits.</p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), which is a key pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, will transfer responsibility for all those on rent supplement with long term housing needs to the local authorities.  It is expected that HAP will be available in all local authorities in early 2017.  HAP represents a significant reform of the system and rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short term income support.  Any recommendations to reform the administration of the rent supplement scheme have to be carefully considered in the context of this significant change in policy direction.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that I am continuing to keep the matter of rent limits and the administration of the rent supplement scheme under close review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-22a.109.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112200061#WRC03400"><p>I understand the Deputy has clarified that when he refers to a &ldquo;transition to a universal pension system&rdquo; he is referring to an introduction of a universal flat rate State pension.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to abolish either the State pension (contributory), or the State pension (non-contributory), as both are very effective in ensuring that older people have a decent standard of living.  In relation to the State pension (contributory), workers who pay PRSI over their working lives receive a benefit which allows them make further provision for their retirement without losing that benefit via a means test.</p>  <p>  The State pension (contributory) is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and may not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service for a significant period, others would have worked abroad during their working life and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g., caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  Providing a full rate pension to everyone over 66, regardless of their PRSI record or their means would be a very expensive measure, which would require significant additional funds (either through higher PRSI rates or exchequer subvention) or a reduction in the rate of the maximum pension.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  The position of gender and gaps in contribution records will be considered very carefully in developing these proposals.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020 and work is underway in my Department in that regard.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions with an ambition to achieve an overall objective of reducing poverty under the national social target for poverty reduction.</p>  <p>  NAPinclusion was recently updated for the extended period to 2017 to reflect new challenges and current policy responses to poverty.  These include a greater focus on modernising the social protection system, improving effectiveness and efficiency of social transfers and strengthening active inclusion policies to address employment and social challenges.</p>  <p>  NAPinclusion will continue to be implemented in 2017.  The Department will review the Plan during next year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target to 2020.  These review tasks will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Income supports will continue to play an important role in addressing social exclusion and income inequality during 2017.  The value of core weekly welfare payments has been maintained in recent years as social transfers have proved extremely effective in lifting people out of poverty.  The latest data for 2014 shows that Ireland was the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers, as had been the case in previous years.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 took a step forward and sought to improve the value and impact of these income supports.  During 2017, more than 840,000 people will benefit from the first increase in weekly payments for working-age adults since 2009.</p>  <p>  The measures outlined above are designed to complement the impact of continuing economic recovery in reversing the increase in poverty that took place during the recession from 2009 to 2013.  The latest available data indicate that the consistent poverty rate stabilised &ndash; indeed fell marginally &ndash; in 2014.  It is anticipated that data for 2015 and 2016, when available, will show more marked declines in this core poverty measure resulting from the sharp fall in unemployment since 2014.  Unemployment is also forecast to fall further next year.</p></reply>

The Authority provides a wide range of information and guidance to help and support trustees to comply with their regulatory obligations as set out under legislation.  The Authority, in consultation with my Department, is continually assessing governance issues and making improvements in order to protect the members of pension schemes.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, the Authority outlined plans for improved pension scheme governance in their Statement of Strategy 2016-2020.  This Statement of Strategy sets out the vision, mission, values and the strategic objectives and high level strategies that will underpin the Authority&rsquo;s work programme for the next 5 years.  The Strategy will be reviewed mid-term to assess whether it continues to be appropriate to guide the Authority&rsquo;s activities or whether the environmental and operational context has altered to such an extent that a new or revised Strategy is required.</p>  <p>  Oversight of the executive of the Pensions Authority is provided by a three person board.  This consists of the following:</p>  <p>  - Mr David Begg as Authority chair.</p>  <p>  - Ms Ann Nolan, Second Secretary General in the Department of Finance, who represents the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  - Ms Anne Vaughan, Deputy Secretary General in the Department of Social Protection, who represents the Minister for Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The role of the Pensions Authority is to promote and support compliance with the Pensions Act and to address any non-compliance it encounters.  It is not, however, responsible for running pension schemes and PRSAs.  Rather, the responsibility for managing pension schemes and PRSAs and for making decisions relevant to their operation and management rests with the trustees, the PRSA providers and employers.  The Authority is responsible for ensuring those managing and providing services to pension schemes and PRSAs operate in compliance with the requirements of the Pensions Act.</p>  <p>  If it is considered that benefits due are not being paid in accordance with the rules of a pension scheme, the person concerned can invoke the dispute resolution procedures which the scheme is obliged to operate and if they are still dissatisfied, they can bring the complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman.  The Pensions Authority also comes under the remit of the Ombudsman (not the Pensions Ombudsman), who deals with customers who feel they may have been unfairly treated by public bodies.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the Authority continued its robust compliance activities by opening 45 new investigations, closing 66, and referring 18 cases for prosecution.  The Authority held 60 compliance meetings with stakeholders.  225 occupational pension schemes were selected for audit and 37 prosecution cases, most of which related to the construction sector, were concluded.  The increase in prosecutions resulting from whistle-blowers&rsquo; reports highlights the increased awareness of the Authority as an avenue for citizens to raise their concerns.  The Authority&rsquo;s investigations of Registered Administrators found an improvement in compliance standards since 2010 and this reflects the positive impact of the Authority&rsquo;s compliance work.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Pensions Authority, together with the Department, is currently working on proposals for reform and simplification of pensions, the purpose of which is to impose higher standards for all occupational schemes.  Standards in relation to pension schemes will also be further enhanced by the transposition of the new IORPS II Directive within the next two years.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 15.1% (30,500) in October 2016 (as estimated by CSO), compared to 15.9% (32,400) in September 2016 and a peak of over 31.1% (70,500) in 2012.</p>  <p>  Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate young unemployed people to find and sustain employment.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).</p>  <p>  The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015.  The wage subsidy JobsPlus Youth, valued at &euro;7,500, is also available to employers who hire young jobseekers under 25 who were previously at least four months unemployed (JobsPlus is otherwise available to jobseekers over 25 who are at least 12 months unemployed).</p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p></reply>

One of these actions is a commitment to develop a programme to support more people to get back to work if they have an illness or disability.</p>  <p>  The commitment envisaged that the programme is being led by the Departments of Health and Social Protection, working together and with other stakeholders.  These Departments have identified &ldquo;Healthy You: Early Intervention&rdquo; as the working title of the programme to reflect widespread evidence that early intervention in a person&rsquo;s illness or health condition through a range of services and supports can lead to positive health, employment and income results overall.  Clearly, there will be cases where a return to work is neither desirable nor appropriate, but for other cases, the intention will be to ensure that both the healthcare and the income support systems, together with appropriate care supports from employers and others, increase the chances of a successful recovery.</p>  <p>  As an initial step towards the development of this programme, a stakeholder forum is being organised to obtain a range of views about the scope of the programme as well as identifying issues around its design and operation.  Subsequently, the feedback derived from this session will assist the work of the interdepartmental group set up to progress this proposal.</p>  <p>  I would like to reassure the Deputy that any such proposals will be in line with the wealth of evidence which shows that generally employment is good for one&rsquo;s mental and physical health and wellbeing and, conversely, that unemployment can be damaging.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, and who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under this scheme.  Under the scheme, entitlement is calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.</p><p>Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6 April 1988.  These contributions provide<font color="#004080"> </font>cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows/widowers pension (contributory).  A person must have paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year prior to reaching age 66,<font color="#004080"> </font>and all self-employment contributions payable must have been<font color="#0000FF"> </font>paid in full.</p><p>There is also a State pension (contributory) half-rate pension for self-employed people.  The legislation providing for this partial pension came into effect from 9 April 1999 to provide a basic payment for groups who would not otherwise qualify for a contributory social welfare pension, and who did not satisfy the means test for the State pension (non-contributory).  In this case, the measure was designed to benefit self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory self-employed social insurance was introduced in 1988, who had not paid other contributions (such as voluntary contributions, or other contributions while in employment), and who could not therefore satisfy the condition of having entered insurance 10 years before pension age.  The pension was seen as a reasonable response to the position of the self-employed who were in their late 50s when Class S contributions were introduced, and I believe most would agree that it represents good value for the contributions made.</p><p>EU Regulations provide for the inclusion of social insurance periods a person has incurred in another Member State(s), in a combined Irish/EU record, for the purposes of state pension contributory (SPC) eligibility.  Taking the combined record into account, and subject to their satisfaction of the standard SPC eligibility conditions set out in domestic legislation, a claimant may qualify for a reduced-rate &lsquo;pro-rata&rsquo; EU state pension (contributory) under EU Regulations.  These arrangements apply to all countries covered by EU legislation, including the EEA countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.  All such applications are first assessed under Irish legislation, on the basis of the claimant&rsquo;s Irish contributions record only, then separately under EU legislation, using the pro-rata calculation method.  If the eligibility conditions are satisfied, the most financially beneficial pension entitlement is awarded.</p><p>There are also a series of Social Security Agreements which apply to other countries not covered by EU regulations.  These agreements protect the pension entitlements of Irish people who go to work in these countries and they protect workers from those countries who work in Ireland.  They allow periods of Irish social insurance and, depending on the legislation in the other country, periods of residence/contributions which are completed in the second country, to be taken into account so that the worker may have his/her entitlement to a pension determined.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme in 1994, there was no provision for the recognition of periods of homemaking.  This scheme introduced such recognition of periods going forward from that date as the costs for backdating it would have been very considerable.  I am advised that if the Homemakers scheme was to be backdated to all dates prior to 1994, for payments from January 2017, the net cost to the Exchequer could be expected to amount to approximately &euro;290 million in 2017, and this annual cost would rise at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions.</p><p>Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), which amounts to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p><p>It is worth noting that the most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found the self-employed and women achieve very good value for money from the fund.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.  This downward trend in overall appeal processing times has continued to date in 2016 to 24.3 weeks for an oral hearing and 17.4 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>Notwithstanding these improvements, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times will continue to be a priority for her office and will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  However, the system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.</p><p>Appellants are advised of their right to request an oral hearing when their appeal is registered as an information leaflet (SW56) issues with the appeal acknowledgment.  This information leaflet is also available on the appeals office website &ndash; .</p><p>I am advised that where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing, for example where the appeal question relates to contribution conditions or means and the underlying means or PRSI contribution figures are not disputed.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware from figures reported in the Chief Appeals Officer&rsquo;s Annual Report that 36.4 per cent of appeals determined by Appeals Officers in 2015 involved an oral hearing &ndash; the equivalent figure in 2014 was 31.2 per cent.

FIS is designed to tackle child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  There are over 56,000 families with over 124,000 children in receipt of FIS.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;410 million.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of weekly means tested social assistance payments, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, one-parent family payment and disability allowance, Social Welfare legislation provides that any FIS payments to the relevant family are not assessable as means.   </p>  <p>  In relation to other Government Departments, the types of income, which are taken into account for assessing means for their purposes is a matter in the first instance for those Departments. </p>  <p>  However, I am advised by the Department of Health that income from FIS is not taken into account in the assessment for a medical card or GP card.</p>  <p>  The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of local authorities as an integral part of their housing management functions, subject to broad principles laid down by the Department of Housing, Community and Local Government. </p>  <p>  I have been advised that considerable work has been carried out by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in developing a draft framework for a harmonisation of the approach to be taken by local authorities in regard to various aspects of rent schemes.  The proposals are currently being reviewed in light of the broader commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to review the disparate systems of differential rent in place across local authorities.

In doing so, the survey explored the work experience and ambitions of disability allowance (DA) recipients.  The survey found that 13% of DA recipients are currently working (part-time or full-time) while 31% had never worked.  56% of respondents stated they had previously worked (full-time or part-time) but were not currently working.  The survey also asked those who are not currently working to give an indication of their employment ambitions given the right supports.  Of those who completed this question, 35% expressed an interest in working part time, while 8% expressed an interest in full time employment.</p>  <p>  The survey, undertaken as part of my Department&rsquo;s commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), also explores disability allowance recipients&rsquo; experience and ambitions in four key areas: education level and ambitions; work experience and ambitions; supports which would be helpful to achieve employment ambitions and barriers to achieving employment ambitions.  In addition, the survey explores recipients&rsquo; self-declared health status.  The survey will provide considerable assistance to my Department and the Comprehensive Employment strategy overall in the management and development of supports and services to help persons with disabilities find and maintain employment where this is appropriate and voluntary.</p>  <p>  In addition to the DA payment, my department manages a number of specific supports and measures to support people with disabilities in moving into employment.  These include the wage subsidy scheme, which is targeted at employers to encourage employment of people with disabilities and the EmployAbility service, which supports people with disabilities who wish to work through the provision of a dedicated job coach.  The department also provides a range of grants under the reasonable accommodation fund, which comprises employment supports to assist people with disabilities to access and progress in employment.</p>  <p>  Moreover, people with a disability in receipt of social welfare income supports who work can retain a portion of their payment.  For example, if a person&rsquo;s doctor recommends that the work is of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature, recipients of DA can work and earn &euro;120 per week without affecting the rate of DA being paid, while if the weekly earnings are between &euro;120 and &euro;350, fifty per cent of the earnings will be disregarded in the DA means test.  The results from the DA survey show that some 10% of recipients avail of this provision. </p>  <p>  For people who are in receipt of invalidity pension or who have been in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of six months, the partial capacity benefit scheme provides an opportunity for persons to take up employment and continue to receive an ongoing portion of their weekly social welfare payment, including any increase being paid in respect of a qualified adult or qualified children. </p>  <p>  Under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) for people with disabilities, the Department is progressively rolling out its full Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  People with disabilities who present at INTREO service offices will be offered an interview by a case officer who will agree suitable personal progression plan with the individual and record the action plan for the person on the case management system.  In addition, relevant officers in INTREO Centres have received training, to enable them to interact effectively with people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In addition, an interdepartmental group was established under the CES to review and make recommendations on making work pay for people with disabilities.  The research afforded by the DA Survey formed an important input into the work of this group and to the formulation of strategy generally in this area. </p>  <p>  The interdepartmental working group is currently completing its examination of this complex area and is due to present its report to Government before the end of the year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-22a.147.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112200062#WRD01100"><p>The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not involve the award of credits.</p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of next year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 commenced its second stage reading in the D&aacute;il on 5 October.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on drawing up the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department's website.  The Bill is at the final stages of drafting and while I am not in a position to give an exact date, I expect to publish the Bill very shortly so as to facilitate early ratification of the Convention.</p></reply>

The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements) is currently underway.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-22a.175.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112200062#WRD03000"><p>I can inform the Deputy that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Acts 2001- 2015 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole responsibility.  I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in decisions in this regard.  Under the valuation legislation, the Commissioner has overall responsibility for the maintenance of valuation lists of all commercial properties in the State which are used by Local Authorities in the calculation of rates due from individual ratepayers.  This is done by using two statutory valuation processes known as "revaluation" and "revision". </p>  <p>  Firstly, revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date.  After the first revaluation of a Local Authority area is completed, revaluation is then scheduled to take place every five to ten years to reflect changes in economic circumstances since the last revaluation took place.  Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations.  It is accepted that the valuation element of the rating system should have both a comprehensive revaluation and revision programme running in tandem.</p>  <p>  The national revaluation programme currently underway is the first general revaluation of all commercial property in the state since the middle of the 19th century and has priority status in the work of the Valuation Office.  It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 146,000 commercial rateable properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every Local Authority area onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations provided for in the legislation represents a sea-change for the valuation system.  As part of the national revaluation programme, the revaluation of all commercial properties in the Limerick City and County rating authority area was completed in December 2014 when certificates of valuation were issued to over 6,700 commercial and industrial ratepayers.  The new valuations took effect from 1 January 2015 and have formed the basis for commercial rates since then. </p>  <p>  While the revaluation work has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and, during 2015, some 5,438 applications for revision were processed nationwide.  Also, any backlog of revision work is cleared during the revaluation of a local authority area.  As already mentioned, revision of valuation is the process by which the valuation lists are maintained between revaluations and reflects changes to property of a structural nature and the addition to the valuation lists of new properties. </p>  <p>  The number of applications for revision of valuation in respect of the Limerick City and County rating authority area which are currently on hands and awaiting assignment to valuers in the Valuation Office is 198, of which 105 have been received within the last 6-month period.  In addition, there are 35 cases currently being actively processed to completion.  I am informed that all of the Limerick revision applications awaiting assignment to valuers relate to properties already on the valuation list and consist of properties that have been demolished, sub-divided, amalgamated or extended and would also include some applications for removal on the basis of exemption from rates.  I am also informed that none of the applications awaiting assignment relate to newly built properties. </p>  <p>  It has been a priority for the Valuation Office to enter into collaborative arrangements with all Local Authorities including the Limerick City and County Council, to ensure that an efficient and effective revision programme can be conducted on an ongoing basis.  To this effect, the Commissioner has implemented a number of initiatives to enhance the capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver a high-quality and timely revision service.  To that end, several improvements have already been put in place in recent times.  For example, the Office has recently carried out a revision pilot project involving four local authorities which was designed to improve data exchange with local authorities in general.  Following the conclusion of the pilot project, this approach is now being rolled out to all local authorities and online services have been enhanced to facilitate more effective data exchanges between those bodies and the Valuation Office.  </p>  <p>  The Valuation Office recently commissioned a review of its revaluation and revision processes.  That review made a number of recommendations in line with best international practice based on methodologies and processes for handling statutory valuation work in other jurisdictions.  These recommendations will now form the basis of an implementation plan being put in place by the Valuation Office.  The review also proposed establishing a separate, permanently resourced, Revision Unit responsible for the processing of revision work and the ongoing assessment of properties falling under this category.  Following the receipt of a business case by the Valuation Office seeking the provision of additional funding to allow for the establishment of a dedicated resource to deal specifically with the ongoing revision programme, I was pleased to be in a position to announce as part of the recent budgetary provisions, the allocation of an additional &euro;750,000 to the Valuation Office during 2017 for this purpose.  This development, which will involve the appointment of a number of additional staff, in tandem with the rollout of improved online facilities and enhanced processes and procedures, is specifically intended to address backlogs in conducting revision assessments and to enable the Valuation Office to provide timely and high quality revision services to all Local Authorities including Limerick City and County Council and to ratepayers into the future.</p></reply>

It allows the State to provide such accommodation in a manner that facilitates resources being used in the most economic means possible while also delivering services (such as education and health) directly to those within the system.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the protection process including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers provides a template for the development and improvement of a wide range of services being delivered to those seeking international protection. </p>  <p>  One of the key recommendations of the Report was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process.  The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure.  My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act which responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and by extension in State provided accommodation.  </p>  <p>  On this particular point, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process. </p>  <p>  A transition Task Force was established in 2015 and put in place important supports to facilitate people with status moving into and integrating with the community.  The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months.</p>  <p>  Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in State provided accommodation while their application is being processed is also being made.  In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago.  Prescription fees for all those in receipt of the Direct Provision allowance, including children, have also been waived.  The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016/2017.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, which is responsible for the management and administration of accommodation and ancillary services to protection applicants in State provided accommodation, is actively progressing the implementation of other recommendations in the Report around access to cooking facilities and the increase in living space for those who avail of State provided accommodation.  Pilot projects are being established and undertaken in a number of centres to realise these objectives and ensuring that those residing in the State provided accommodation continue to be treated with respect and dignity.</p>  <p>  RIA are also working on the development of standards for the provision and maintenance of services in accommodation centres, enhancing the complaints mechanisms for residents of those centres and the provision of ongoing diversity and equality training and awareness programmes across all centres.</p></reply>

As access to statutory services for protection applicants is mainstreamed, residents of RIA accommodation centres engage with these services in the same way as Irish citizens and there is no requirement therefore for a contract to underpin service provision.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Section 19 of the Refugee Act of 1996 (as amended) requires the State to take all practical steps to ensure that the identity of protection applicants is kept confidential. Bearing this in mind, some of the details requested by the Deputy can be found below.  </p>  <p>  The official address of the Athlone Accommodation centre is Lissywollen, Ballymahon Road, Athlone, Co. Westmeath.  </p>  <p>  Campbell Catering Ltd, t/a Aramark Ireland currently hold the contract for the management of the centre.  There are currently 185 persons residing there comprising 46 children and 139 adults.  </p>  <p>  As previously outlined, access to primary and post primary education for children of protection applicants residing in State provided accommodation is mainstreamed.  Therefore, these children have the same access to primary and post primary education as the wider community and parents apply for schools of their choice in the same manner as residents in the wider community.  Transport to schools is arranged for school going residents via the school bus scheme provided by Bus Eireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  There is a rigorous inspection system in place in which each centre is inspected three times a year, twice by RIA staff and once by an independent inspection company, QTS Limited.  In addition, to ensure transparency in relation to standards in centres, all completed inspection reports of centres undertaken since 1 October 2013 are published on the RIA website - www.ria.gov.ie.  Centres are also subject to inspection by various other State agencies including, for example, Environmental Health Officers.</p>  <p>  Extensive and detailed information on the amount paid by my Department to each company contracted to provide accommodation every year up to and including 2013 can be found on the RIA website under the 'Contract Values 2000 - 2013 inclusive (January 2016)' section of the website.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not appropriate to provide values for current contracts entered into by my Department.  Negotiations take place with a number of commercial entities on an ongoing basis with a clear focus on achieving the best value for money in respect of each contract.  It is not in the interests of yielding best value for the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are made available to other commercial bodies who are, or may be in the future, engaged in these negotiations.</p>  <p>  Procedures are in place in each centre, including the accommodation centre in Athlone, to facilitate the residents in receiving visitors.  These procedures vary by centre to accommodate local arrangements including the protection and safety of all residents.</p></reply>

However, I can say that recent statistical analysis showed that there were in the region of 500 persons with some form of status in the process of transiting to accommodation in the community.  This number fluctuates based on the numbers of status grants and the movement of such persons into private accommodation over time.  The Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), its centre managers, the Community Welfare Service (by way of provision of Rent Allowance), Citizens Information and those City and County Councils operating the Housing Assistance Payments link with such persons in accessing the appropriate supports and services, including in respect of sourcing and securing private accommodation.</p>  <p>  Following on from the McMahon Working Group Report, the Department of Justice and Equality developed a guide to independent living for persons with status to provide practical assistance for them.  The guide is available in all centres and has been published on the RIA website (www.ria.gov.ie) in a number of different languages.  This was published in parallel with information sessions coordinated by the Citizens Information Bureau in accommodation centres which gave an opportunity for such persons to seek assistance and clarification on the services provided.</p>  <p>  Once some form of status is granted, residents cease to be ordinarily entitled to the accommodation supports provided through RIA.  Notwithstanding this fact, RIA have always continued to provide such persons with continued accommodation until they secure their own private accommodation.  RIA are particularly mindful of the reality of the housing situation in the State and the pressures on the Community Welfare Service in respect of Rent Supplement or the City and County Councils in respect of Housing Assistance Payments and Housing Lists.  That said, the provision of housing for persons coming out of the protection process has been incorporated in the recently published Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

In this capacity, the Law Society is not, as such, a directly State-funded organisation and levies fees on its own membership in support of its functions.  Indeed, details of its accounts are published in its annual Reports and Consolidated Financial Statements which are publicly available including on the Society's own website, www.lawsociety.ie.</p>  <p>  At the same time, and for the sake of completeness, the Deputy will also wish to be aware that the Law Society does receive some indirect public funding support as a participating partner in the Skillnets and Finuas Network programmes which have their own dedicated websites and annual reporting cycles.  I understand that these programmes are co-funded through the National Training Fund operated under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Skillnets initiative, established in 1999 (www.skillnets.ie), actively supports and works with business sectors in Ireland to keep them competitive and to create new jobs through training and up-skilling, including work activation and placement in areas of employment potential.  The Finuas Network (www.finuas.ie), in operation since 2009, aims to maintain Ireland's top position in the international financial services sector and in its provision of ancillary legal and other services and to support their continued competitiveness and growth.</p></reply>

Cases can be and are adjourned, on occasions, from sitting to sitting and such adjournments are, in general, at the request of legal practitioners representing one or both parties.

On Budget day I announced that the Government has approved my proposal that by 2021 the overall Garda workforce should comprise a total of 21,000 personnel; to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure of civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  The Garda Inspectorate, in its 2015 report &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot; has estimated that there may be up to 1,250 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years.  With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested to identify posts suitable for redeployment by the end of the year and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.</p><p>The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in Budget 2017 will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.  These appointments will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years. </p><p>I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of civilians in each Garda Division on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.  Apart from the posts listed below, there are more than another 1,000 civilian staff undertaking other administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as civilianisation enables the establishment or expansion of some vital services which are wholly or largely provided by civilian staff &ndash; including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Garda Information Service Centre, the Garda Central Vetting Unit, the Fixed Charge Processing Office, and the civilianisation of the call taking function in the Command and Control Centre.  </p><p><b>CIVILIAN STRENGTH OCTOBER 2016</b><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th><div>TOTAL</div></th></tr><tr><td>DMR South Central</td><td><div>28</div></td></tr><tr><td>DMR North Central</td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH</td><td><div>43</div></td></tr><tr><td>DMR EAST</td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>DMR SOUTH</td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td>DMR WEST</td><td><div>48</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>28</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>28</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td><div>36</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td><div>30</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td><div>58</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td><div>28</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td><div>24</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>51</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td><div>31</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td><div>37</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>31</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>46</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td><div>27</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>27</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>29</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>907</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda Reserves by Garda Division on 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the following table.</p><p>The strength of the Reserve has fallen in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013 to 756 currently.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly over 160 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last two years. </p><p>Now that the recruitment process for trainee Garda&iacute; is bedded down and a continuous pipeline of successful applicants is in place to ensure ongoing recruitment, there is the capacity in the system to commence work on the development of multi-annual plan to increase the Reserve numbers to 2,000 over the next five years in line the commitment in the Programme for Government.  Achieving this will require in the order of 300 new Reserves to be recruited and trained annually.  This will be significant undertaking and it is important that the processes around it are efficient and effective as possible.  With this in mind the Commissioner is examining how the recruitment should be done - centrally as has been the case to date or more locally -  and also how the training can best be delivered.  The expectation at this stage is that we will see new reserves entering An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na mid next year.</p><p>The Garda Reserve performs policing duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;.  The role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas.  Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;.  In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.  </p><p>In the context of the planned expansion of the Reserve it is important that consideration is given to optimising its use.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda Reserve Management Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve including whether additional powers should be conferred on Reserve members.  </p><p><b>Reserve Garda&iacute; by Garda Division

The system is being introduced in order to ensure a balance between mobility and security concerns for the legal entry into the Schengen area for persons who travel visa free. </p>  <p>  The ETIAS will be an automated IT system which facilitates the processing of applications from the persons concerned travelling to the Schengen Area.  It will gather information on travellers to allow for advance immigration and security checks.  The ETIAS will apply to all visa-exempt third country nationals including airport transit passengers and family members of a Union citizen who do not hold a residence permit.  The ETIAS does not apply to EU citizens which, of course, includes Irish nationals.  In addition, ETIAS will not apply to recognised refugees or stateless persons.  Where applicable, carriers will have to check that their passengers have a valid ETIAS travel authorisation before allowing them to board.</p>  <p>  Initial discussion of the proposed Regulation establishing the ETIAS took place at the JHA Council on 18th November, 2016 with the Commission presenting an outline of the proposal.  This proposal builds upon the measures in the Schengen acquis that concern the crossing of borders and in which Ireland (and the UK) do not participate.  Therefore, Ireland are not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and are not bound by it or subject to its application.</p>  <p>  It is expected that ETIAS will be operational by 2020.  In relation to the implications, if any, of this proposal in the context of BREXIT, it would be premature to speculate on this specific issue in advance of the negotiation process that will take place following the UK's formal notification that it intends to leave the EU.  The matter will be kept under review in that context.</p></reply>

The intention to backdate this tax incentive to this date was announced at that time with a view to avoiding any potential interruption in house sales, by purchasers who may otherwise have deferred purchases, pending the commencement of the incentive.</p>  <p>  It is not unusual for legislative changes to the tax code to come into effect on dates other than the 1st of January.  This can occur when for example, State Aid approval is received from the European Commission, or to commence a change with immediate effect, such as certain Budget day changes.  In this case, the date of the commencement was the date when individuals first would have become aware that the Government would be bringing forward an incentive, and it could have affected purchasing decisions.</p></reply>

It is also important to recall that the announcements made by a number of Member States including Germany, Italy, France and Spain in the lead up to the original agreement on EFSI were to do with co-financing through their National Promotional Banks (NPBs).  Making such contributions to the overall EFSI fund is not ruled out either directly or through a co-funding programme through our own NPB, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  However, in the context of very constrained public finances and in the near aftermath of exiting the EU/IMF programme, such contributions would require strong justification in terms of supporting projects that would benefit Ireland directly. </p>  <p>  EFSI provides an important additional funding mechanism to support investment in the pursuit of employment and growth.  It must be considered alongside the other suite of investment mechanisms including the European Investment Bank's normal lending activities.  Thankfully in the case of the public sector, the State's capital investment programme is sufficiently funded via the state's borrowings through the NTMA, while other mechanisms such as PPPs and off-balance sheet vehicles are also additional potential options for funding investment. </p>  <p>  Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP companies and I am pleased that the primary health care centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  It should be remembered that each EFSI loan entered into by the State would pre-commit funding for the repayment of such loans, and would have to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.  This has been a significant limiting factor on the potential for EFSI funded public sector projects to date.</p></reply>

Activate's pipeline for new home construction funding is strong.  The consistent feedback from developers and builders is that this specialist form of residential development lending is needed to help kick start the housing market. </p>  <p>  It is important to appreciate that whilst ISIF has provided financing to Activate, it does not hold equity in nor is it involved in the management of the entity.  Activate is itself a private commercial entity and ISIF is precluded from disclosing any third-party commercially sensitive information.  Accordingly, as drawdown profiles and the value and pricing of specific loans are commercially sensitive to Activate, it is not possible to disclose this information.  Doing so might actually compromise the value of ISIF's investment in Activate.  However, I  can confirm that the Activate base lending rate ranges from circa 6% to 10%, depending on the extent of leverage advanced and the risk characteristics of each specific project.  As would be expected for projects of this nature, there is participation in equity upside if projects are successful so that the fund, and by extension taxpayers, share in any gains alongside the project promoter. </p></reply>

Both hairdressing and printed matter are specifically provided for in Annex III of the VAT Directive thus allowing for a reduced VAT rate to apply to them. </p>  <p>  However, other tourist activities such as tour guide services and the short-term hire of cars, boat, caravans and mobile homes remain liable to VAT at the 13.5%, as the provisions of the EU VAT Directive did not allow for a 9% VAT rate to apply to them.</p></reply>

Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe.  A competitive corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.  Ireland's corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting FDI to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.  This evidence underpins the Government's continued commitment to the 12.5% rate.</p></reply>

While hedging can provide some measure of relief and provide SMEs with time to adapt to this change, it is not possible to fully mitigate the long-term impact of currency devaluation through hedging.</p>  <p>  State backed, low cost credit can assist SMEs to restructure their cost bases and re-price their products and services so they can continue trading with the UK in the weaker Sterling environment.  In this context, it is encouraging to note that SMEs can access lower cost, flexible finance from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  To the end of June 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;347 million to 8,619 SMEs. </p>  <p>  My Department will, of course, continue to monitor fluctuations in the exchange rate and ensure that the wide range of State supports currently available are tailored to ensure that they provide effective support to SMEs affected by challenges arising from the UK referendum on membership of the European Union.</p>  <p>  However, it would not be economically or fiscally sustainable for the State to subsidise an artificially set exchange rate.  Indeed, EU State Aid Regulations prohibit countries from directly subsidising exchange rates and hedging products.  It is important to note that there are multiple financial providers active in the Irish market that can provide a comprehensive and competitive range of hedging and foreign exchange products to SMEs who require them.  Indeed, as the deputy points out in the information supplied with his question, there are new entrants to the Irish market that are providing currency solutions for Irish businesses.</p></reply>

Gable was principally selling commercial insurance policies and surety bonds in a number of European countries, including Ireland, on a freedom of services basis. </p>  <p>  Gable entered into administration in October 2016, with PricewaterhouseCoopers AG (PwC) appointed as Special Administrator by the FMA.  Subsequently, following an extraordinary shareholders meeting on 11 November, the FMA were informed that no capital injection will be made to Gable by its parent company.  Consequently, on 17 November the Special Administrator filed an application with the competent Liechtenstein court, seeking an order that Gable is wound-up.  The FMA have stated that the Liechtenstein Court has opened winding-up proceedings and a liquidator has been appointed as of 18 November 2016. </p>  <p>  In regard to Gable customers in Ireland to which the Deputy refers, the Central Bank are advising that Gable policyholders immediately contact their insurance broker to establish their legal position, including the need to seek alternative insurance cover.  The Central Bank state that the urgency stems from the fact that any claim made by policyholders who hold active policies with Gable, may not be fully covered due to the indebtedness of Gable and the pending winding-up order.  I understand that the Central Bank has written to the relevant brokers in this regard.</p>  <p>  Further information is available from the FMA at www.fma-li.li/en/.  The Liquidator may be contacted at the following email address gable@bwb.li </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Gable passported into Ireland under a key principle of the European Union, that of the freedom to provide services from one Member State throughout the European Union.  This principle is an important one and is also availed of by a number of  insurance firms established in Ireland  in order to conduct business into other EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Underpinning the ability to conduct business whether in a company's home territory or elsewhere in the EU under the freedom to provide services is the Solvency II Directive which came into force from 1 January 2016.  Solvency II is a revision of EU insurance and reinsurance law designed to modernise supervision, deepen market integration and increase the competitiveness of European insurers.  Prudential home state insurance supervision has been in place for decades based on the principle of mutual recognition, and an understanding that all supervisory authorities in the European Union supervise at a similarly high level.  However,  in reality, there was no uniform standard of supervision in the EU, meaning that there was always the possibility for companies to exploit the regulatory/supervision regimes to their own advantage.  One of the main purposes of Solvency II therefore is to try and ensure a harmonised approach to supervision across the EU going forward. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated to me that it  continues to work closely with relevant foreign National Competent Authorities and EIOPA (the European insurance supervisory authority), which has identified as one of its key strategic objectives 'to improve the quality, efficiency and consistency of the supervision of EU insurers and occupational pensions.'  It has informed me that it fully supports EIOPA's work in this regard and has actively engaged with EIOPA in its revision of the General Protocol which will enhance the exchange of information between supervisory authorities.</p>  <p>  In the area of business conduct, the Central Bank has put in place a consumer protection framework to protect the interests of consumers in dealing with insurers.  The consumer protection framework also applies to European insurers selling in Ireland on a freedom of establishment basis or a freedom of services basis.  The consumer protection framework includes codes and regulations that set out standards for firms when dealing with consumers, including when selling insurance policies, handling claims and renewing policies as well as the provision of information and dealing with complaints.  This includes the provisions contained in the Consumer Protection Code 2012.</p></reply>

In 2016 the home carer tax credit was increased to &euro;1,000 and I announced in the recent Budget that the credit will increase to &euro;1,100 with effect from January 2017.</p><p>The Home Carer credit may still be claimed where the home carer has a certain amount of income in his or her own right.  The full tax credit is due if the Home Carer's income is less than a threshold amount.  This threshold was increased to &euro;7,200 with effect from 2016, from a lower limit of &euro;5,080 which applied in prior years including 2014.  Where the home carer's income exceeds the threshold, the credit is withdrawn on a tapered basis, with &euro;1 of the credit being withdrawn for each additional &euro;2 earned by the home carer.</p><p>Therefore, in 2014 and 2015, a portion of the home-carer credit was due where the home carer's income was between &euro;5,080 and &euro;6,700.  For example: In 2014 if the home carer had income of &euro;6,000, the home carer tax credit due would have been &euro;350.  This is calculated by reducing the full credit of &euro;810 by one-half of the income earned in excess of the &euro;5,080 threshold: i.e. &euro;6,000 - &euro;5,080 = &euro;900 / 2 = &euro;460. &euro;810 - &euro;460 = &euro;350 credit due.</p><p>For 2016, as a result of the increased credit of &euro;1,000 and the higher income threshold of &euro;7,200, a portion of the home-carer credit is due where the home carer's income is between &euro;7,200 and &euro;9,200.  In 2017 a portion of the home-carer credit of &euro;1,100 will be due where the home carer's income is between &euro;7,200 and &euro;9,400.</p><p>The following table contains a breakdown for the figures for 2014.  The numbers provided represent income earners who were in a position to absorb at least some of the home carer tax credit and thereby give rise to an Exchequer cost.  They do not include the number of potential claimants whose entitlement to other tax credits was sufficient to reduce their tax liability to nil without reference to the home carer tax credit.  The figures are rounded and adjusted to take account of late filers.  A married couple or civil partners who have elected or have been deemed to have elected for joint assessment are counted as one tax unit.<table><tr><th>Bailiwick</th><th>Home Carers Credit Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1,100</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>3,700</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>2,800</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1,400</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,400</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1,700</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1,900</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>19,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin County</td><td>11,500</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>2,900</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>5,300</td></tr><tr><td>Other/Foreign</td><td>1,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The loan is repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the home after the borrower permanently moves out or dies.  Until then, interest payments on the loan are rolled up on top of the initial loan amount so the repayable amount grows over time as interest is added to the balance.  Both of these are niche products, usually provided to those aged 60 or older.</p><p>The Central Bank has advised that, since February 2008, it is responsible for the authorisation and supervision of Home Reversion Firms.  No specific authorisation requirements arise in relation to &quot;lifetime mortgage&quot; products and firms which are authorised to provide mortgage credit generally in the State may provide &quot;lifetime mortgages&quot; to borrowers.  Details of Home Reversion Firms currently authorised in the State and firms authorised to provide credit in the State can be accessed via the Registers section of the Central Bank's website.</p><p>The Central Bank has also advised that the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (CPC) contains a number of requirements for regulated entities regarding the provision of information to personal consumers relating to &quot;lifetime mortgages&quot; and &quot;home reversion agreements&quot;.  The CPC also requires that personal consumers are made aware of the importance of seeking independent legal advice.</p><p>Prior to a &quot;lifetime mortgage&quot; being taken out, the CPC provides that the personal consumer must be informed of:</p><p>- the circumstances in which the loan will have to be repaid</p><p>- details of the interest rate that will be charged </p><p>- an explanation of the impact of the rolling up of the interest over the duration of the loan</p><p>- an indication of the amount required to repay the loan at maturity</p><p>- the effect on an existing mortgage, if any; and</p><p>- an indication of the likely early redemption costs which would be incurred if the loan was redeemed on the third and fifth anniversary of the loan and at five yearly intervals thereafter.</p><p>Prior to a &quot;home reversion agreement&quot; being taken out, the CPC also provides that the personal consumer must be informed of:</p><p>- the circumstances in which the agreement comes to an end;</p><p>- the effect on the existing mortgage, if any; and</p><p>- in the case of a variable-share contract, an indication of the potential change in the breakdown of the ownership of the property between that held by the home reversion company and the personal consumer, over the duration of the agreement.</p><p>In addition to the above, certain warning statements must be provided on advertisements, application forms, the regulated entities website and other documents related to &quot;lifetime mortgages&quot; or &quot;home reversion agreements&quot;.  For &quot;lifetime mortgages&quot;, the personal consumer must be warned that while no interest is payable during the period of the mortgage, the interest is compounded on an annual basis and is payable in full in circumstances such as death, permanent vacation of or sale of the property.  For &quot;home reversion agreements&quot;, personal consumers must be warned that the money they receive may be much less than the actual market value of the share in their home.  For both &quot;lifetime mortgages&quot; and &quot;home reversion agreements&quot;, personal consumers must be warned that purchasing such a product may negatively impact on their ability to fund future needs.</p><p>It is also worth noting that any other loan to a consumer borrower which is secured on the residential property, such as a &quot;top up&quot; mortgage, will also be subject to the relevant housing loan provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 and the relevant Central Bank Codes.</p></reply>

As legislation currently provides for the relief to continue to end-December 2017, it was not necessary to include legislation in Finance Bill 2016 to provide for the tapered extension of the relief.  However in my Budget speech in October I confirmed my intention to extend MIR beyond the current end date on a tapered basis to 2020 and that the details of the extension will be set out in Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  Mortgage interest relief generally operates as a tax relief at source, meaning that the relief is deducted by the bank from the mortgage payment due, and the homeowner pays only the net amount due.  Therefore existing recipients of the relief would face a step effect in 2018 when their monthly mortgage payments would increase when the tax relief would have been withdrawn (all other factors being equal).  The purpose of the proposed tapered extension is to avoid a sudden significant increase in mortgage repayments for those losing the relief, but instead to withdraw the relief gradually, allowing the mortgage holder time to adjust to the change in mortgage repayments.</p>  <p>  As advised previously, at present, Section 244 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, with relief being available until 31 December 2017.  Mortgage interest relief has been abolished for homes purchased since 1 January 2013.</p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  First-time buyers who purchased between 2004 and 2008 when the property market was at its peak also receive an enhanced rate of relief.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.  It is worth noting that the application of the ceilings already work to reduce the relief available in a gradual manner.  In addition, as the amount of interest payable reduces as a mortgage is paid down, the level of mortgage interest relief also reduces in tandem.</p></reply>

Work on this commitment will be progressed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and my Department will actively contribute to the work as it progresses.  In that context, I expect that discussion on LGBT issues in the school curriculum will take place.  In the meantime, the current SPHE curriculum, the Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) programme, and the Action Plan on Bullying provide a framework within which schools and teachers can respond to specific issues relating to LGBT.</p>  <p>  All schools are required to develop and implement an RSE programme at junior cycle and senior cycle in post-primary schools.  RSE includes the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, and the development of attitudes, beliefs and values about relationships, sexual identity and intimacy.</p>  <p>  As students progress through an SPHE/RSE programme, they will encounter a wide range of issues that are addressed in an age-appropriate manner.  The emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all these issues, with specific information and focus on particular topics provided where and when it is deemed necessary by the teacher.</p>  <p>  RSE provides the context within which young people can learn about important moral, physical, social and emotional issues around relationships, sex and sexuality.  Post-primary schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, as set out in the curricular documents that have been provided, within the ethos and value system of the school.  Such a programme provides opportunity to explore with students the topic of sexual orientation.  The manner in which such issues are explored is contingent on the students' needs and the age-appropriateness of the content.  This includes supporting students to know where to get reliable information from trusted sources.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, which was published in 2013, sets out my Department&rsquo;s approach to tackling bullying in schools.  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, new National Anti-Bullying Procedures for schools, which include a specific reference to homophobic and transphobic bullying, were published in September 2013.  The Procedures place an emphasis on generating a positive school culture and climate that is welcoming of difference and diversity, and is based on inclusivity and respect.  The procedures offer advice to schools on steps that can be taken to generate a positive school climate and culture.</p>  <p>  It is noted that the general school climate and culture will promote positive attitudes and dispositions towards the whole-school community, outside of the teaching of specific subject areas such as SPHE and RSE.  A number of anti-homophobic and transphobic bullying initiatives, including BeLonG To&rsquo;s Stand Up! campaign, and the development of resources for schools to support LGBT students are also being supported through the implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the 30 September 2015.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for consideration by the Appeals Board at its October meeting under the Small Schools criteria.  The requirements set out in the staffing circular under this criteria state that the school must have the required enrolment on 30 September 2016 for the appointment of an additional teacher for September 2017 in order to be granted an appeal post for this school year.  In the case of this school, an enrolment of 19 was required on 30 September 2016 to meet this criteria.  As the school had an enrolment of 17 on that date, the Appeals Board determined that the appeal did not satisfy all of the published criteria as set out in Circular 0007/2016.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The measure announced in Budget 2017 provides a capacity for one teacher mainland schools to make an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board for an extra teacher, where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  Before a school can make an appeal to the Staffing Appeals Board it must have a minimum enrolment of 15 pupils.  The detailed arrangements for this measure will be set out in the staffing schedule Circular for the 2017/18 school year.  The circular will be published early in 2017.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists are recruited via regional panels formed from national recruitment competitions administered by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The school to which the Deputy refers lost its assigned NEPS psychologist to an internal transfer to another Region, following promotion, and while attempts were made to fill the vacancy in the NEPS Navan office from the existing PAS panel they were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  A new national recruitment competition was has been put in place by PAS to fill vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The closing date for applications is now passed and work is currently ongoing in relation to the examination of applications and short-listing of candidates for interview.  It is envisaged following interviews that recruitment panels will be formed and active filling of vacancies will commence in the new year.</p>  <p>  In the interim, schools whose service from NEPS are the subject of such vacancies have been advised that they may access assessment services via the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments described above and that they will continue to be able to access advice and assistance, in the event of a critical incident, from their local NEPS office.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s NEPS service will continue to communicate developments in this regard to the schools involved.</p></reply>

The Circular was developed following discussion with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has confirmed that catheterisation can be carried out by persons who are not medically qualified following education, training and assessment of ability to undertake the procedure safely.</p>  <p>  Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are employed by the managerial authorities of individual schools or by Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  The Board of Management is the SNA's employer and the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management, subject to Departmental guidelines.</p>  <p>  When appointing an SNA, it is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of the pupil(s) for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school.  Where additional training is required in order to carry out the assigned duties, the school authorities should arrange for the appropriate training to be provided to enable SNAs attend to the pupil&rsquo;s care needs.</p>  <p>  In some instances parents may be the most appropriate trainers for SNAs in relation to the catheterisation needs of their child in the school environment, as these parents have received comprehensive training from experienced staff in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin or Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital.  The HSE&rsquo;s Continence Care Adviser is also available to advise in relation to the management of incontinence.</p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNAs to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.  It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally.</p>  <p>  My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school, they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.</p>  <p>  SNAs should address any concerns they may have in relation to their assigned duties to the school Principal or Board of Management, as their employer.</p></reply>

This will allow parents, patrons and other stakeholders to have their say and to ensure that the right balance can be struck between competing rights and that there would be no unintended consequence that would create an adverse impact on the schools of minority denominations.</p>  <p>  I believe that this matter requires time to allow adequate scrutiny and debate in order to ensure any new approach is reasonable, fair and workable.  I believe that the work of the Education and Skills Committee will be invaluable in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 does not propose any changes to section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act and I propose to advance the Admissions Bill separately from the issues before the Committee.</p>  <p>  As I have said previously, I believe that this is the correct way to proceed.  In this way, we can ensure that the important pragmatic changes contained in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill can be implemented as quickly as possible, and not be tied up with contentious issues that could end up in the Courts.  At the same time, we can in this way give the time and space for the complex issues involved in the Equal Status Bill to be properly teased out.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that even if the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 is enacted by the Oireachtas in the coming months it cannot apply in respect of admissions in September next as schools have already begun that process.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 provides an over-arching framework for greater transparency and consistency in school enrolment generally and thereby gives greater confidence to parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools and the procedures used by them are legitimate, reasonable and fair.  The following is an outline of some of its key provisions:</p>  <p>  - The Education Admissions Bill will bring tangible benefits to all parents.  The Bill will oblige all schools to admit pupils where there are available places.  It is important to note that 80% of schools are not oversubscribed.</p>  <p>  - The Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.</p>  <p>  - The Bill includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.</p>  <p>  - The Bill contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.</p>  <p>  - The Bill also provides for the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) to designate a school for a child with no school place and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs.</p></reply>

The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned.</p>  <p>  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc.</p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the primary school sector (2012) recommended steps that could be taken to ensure that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions and none.</p>  <p>  A paper, entitled "Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions", which took account of the public consultation, was published in 2014.  The paper outlined good practice and options for promoting diversity in schools in a number of areas, including the right to opt-out of religious classes.</p>  <p>  The paper gives an overview of current practice in schools in relation to the right to opt-out of religious classes and acknowledged that each school should arrive at solutions that suit its own particular context and to engage in dialogue with parents about the arrangements to be put in place before the child starts school.  Schools are encouraged to develop their own practices and policies in this regard.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the Catholic Schools Partnership (2015) developed a resource for Catholic schools entitled &lsquo;Catholic Primary Schools in a Changing Ireland: Sharing Good Practice on Inclusion of All Pupils&rsquo;.  It gives suggestions on developing polices and sharing best practice with regard to inclusion of all pupils, which gives practical suggestions to schools in how to engage positively in inter-cultural dialogue.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which passed second stage on the 17 November 2016, also includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.</p>  <p>  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Department has also been working on draft legislation to provide for replacing the current Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998.  The legislation will provide the statutory basis for ministerial guidelines which will form the framework for a Parents&rsquo; and Students&rsquo; Charter in every school following consultation with parents, students, recognised school management bodies and staff associations representing teachers and other appropriate bodies.</p>  <p>  The Parents and Students Charter Bill essentially deals with how schools communicate with parents and will provide a greater opportunity for dealing with such issues.</p></reply>

Our aim is to provide an education and training system that equips learners with the knowledge and skills that they need to achieve their potential, and to participate fully in society and the economy through the delivery of high quality education and training experiences, which will make the best use of resources.</p><p>In relation to Higher Education, we now have a very comprehensive policy framework in place to steer the higher education system in the coming years.  The strategies for higher education, skills development, innovation, supporting access to higher education, international education and the future funding of the sector all have people, talent and growth at their core.  Links to each of these strategies are provided as follows:</p><p>1. The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, published in 2011, sets out the overall objectives for the system and priorities around teaching and learning, research, engagement, access and quality: <i></i></p><p>As part of the implementation of the National Strategy, in May 2013, the then Minister for Education and Skills announced a new performance framework would be put in place to increase the transparency and accountability of institutions for delivery of agreed performance outcomes.  Integral to this would be a process of strategic dialogue between the HEA and each higher education institution (HEIs).</p><p>The first System Performance Framework, stating national priorities and key objectives of Government for higher education for the period 2014 &ndash; 2016 was published by the then Minister in September 2013, following consultation with relevant Government Departments and agencies.  A copy of the current Framework is available at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>2. The National Skills Strategy was launched earlier this year and while encompassing the whole of the education and training system is highly relevant to the higher education system and sets out a number of relevant priorities for the next ten years including developing relevant skills across the population, employer participation in the development of skills and an increased focus on lifelong learning: <i></i></p><p>3. The Higher Education sector is key to the implementation of Innovation 2020 the new strategy for Research and Development and in particular for developing the people &ndash; the researchers required to deliver on our national ambitions.  A researcher's entire higher education experience contributes to their future success as a researcher and underpins Ireland&rsquo;s research system:</p><p><i></i></p><p>4. Supporting equity of access to higher education is an important national objective for both economic and societal reasons and my Department has had a strong focus on this for a long number of years and last December saw the launch of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-19:</p><p><i></i></p><p>5. The Cassells report on Future Funding for Higher Education, which was published in July 2016, is also an important development.  The Report clearly outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration.  The report is now with the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  I look forward to working with the committee to work out a viable, long-term funding model that we can all support.  We will require political and societal consensus to enable us to move forward with a realistic and achievable strategy for funding the system into the future: <i></i></p><p>6. Irish Educated - Globally Connected is the most recent strategy to be published and relates to international education.  This strategy was launched in October 2016 and represents a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s growth strategy for the next five years:<i></i></p></reply>

The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. </p>  <p>  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. </p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the primary school sector (2012) recommended steps that could be taken to ensure that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions and none. </p>  <p>  A paper, entitled "Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions", which took account of the public consultation, was published in 2014.  The paper outlined good practice and options for promoting diversity in schools in a number of areas, including the right to opt-out of religious classes.</p>  <p>  The paper gives an overview of current practice in schools in relation to the right to opt-out of religious classes and acknowledged that each school should arrive at solutions that suit its own particular context and to engage in dialogue with parents about the arrangements to be put in place before the child starts school.  Schools are encouraged to develop their own practices and policies in this regard.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the Catholic Schools Partnership (2015) developed a resource for Catholic schools entitled &lsquo;Catholic Primary Schools in a Changing Ireland: Sharing Good Practice on Inclusion of All Pupils&rsquo;.  It gives suggestions on developing polices and sharing best practice with regard to inclusion of all pupils, which gives practical suggestions to schools in how to engage positively in inter-cultural dialogue.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. </p>  <p>  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Department has also been working on draft legislation to provide for replacing the current Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998.  The legislation will provide the statutory basis for ministerial guidelines which will form the framework for a Parents&rsquo; and Students&rsquo; Charter in every school following consultation with parents, students, recognised school management bodies and staff associations representing teachers and other appropriate bodies. </p>  <p>  The Parents and Students Charter Bill essentially deals with how schools communicate with parents and will provide a greater opportunity for dealing with such issues.</p></reply>

A limited group of teachers were allowed to opt-out of the duties in return for a pay reduction i.e. as part of the Haddington Road Agreement, teachers in employment in 2012/13 were given a once-off opportunity to opt-out.  The pay reduction associated with opting out has a value of &euro;1,769 and applies permanently to the end of the teacher&rsquo;s career.</p>  <p>  The ASTI directive instructed its members to withdraw from the Supervision and Substitution Scheme with effect from 7 November 2016.  The opt-out is an element of the S&amp;S scheme and ASTI have directed all members to withdraw from that scheme.  Therefore, the &lsquo;opt-out&rsquo; provided for under the scheme will not apply to ASTI members who are subject to their directive.</p>  <p>  Following standard industrial relations practice, on days where employees do not make themselves available for any element of their core duties, resulting in the workplace not being able to function, that employee will not be paid for that day.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 23% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 14% to attend special schools.</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  Special classes are part of a continuum of educational provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools.  They offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  Special class for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 Ss for a class of 6 children.</p><p>Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.</p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are 1,153 special classes available, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548.</p><p>This includes 127 ASD early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approximately.  16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism.</p><p>There are 158 ASD classes attached to mainstream schools in Dublin, including 22 Early Intervention ASD Classes, 106 primary ASD classes and 30 post primary ASD. 17 of these are newly opened classes, including 3 Early Intervention ASD Classes, 9 primary ASD classes and 5 post primary ASD classes.  The NCSE continues to review the special class placement requirements in Dublin and is currently engaging with schools with regard to opening new special classes in Dublin in areas where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6 July 2016.  The Admissions Bill provides that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants.  The Bill contains a provision for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs). </p><p>Furthermore, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, the Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. reconfigure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved by the National Council for Special Education through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers.</p><p>The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.

Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Other supports provided to support pupils with SLDs include funding for schools for the purchase of specialised equipment and an information resource pack on Dyslexia, which has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  Supports for teachers are provided across the continuum of teacher education, from initial teacher education (ITE) to in-career teacher professional learning.</p>  <p>  In ITE, programme providers aim to prepare their student teachers to meet the diverse needs of all their pupils.</p>  <p>  The compulsory components of ITE are outlined in the Teaching Council&rsquo;s "Initial Teacher Education: Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (2011)" and include Inclusive Education (Special Education, Multiculturalism, Disadvantage, etc.).  The learning outcomes of ITE programmes also reflect the need for the teacher to be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs; to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching; to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils; to evaluate learner progress; to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes. </p>  <p>  In regard to ongoing professional learning opportunities there is provision for continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers with additional training needs through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  As well as the current broad spectrum of available courses, the SESS continues to update current CPD courses and design new CPD courses in response to the needs of teachers.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s psychological service, NEPS, provides ongoing advice, support and consultation to teaching staff in schools to build their knowledge and capacity to identify concerns, provide appropriate intervention and monitor the progress of students with a range of difficulties including, among others, dyslexia, dyspraxia and ADHD.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council acknowledges that teachers&rsquo; learning should be linked to teachers&rsquo; needs, students&rsquo; needs and school needs, and differentiated to suit the culture and context of teachers&rsquo; work.  Cos&aacute;n, the Teaching Council's framework for teachers&rsquo; learning, has an inherent flexibility to take account of all of these variables, while simultaneously enabling the needs of the students, the school and the system to be met.  In this context the emerging needs of teachers with regard to pupils with special education needs can be recognised and appropriate supports developed as required.</p></reply>

ASTI's decision to withdraw from these hours means that the union has repudiated the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  As a result, my Department issued Circular 0045/2016 which set out the arrangements for the application of the Lansdowne Road Agreement in respect of post-primary teachers.</p>  <p>  The Designated Community College sector is considered as having dual union representation i.e. both ASTI and TUI have representation rights in respect of teachers in such schools.  </p>  <p>  In the case of Designated Community Colleges, those teachers who are members of TUI (which has accepted to the Lansdowne Road Agreement) were asked to identify themselves to their employer Education and Training Board so that the agreement could be applied to them.  The provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts are being applied to all other teachers in the Designated Community College sector.</p>  <p>  As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal industrial relations practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, there are no proposals at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 23% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 14% to attend special schools.</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  Special classes are part of a continuum of educational provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools. </p><p>They offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.

Limerick for 2016/17 school year comprising 2 Early Intervention Classes for children who are not yet school going age, 7 primary school classes and 10 at post primary level.  8 of these classes are new classes open in September 2016, 1 Early Intervention Class, 3 at primary level and 4 at post primary level.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, are available on in county order, and with new classes identified. </p><p>The NCSE continues to review the special class placement requirements in County Limerick and is currently engaging with schools with regard to opening new special classes in areas where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6 July 2016.  The Admissions Bill provides that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants.  The Bill contains a provision for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs). </p><p>Furthermore, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, the Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. re-configure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved by the National Council for Special Education through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers.  The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.

The full roll-out of the scheme will be completed by 1 March 2017, with the introduction of HAP to the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal County Councils.  A multi-agency HAP Implementation Dublin Working Group has been established to advise and prepare for the introduction of the scheme to the Dublin region based on experience of the roll-out to date, and the particular pressures and characteristics of the rental market in Dublin.  </p>  <p>  The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, i.e. Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of this pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  To qualify for HAP under the homeless pilot scheme, a household must generally be accepted as homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988 by one of the four Dublin local authorities.  The Homeless HAP support has also been used to prevent households from entering homelessness and homeless services.   </p>  <p>  While eligible homeless households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Place-Finder Service, has also been established to engage directly with property-owners and support qualified households to find suitable tenancies and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place.   </p>  <p>  The operation and allocation of social housing supports is a matter for the housing authority concerned and is one in which I, as Minister, have no role.  If an applicant wishes to make an inquiry regarding social housing support or the HAP homeless pilot scheme they should contact the Housing Section of D&uacute;n Laoghaire- Rathdown County Council or the Dublin Region Homeless Executive directly.</p></reply>

This work helped inform decisions concerning the distribution of resources within the parameters of the national and fiscal budgetary position and the competing priorities presenting themselves at Governmental level.  Notwithstanding these competing priorities I ensured, in the approach to Budget 2017, that funding for the sector was secured in a number of areas, including in respect of pay costs and water related costs.   </p>  <p>  The levying of commercial rates is also a matter for local authorities.  The rates income of a local authority is determined by the Annual Rate on Valuation adopted by the local authority and the valuations of commercial property as determined by the independent Commissioner of Valuation.

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p><p>The first three TAPs covered the periods 2000-2004, 2005-2008 and 2009-2013.  Local authorities adopted the fourth and current round of TAPs in April 2014, with the five-year rolling programmes running from 2014 to 2018.  These programmes provide a road map for local authority investment priorities over the period.  They also form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for Traveller accommodation.  Local authorities submit proposals for individual Traveller-specific projects and developments which are assessed on a case-by-case basis in my Department in advance of allocations being made.</p><p>The capital allocations and amounts recouped to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and the totals for all City and County Councils nationally in respect of Traveller-specific accommodation for the years 2011 to 2015 and to date in 2016 are set out in the following tables. </p><p>The allocations and recoupment profiles for capital Traveller accommodation projects can vary across local authorities given the local priorities, circumstances and project timelines as set out in the local TAPs.  Also, where it is likely that an allocation to a local authority may be unspent or under-spent, my Department engages with local authorities to re-allocate the funding in order to ensure that drawdown is maximised.  Typically. the bulk of expenditure occurs in the last quarter of the year, having regard to lead in times for planning, design and construction of capital projects.  As regards the drawdown of 2016 funding, my Department has been in contact recently with the relevant local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council. regarding the drawdown of the funding.  The position will continue to be monitored closely by my Department over the coming weeks.<table><tr><th></th><th>Allocation <br /><br />2011 <br /><br />&euro; </th><th>Allocation <br /><br />2012  <br /><br />&euro; </th><th>Allocation <br /><br />2013 <br /><br />&euro; </th><th>Allocation <br /><br />2014 <br /><br />&euro; </th><th>Allocation <br /><br />2015 <br /><br />&euro; </th><th>Allocation <br /><br />2016 <br /><br />&euro; </th></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire / Rathdown County Council </td><td>750,000 </td><td>313,150 </td><td>160,000 </td><td>8,793 </td><td>0 </td><td>419,095 </td></tr><tr><td>All City and County Councils (incl.

LCDP was implemented by Local Development Companies until 31 March 2015 when it was replaced by the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), which was rolled out across communities following a procurement process.</p>  <p>  My Department considered the impact following the outcome of the competitive process for the new SICAP Programme, with regard to the network of Local Development Companies (LDCs).  It should be noted that my Department has no role in the internal operations of LDCs, which are independent limited companies, and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of each company, as the employer, to manage.  Each funding Department is responsible for its own funding and contractual arrangements with the LDCs. </p>  <p>  That said, in the past, my Department has, under certain circumstances, supported organisations to ensure that statutory redundancy payments have been made available to cushion the impact of job losses occurring as a result of reductions or cessation in funding for a particular activity or company.  During 2015, Ministerial approval was granted for the amendment of the LCDP financial guidelines to allow for certain redundancy costs to be charged to LCDP funding, subject to written agreement to the limits of spend.  The total number of employees who benefited from the scheme amounted to 66 employees, which equated to 52 Full Time Equivalents.  A limit was set of statutory payments plus an additional 1.5 weeks, subject to a cap of &euro;40,000 per person. </p>  <p>  Pobal managed the process on behalf of my Department, including acting as the paying authority, commensurate with its contractual role in LCDP.  It also engaged with stakeholders on mechanisms to address some of the issues and concerns in terms of business continuity, and due diligence etc., to achieve an orderly closure of LCDP, within a workable timeframe, commensurate with the need to observe EU procurement rules.  The process has concluded.</p></reply>

Choice-Based Letting (CBL) is a system that allocates social housing in a more efficient manner and also offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of refusals.  Local authorities that have introduced CBL over recent years have seen a significant reduction in their refusal rates. </p>  <p>  Accordingly on 30 September 2016, in line with a commitment in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, I introduced the Social Housing Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2016.

The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>The relevant provisions of Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 and the eligibility criteria of the pyrite remediation scheme are reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of Panel&rsquo;s report.  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material - Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.</p><p>There is no sunset provision in the Act.  Where a dwelling, which has a Damage Condition Rating of 1 and is currently not eligible under the scheme, progresses to a Damage Condition Rating of 2, an application can be made at that point in time for inclusion in the pyrite remediation scheme.</p></reply>

It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these schemes that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work as well as being fully unemployed for at least four in any seven consecutive days.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, they must also satisfy social insurance contribution and substantial loss of employment conditionality.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they must satisfy a means test.  Claimants are also required to comply with activation measures. </p>  <p>  Generally, entitlement under the schemes is withdrawn as a result of failure on the part of a claimant to satisfy fundamental scheme criteria.  Consistent with the objective of operating the schemes efficiently and effectively such withdrawals may be temporary in nature or a full disallowance may be imposed depending on the circumstances of an individual case.</p>  <p>  Where a person fails, without good cause to comply with activation measures, they may have their personal rate reduced.  The normal rate of payment may be reinstated at any time if the jobseeker complies with activation measures.  In July 2013, new legal provisions introduced a 9 week disqualification from payment after 3 weeks on a reduced Penalty Rate, for continued failure to engage with activation measures and extended the sanctions to prescribed employment programmes (Community Employment) and education courses.  No further changes to the Penalty Rate provisions have been made since then.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding.</p><p>The purpose of the humanitarian assistance scheme is to prevent hardship by providing income tested financial support to people whose homes are damaged from flooding and severe weather events and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair. </p><p>Expenditure under the scheme since 2010 is some &euro;5.3 million and a yearly breakdown of this expenditure is provided in the tabular statement.  There was expenditure of &euro;1.8 million to assist householders affected following the flooding last winter, which was the wettest winter ever recorded in Ireland. </p><p>Following a severe weather event staff, in my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service, closely monitor the situation on the ground and engage with the relevant local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  Emergency income support payments to cover essential items such as food, clothing and personal items are quickly issued in the immediate aftermath of the event.  Financial supports towards the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items may take longer as it is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.  The longer term financial support covers necessary remedial works and can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.  It could take several months before this final stage of the response is completed.  Statistics are not maintained on the average waiting times for payment.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p>Expenditure under the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme 2010 - 2015<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Outturn<br /><br />&euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1,045</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>714</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1,189</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>233</td></tr><tr><td>2016 estimated outturn</td><td>&euro;1,800</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In doing so, the survey explored the work experience and ambitions of disability allowance (DA) recipients. </p>  <p>  The survey found that 13% of DA recipients are currently working (part-time or full-time) while 31% had never worked.  56% of respondents stated they had previously worked (full-time or part-time) but were not currently working.  The survey also asked those who are not currently working to give an indication of their employment ambitions given the right supports.  Of those who completed this question, 35% expressed an interest in working part time, while 8% expressed an interest in full time employment.  </p>  <p>  The survey, undertaken as part of my Department&rsquo;s commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), also explores disability allowance recipients&rsquo; experience and ambitions in four key areas: education level and ambitions; work experience and ambitions; supports which would be helpful to achieve employment ambitions and barriers to achieving employment ambitions.  In addition, the survey explores recipients&rsquo; self-declared health status.  The survey will provide considerable assistance to my Department and the Comprehensive Employment strategy overall in the management and development of supports and services to help persons with disabilities find and maintain employment where this is appropriate and voluntary.</p>  <p>  The CSO survey of income and living conditions estimated that payments to people with disabilities reduced the pre-transfer risk of poverty rate from 80% to 15% showing the effectiveness of the social protection system both in terms of its adequacy and coverage.  In Budget 2017, I increased the rate of payment for those in receipt of disability and illness related payments by &euro;5 per week, with proportionate increases for qualified adults.</p></reply>

The STEA provides immediate access to those who qualify for jobseekers benefit wishing to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseekers benefit. </p>  <p>  The BTWEA is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years.  Following the announcement in the 2017 Budget, BTWEA will now be available to jobseekers after a reduced duration of 9 months.</p>  <p>  Under both schemes, those taking up self-employment must first have their self-employment project approved as viable and sustainable.  The proposed business/project must be approved in advance by a Local Development Company (LDC) or a case officer of the Department. </p>  <p>  The BTWEA is not available to persons already in employment or undertaking formal education as the scheme participants should be dedicating all of their time to the new enterprise.  The case officer or LDC must be satisfied that the self-employment venture will be full-time and sustainable into the future.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that other business supports for people considering starting their own business, who are not eligible for the BTWEA or the STEA, are available from LDCs under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme or from the Local Enterprise Offices.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These include programmes such as Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, CE schemes provide part-time temporary work in their local communities, including opportunities for training and development as a stepping-stone back to employment, for people in receipt of a range of social welfare payments, including those on a long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The T&uacute;s initiative is a community work placement scheme providing short-term working opportunities for unemployed people.  T&uacute;s was introduced as a direct response to the growth in the level of unemployment during the financial crisis.</p>  <p>  These schemes help to break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  My Department is also conscious of the valuable contribution the schemes are making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, issues such as the appropriate level of expenditure, the number of places and the criteria for participation on employment schemes, including CE and T&uacute;s, are all being considered.  I hope to be in a position to bring a Memo to Government on these matters in the coming weeks and following this, I plan to publish the review.  If there are any changes to be made, consultations with stakeholders will be facilitated.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

No grant will be available this year (2016).  Accordingly the Department of Social Protection has not made provision for the allocation of the water conservation grant in 2017.

It is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market.  In addition, as a community work placement scheme, T&uacute;s provides valuable services to local communities.</p>  <p>  The 12 month duration of a T&uacute;s work placement was set to reflect a number of inter-related requirements.  These include the need to ensure that the limited numbers of placements available are open to the maximum number of people on the live register, that weaknesses identified in other work programmes resulting from longer duration placements are not replicated and the need to ensure that the scheme fits with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s activation policies including Pathways to Work.  The existing placement period on T&uacute;s ensures that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme and it is considered to be optimal in meeting the scheme&rsquo;s objectives.  Currently, there are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s can be extended.</p>  <p>  With the welcome reductions in the live register, the eligibility criteria for work programmes, including T&uacute;s, will continue to be monitored to ensure that the schemes remains fit for purpose and that the eligibility conditions continue to be appropriate.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Minister.</p></reply>

Under the social welfare system, people who are homeless and people in temporary accommodation have entitlement to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance (SWA), subject to the normal qualifying conditions.</p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with local authorities.  Almost 880 homeless households have been supported under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) administered by the local authorities, of which some 650 are in the Dublin area.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, HAP is a key pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 and will transfer responsibility for all those on rent supplement with long term housing needs to the local authorities.  It is expected that HAP will be available in all local authorities in early 2017.  HAP represents a significant reform of the system and rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short term income support.  Any legislative reforms to the rent supplement scheme have to be carefully considered in the context of this significant change in policy direction.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the ongoing housing supply difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach in administering rent supplement that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits.  To date, approximately 9,300 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments.  There has been a significant reduction in the number of cases presenting following my introduction of increased rent limits in July 2016.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that supports to people experiencing homelessness remains a key Government priority at this time.</p></reply>

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market the rate of youth unemployment continues to fall  with a rate of 15.1% (30,500) in October 2016 (as estimated by CSO), compared to 15.9% (32,400) in September 2016 and a peak of over 31.1% (70,500) in 2012.</p>  <p>  In considering these figures it is important to note that youth unemployment in most economies  generally averages about twice the overall rate irrespective of the overall level of economic activity.  This is because of the lower rate of youth participation in the labour market associated with higher rates of participation in education as compared to older workers.  For example at an EU level youth unemployment is estimated by EUROSTAT at 18.2% as at September 2016 compared to an overall level of 8.5%.  The relationship between youth and overall unemployment rates is also clear in the Nordic countries which are generally considered to be forerunners of the youth guarantee approach.  For example youth unemployment in Denmark of 12% compares to overall unemployment of about 6.3%.  The equivalent numbers for Norway are 10.3% and 4.1% and for Sweden are 17.4% and 6.7%.  This relationship of youth to overall unemployment also holds over time - for example in January 2007 the EU youth unemployment rate stood at 16.7% compared to an overall rate of 7.6%; in Ireland the youth unemployment rate in January 2007 was 8.5% compared to an overall rate of 4.5%.</p>  <p>  Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate young unemployed people find and sustain employment.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).</p>  <p>  The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015.  The wage subsidy JobsPlus Youth is also available to employers who hire young jobseekers under 25 who were previously at least four months unemployed (JobsPlus is otherwise available to jobseekers over 25 who are at least 12 months unemployed).</p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p></reply>

Depending on the individual circumstances they could be considered employed (insurable at class A) or self-employed (insurable at class S since 1988 or class K prior to 1988).  Prior to 1988, proprietary directors who were deemed self-employed made class K PRSI contributions which did not provide entitlement to social welfare benefits.  PRSI for the self-employed was introduced in 1988.  Since then, proprietary directors who are deemed self-employed and aged between 16 years and 66 with earnings of more than a specified amount (currently &euro;5,000 per annum) are obliged to pay class S PRSI.  This provides entitlement to a limited number of benefits, including the State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that Section 16 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, provides that a working director with a shareholding of 50% or more in a company will be deemed to be employed under a contract for services and to be liable for PRSI class S contributions (as a self-employed person).</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

However, as previously advised in earlier replies, he is free to present any additional or new evidence in relation to the decision to the decision of the Appeals Office whereupon the Department may consider a revised decision or referring the matter for the attention of the Appeals Office.

The Government, as part of the budget package for 2017, announced 500 additional places on the scheme which will increase the overall number to 3,100.  The level of funding allocated to the RSS in the budget day estimates for 2017 is &euro;44.4m. </p>  <p>  A request for expressions of interest in additional RSS places was recently sent to all RSS Implementing Bodies.  My Department intends allocating these places as early as possible in 2017 taking into account a number of factors.  These include the number of places already allocated, the demand for new places in particular areas, work opportunities available in local areas and the numbers of farmers and fishermen and women in receipt of income support.  </p>  <p>  In allocating the additional places, the Government recognises the benefits the RSS provides for participants and their families, as well as the valuable contribution the scheme is making to the provision of services in communities across Ireland.  It is not possible at this stage to give the exact locations as to where these 500 additional places will be allocated. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, the Department recognises that abuse of the welfare system is an ongoing reality and must be tackled through a range of measures.  These measures are governed by the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018.  The actions set out in the strategy are designed to prevent and detect fraud, to ensure effective oversight of schemes, to pursue prosecution of offenders and to pursue the recovery of any overpaid entitlements identified. </p>  <p>  All Departmental staff exercise a control and compliance function in processing new applications and reviewing existing entitlements.  The systems used to support schemes are designed to detect wrongful claiming and to highlight anomalies.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate undertakes detailed examination of claims on a risk assessed and random basis.  This is supplemented by at least three fraud and error surveys of Departmental schemes annually and the findings from the surveys are used to tighten control measures around schemes, where this is found to be warranted.  The survey reports are published and subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy should note that my Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit, which comprises trained inspectors and Garda officers, is tasked with undertaking targeted and systematic examination of claims to tackle fraud and to work with other enforcement agencies to identify more serious breaches of the law.  </p>  <p>  Cross-functional and targeted actions are undertaken - both internally and in joint operations with other national and international agencies - to ensure a strategic response to high risk sectors or where fraud is considered to be most prevalent.  In particular, actions are focused on sectors of the economy where there is a risk of concurrent working and claiming social welfare payments.  </p>  <p>  Overall, my Department conducts of the order of one million reviews annually comprising customer entitlement reviews, inspections and special investigations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the continued roll-out of the Public Services Card has considerably reduced the potential for identity fraud and the Department has deployed identity and analytics software and other intelligence systems to reinforce its fraud prevention work.</p>  <p>  Members of the public also play an important role in supporting these anti-fraud activities and some 17,000 reports from concerned citizens have been processed already in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and annual updates on progress are published on the Department&rsquo;s website: www.welfare.ie.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should note that I am looking at various control measures that I hope to roll out in 2017 to strengthen the legislative provisions to deter abuse of the social welfare system.  These include publishing the names of persons who are prosecuted for social welfare fraud and applying interest on overpayments resulting from fraud.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy</p></reply>

The closed certification guidelines were developed following a six-month research study carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Medical Review and Assessment Service in conjunction with a group of GPs.  The study demonstrated that participating GPs considered the guidelines helpful in their interactions with patients and that they resulted in better outcomes for patients.  The guidelines are not prescriptive.  There will, undoubtedly, be individual variations, some patients recovering and returning to work earlier than expected, others later.  Ultimately, the clinical judgement of the treating GP should prevail.</p>  <p>  My department is involved in a modernisation project of its illness and injury benefit schemes which provided the opportunity to design a new medical certificate for these schemes.  Discussions are on-going to agree a list of common conditions and the use of the ICD10 international standard for coding.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that exploratory talks are taking place to examine whether the HSE HealthLink service could be leveraged for the transmission of electronic certificates.  A considerable amount of further discussion will be required before any determination is made on a move to this service.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to progress these matters with the relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I hope that clarifies the matter for the deputy. </p></reply>

The group is chaired by an Assistant Secretary who is also a member of the Interdepartmental Group on EU UK chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach which has a whole-of-government co-ordination role on Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The Management Board sub-group undertakes its work in a number of ways, depending on the particular circumstances, including by email, phone exchanges and by way of formal meetings.  It comprises 4 members of the Management Board and 2 members of the Department&rsquo;s EU and International Unit.  Other Departmental personnel assist this sub-group as the need requires.  The sub-group has held 3 meetings since February 2016.</p>  <p>  A Cross-Divisional Group has also been established to examine the detailed implications of Brexit for the various operations of the Department.  This group, which comprises representatives from the various payments sections and relevant policy and support sections, met in July 2016 and has undertaken an initial assessment of the implications of Brexit on a scheme by scheme basis.</p>  <p>  However, a particular impediment to undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the social protection implications of Brexit is the lack of clarity as to the UK&rsquo;s intentions in this area.  Free movement of EU workers and citizens was one of the central issues involved in the debates leading up to the UK vote to leave the EU.  Therefore, the potential social protection implications of that vote are intrinsically linked to the issues involved in the free movement of EU workers and citizens.  Until such time as the UK has itself decided what relationship it wishes to have with the EU following its withdrawal, the precise implications of Brexit for the Department of Social Protection will remain unclear.</p>  <p>  A number of cross-Departmental Brexit-related committees have been established and are being serviced by members of the Department&rsquo;s Management Board sub-group, including the Interdepartmental Committee on Brexit and its sub-committee on the Common Travel Area and the Senior Officials Group on EU Affairs.  In addition, the Minister for Social Protection is a member of the Cabinet Committee on Brexit, as well as being a member of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</p></reply>

Since 2015 this lone parent has seen an increase of almost &euro;44 or almost &euro;2,300 per annum between take home pay and State support.</p><p>A lone parent on the One-Parent Family Payment working 15 hours at the national minimum wage will see an increase in their overall income of almost &euro;18 per week (or almost &euro;940 per annum) from approximately &euro;348 in 2016 to &euro;366 in 2017.  </p><p>These increases are as a result of the increase in the National Minimum Wage, the increased disregards on One-Parent Family Payment and the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment and the rate increase of &euro;5 per week. </p><p>Initial indicative data from the latest Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) shows that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of lone parents in employment in the year to the end of June 2016.  The increase of lone parents taking up employment in the 12 month period prior to June 2016 has been four times higher than the equivalent increase in two parent households.  This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally.  However, the magnitude of the increase for lone parents (when compared with couples) many of whom would have been affected in July 2015 by the reforms is significant. </p></reply>

Overall, 58.8% of the 25,406 appeals which were finalised in 2015 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer/Designated Person.  To date in 2016, 58.7% of the 19,128 appeals finalised have had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>Of the 18,913 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2015, 6,886 (36.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,444 (64.5%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 14,215 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers in 2016 5,362 (37.7%) were determined following an oral hearing.  3,485 (65%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. </p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person as was the case in some 35 per cent of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015.  Where the decision was not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Decisions concerning entitlement to a social welfare payment or insurability of employment often require a high level of judgment and may involve complex legal questions.  The Courts have found that decision makers are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions.</p><p>Where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing, for example where the appeal question relates to contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.  Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeal Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Receipts 2015 &ndash; 2016</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2015</th><th>2016<br /><br />(to 31/10/2016)</th></tr><tr><td>Blind

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-22a.746" nospeaker="true" ><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 16.5% (33,800 persons) in October 2016 estimated by CSO, as compared to 20.8% (38,700) persons in October 2015 and a peak of over 31% (70,600 persons in 2012).</p><p>While systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes on all programmes specifically for those jobseekers under 25, some indicative figures are available. For example:</p><p>- The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016), shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey.  Overall, individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).</p><p>- JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In October 2016 there were 4,323 participants benefitting from JobsPlus, 765 (17.7%) of whom were under 25.</p><p>- In 2015 the level of satisfaction among under 25 year olds Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job was very high at 4.27, of a possible maximum of 5.</p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities.</p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under 25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.</p><p>Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020 sets additional targets in relation to addressing youth unemployment:</p><p>1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed;</p><p>2) to ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month;</p><p>3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers - these consolidate reforms undertaken in previous Pathways to Work strategies; the fourth action, to implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme, is a new programme.  Actions are in progress and on target.</p><p>I am satisfied that these policy measures, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment.</p></speech>

The availability of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) during normal office hours is therefore sufficient for general day to day requirements.  CWS services are delivered through Intreo Centres and some 180 clinics nationwide.</p>  <p>  However, in response to emergency situations such as those caused by severe weather events, local management assesses the response required to ensure that supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  This may include provision of emergency or out of hours services and may be supplemented by facilitating clients with individual appointments and making house calls. </p></reply>

It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  The official measure of unemployment is sourced from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS).  Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  </p>  <p>  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level.  This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories.  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments. </p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan and the Pathways to Work strategies, key policy documents to facilitate the young unemployed and the long-term unemployed, respectively, back into work, are underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above. </p>  <p>  By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the government&rsquo;s policy tends to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that actuarial reviews must be completed five years after the completion of the last review and that a copy of each review be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The last review (The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, 2010) was carried out by KPMG on behalf of the Department and was published in 2012.  This review projected (as part of its base case assumptions) that the number of persons aged 65 and over in the population would increase from 514,000 in 2010 to 750,000 in 2020 (and increase of nearly 46%) before rising again to 1,034,000 in 2030 (a further increase of nearly 38%).  The published actuarial review does not include data on the numbers of pensioners on a scheme by scheme basis.  However, this data will be included in the next review which is imminent. </p><p>In this regard, the Department has issued a Request for Tender to carry out a new Actuarial Review and this will be completed by end June 2017.  This review will provide more up to date projections of Social Insurance Fund expenditure and income in the coming years based on up to the most up to date demographic and economic data as well as the impact of social protection changes since the last review was completed.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to around 624,000 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure in the order of over &euro;2 billion in 2016. </p><p>Based on figures from the Department of Education and Skills the cost of extending Child Benefit to 19 year olds in second level education is estimated at just over &euro;100 million.  As Child Benefit is a universal payment, this proposal would not be targeted.</p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p><p>-qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments; </p><p>-family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children; </p><p>-the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p><p>Any changes to the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit could only be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

This has included difficulty in creating a system for licensing of aquaculture by the Loughs Agency in accordance with the intentions of the two Governments under the 1999 agreement establishing the North/South implementation bodies.  I want to see the Loughs Agency working to its full potential which is in the interests of everyone on this island.</p>  <p>  Following discussions in 2011 between the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the British Foreign Secretary, both Governments agreed to seek to address and resolve jurisdictional issues relating to both Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.</p>  <p>  Since that time a series of meetings have taken place at official level between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Of this total, &euro;486 million will be administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which manages the Irish Aid programme.  A further estimated &euro;165 million will come from other Government Departments and Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.</p>  <p>  We believe that an ambitious external aid budget is critical to ensure the EU can meet its commitments in the fight against global poverty, while maintaining its leadership on the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  In this context, the response to the current migration and refugee crisis has placed significant additional demands on EU development programmes and instruments.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget is calculated by attributing our percentage share of the overall EU Budget as a Member State to the total EU expenditure on ODA.  The EU Commission is forecasting strong growth in ODA-eligible expenditure in 2016 and again in 2017.</p>  <p>  Based on the Commission-forecasted increase in the EU Development Cooperation budget for 2017, and an expected increase in Ireland&rsquo;s percentage share, we are prudently projecting Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget to be in the region of &euro;100 million, an increase of almost &euro;10 million on the 2016 established estimate.  This accounts for the bulk of the increase in the overall allocation to ODA for 2017.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the financing of the EU&rsquo;s development cooperation and humanitarian programmes comprise: our annual share of the EU Development Cooperation budget which covers the Development Cooperation Instrument and Humanitarian Aid; our assessed contribution to the European Development Fund (EDF); and our contributions to a number of specific EU Trust Funds. </p>  <p>  The current EDF runs from 2014 to 2020.  Although the amount of our EDF contributions has increased from &euro;29.27 million in 2014 to &euro;32.76 million in 2016, as programming demands on the EDF have increased, Ireland&rsquo;s percentage share of contributions to the EDF has not changed over the past two years.  Ireland is also contributing to three specific trust finds: the Trust Fund for stability and addressing root causes of migration in Africa (a voluntary contribution of &euro;600,000 for each of the years 2016-2020); the Colombia Trust Fund (a voluntary contribution of &euro;600,000 per year for each of the years 2016-2020); and the Facility for Refugees in Turkey (a mandatory assessed contribution of almost &euro;23 million over the 2016-2019 period, with a first payment of just over &euro;5 million in 2016).</p>  <p>  Ireland engages actively at political and official levels in discussions with our EU partners and with the European Commission Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development to ensure that our development policy priorities are reflected in EU programmes.  Member States are currently working to agree a revised EU Consensus on Development to ensure that EU development cooperation is aligned fully with the SDGs and responds to new global challenges.  I will attend next week&rsquo;s meeting of Development Ministers under the Foreign Affairs Council where these issues will be under consideration.  I was very pleased also to welcome Development Commissioner Neven Mimica to Dublin last month and I had a constructive meeting with him to discuss Ireland&rsquo;s priorities for EU development cooperation. </p></reply>

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that 14 million people in the region are now in need of humanitarian assistance.  This includes up to 1.7 million internally displaced people in Adamawa, Borno, Gombe and Yobe States, of which over half are believed to be children.  OCHA has indicated that just 38% of the consolidated humanitarian funding requested from donors in 2016 has been received.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month, our Ambassador to Nigeria visited Borno State to assess the security and humanitarian situation.  He met in Maiduguri with representatives from various UN agencies and NGOs operating in the region.  The Ambassador visited a number of camps for displaced people, including in the towns of Bama and Gwoza.  Following the visit, on behalf of the EU, the Ambassador briefed the United Nations Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel, Mohammed Ibn Chambas.  Our Embassy in Abuja continues to consult widely with the Nigerian Government, at senior political and official levels, on issues relating to the humanitarian emergency.</p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners are providing significant assistance in response to the humanitarian crisis and continue to support the Nigerian Government in ensuring a secure environment for its citizens.  The EU has pledged up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which supports 8,700 troops from Nigeria and neighbouring countries in promoting regional security.  The European Commission has also provided $52.4 million in humanitarian funding for the North East.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland has provided &euro;3 million in direct response to the crisis in the region.  This includes &euro;325,000 for Irish Aid's NGO partners, &euro;1 million for the work of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), and &euro;1 million for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). </p>  <p>  Under Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Initiative, six rapid responders were deployed this year to work with our UN partners&rsquo; humanitarian response operations in the country.  We also airlifted 110 tonnes of emergency relief supplies into north-eastern Nigeria and to Niger to help Nigerian families displaced by conflict to meet their basic shelter and other needs.</p>  <p>  We are continuing to monitor the situation in the region closely and to examine how we can contribute further to the response to the humanitarian crisis.</p></reply>

The settlement process is not only illegal, but routinely involves dispossession and seizure of land, eviction of those already living there, and imposition of restrictions on the surrounding population.  It is thus a major cause of tensions and provocations on the ground.  As I have stated before, these actions are incompatible with a genuine commitment to reach a peace agreement, and call into serious question the intentions of the Israeli Government.</p>  <p>  We regularly convey these concerns to the Israeli authorities, and I have raised them myself with Israeli Ministers on my visits to the region, most recently in June.  Ireland also works worked to focus EU and international attention on them, and the issue of settlements is a central focus of our engagement on the Middle East conflict.</p>  <p>  Our concerns over these policies are most acute in relation to the West Bank, where they are making impossible the achievement of a peace agreement and the establishment of a Palestinian state.  By contrast, it is generally acknowledged that any comprehensive peace between Israel and the Arab states will involve the return of the Golan area to Syria.</p></reply>

During this transition period, the Government will avail of all opportunities to engage with the incoming Administration and sensitise them to our issues and concerns &ndash; not least the shared commitment of successive Irish and US governments to the peace process in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Government will continue to work with the current US Administration which has made a sustained commitment to the peace process over the last eight years.  In this regard, we owe a particular debt of gratitude to President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry for their appointment of Senator Gary Hart who has made a very positive contribution to political progress in Northern Ireland over the last two years.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-22a.834.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016112200073#WRP00900"><p>As requested, I am providing the Deputy with an itemised list of all international treaties and conventions which the State has signed, but not ratified, in tabular form.  The list has been prepared according to the information available to my Department and aims to be as comprehensive as possible.  The purpose of the agreements is indicated by the title in most cases and further information is either publicly available or can be made available by my Department should it be required.</p><p>There are 74 agreements on the list:</p><p>- 17 Multilateral agreements for which the UN Secretary-General is the depository;</p><p>- 19 Council of Europe agreements;</p><p>- 23 EU agreements;</p><p>- 8 Other multilateral agreements; and</p><p>- 7 Bilateral agreements.</p><p>The two-step process whereby a state will first sign an international agreement subject to ratification or some other form of approval, such as an exchange of notes informing of completion of the necessary internal procedures, is the usual manner in which international agreements are concluded.  This interval permits states to take whatever legislative or administrative measures are required to fulfil obligations assumed under the agreement.  The signing of an agreement may be an important demonstration of a state&rsquo;s support for it, pending its ratification when in a position to do so.  Whilst a state is not bound by an agreement which it has signed but not ratified, it is obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat its object and purpose.  The alternative would be to refrain from signing the agreement at all, which may be interpreted as a lack of support for the agreement.  In this regard, there is nothing unusual, or wrong in principle, in having some time period between signature and ratification, and the length of time required may depend on the complexities of the particular issues involved.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Article 29.6 of the Constitution provides that international agreements do not form part of the domestic law of the State unless the Oireachtas so provides through the enactment of legislation.  This is what is known as a &ldquo;dualist&rdquo; approach to international agreements.  In contrast, for some states, ratification of an international agreement automatically incorporates the terms of that agreement into its domestic law.  Such states may be in a position to ratify agreements more quickly than dualist states such as Ireland.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have an important role in relation to all international agreements entered into by Ireland.  Before a treaty may be signed, ratified or acceded to, it is necessary to obtain an authorising Government Decision.  As the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 designates the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as the Minister responsible for external relations, all Memoranda for the Government concerning international agreements (other than International Labour Organisation Conventions) are brought by me, irrespective of their substantive content.  Where the agreement is the functional responsibility of another Department, as is usually the case, the Memorandum is brought by me on behalf of the relevant Minister. </p><p>Therefore, while my Department has a central role in relation to signing and ratifying international agreements, it is often the case that the necessary legislative or administrative measures required to implement them are for the line Department responsible for the subject matter of the agreement.  Line Departments, in taking steps to ratify an agreement, will consult with my Department as the ratification process develops to ensure that important procedural steps are followed. </p><p>My Department lays all international agreements before this House after they enter into force for Ireland and annually publishes all such agreements in the Irish Treaty Series, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  A notice of all agreements laid before the D&aacute;il is also published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  In addition, a list of the international agreements which have been signed but not ratified by Ireland is published on the Department&rsquo;s website and updated annually. </p><p><b>List of

The Group recently presented for consideration and agreement by Government an interim report setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government at this time.  The report has been approved by the Government and is available on the OPW website, . </p><p>A Steering Group to establish a National Flood Forecasting Service has met on six occasions in 2016, agreed a Terms of Reference and prepared and agreed an implementation plan comprising a number of phases, including an initial set-up phase (scheduled for completion by Q3 2018) and a development and trial phase (scheduled for completion by Q1 2020).  Given the complexities involved in establishing, designing, developing and testing this new service, it is anticipated that it will take 4-5 years before it is fully operational and will require a staffing complement of 15 full-time posts at that point.  Met &Eacute;ireann has appointed one new staff member to date to lead the project.</p><p>The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group has met on five occasions in 2016, held three public consultation days and has agreed to trial the lowering of lake levels in Lough Allen and consider the costs and benefits of piloting the removal of pinchpoints and dredging of the Shannon, as a further commitment to enhance co-ordinated activities by the relevant State Agencies.  The work programme for the agencies involved and other information is available on the OPW website, . </p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group is considering the potential costs and benefits associated with the introduction of an individual property protection scheme.  The Group is being informed by two pilot projects which are currently underway in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny and Crossmolina in County Mayo.  The OPW is funding the cost of the consultants engaged to carry out the property assessments in the locations in question and will reimburse Mayo County Council for the cost of installation of the pilot flood gates in Crossmolina.  The Co-ordination Group&rsquo;s work, when completed, will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the merits of the introduction by Government of any scheme to support individual property protection measures. </p><p>A review of the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme is currently underway with a view to examining the criteria for consideration within the Scheme, including for example the various thresholds for the assessment of benefit.  Consultations are underway with Local Authorities with a view to examining any potential improvements, administrative or financial, which will encourage applications under the scheme.  The review will be carried out in the shortest possible timeframe and is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. </p><p>On 8th November I announced funding of &euro;2m for a targeted humanitarian aid scheme for those primary residential properties that flooded during last Winter and had flooded in previous years to ensure those worst affected homeowners have a primary residence.</p><p>While the Government has agreed that the terms of funding for relocation will be in line with the previous scheme in 2009, I am to appraise Government of the ongoing review of the administrative arrangements from that earlier scheme, to ensure that the arrangements for this once-off scheme are reflective of its targeted objective and all relevant circumstances.</p><p>I want to ensure that the funding is targeted at those homeowners at greatest risk of future flooding and would gain greatest benefit from State support to relocate.</p><p>The Office of Public Works is working jointly with Local Authorities and the Department of Social Protection to identify and prioritise homeowners and review the administrative arrangements for this scheme.  I hope to be able to appraise Government and subsequently make initial contact with a small number of targeted homeowners towards the end of this year.</p><p>Further examination is ongoing by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, OPW and Local Authorities in evaluating on an individual basis if any alternative remedial works can be undertaken to protect those at risk farm buildings that flooded again last Winter in order to inform the feasibility of any future once-off targeted scheme for Voluntary Farm Building Relocation.</p><p>Guidance and support to clarify the rights and responsibilities of landowners in relation to the maintenance of water course on or near their lands is being developed for Spring 2017, subject to legal advice.</p></reply>

The approved proposals, which subsequently were enacted through the FEMPI Act 2015, provide for changes to occur in three phases, on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2016, increases in the exemption thresholds for PSPR application were activated.  These exemption threshold increases fully removed PSPR from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR received a boost of &euro;400 per year.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR adjustments, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, will fully remove PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR, in most cases, by &euro;500 per year. </p>  <p>  On 1 January 2018, the third phase of PSPR adjustment will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</p>  <p>  These phased PSPR changes across the public service will cost an estimated &euro;90 million on an annual basis and, when fully implemented, will ensure that only the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR.</p></reply>

Once a company is struck off, then its assets vest in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The vesting is automatic and does not require any intervention from the Minister.  As a result, the Minister is not aware of assets vested in him on the dissolution of a company and therefore it is not possible to quantify or value assets that may have devolved to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the State Property Act, 1954.</p><p>The following amounts have transferred in respect of the monetary assets of dissolved companies to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the past three years: </p><p>2013 - &euro;151,997</p><p>2014 - &euro;10,843,477*</p><p>2015 - &euro;513,400</p><p>2016 (to date) - &euro;371,483</p><p>The interest acquired by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is described as a defeasible interest as it may be defeated by the restoration of the company, which can happen up to 20 years after its dissolution.

The Guide also clarifies the position in relation to the key concerns that the Irish authorities had expressed in relation to the uncertainty that had been created by the revised MGDD which had been issued in March 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department has carefully considered the provisions of the new Guide, in conjunction with the NDFA, the CSO and also colleagues responsible for PPP policy in other jurisdictions.  NDFA are currently making the necessary changes to the template contract to reflect the requirements of the new Guide in this regard.  The CSO will continue to assess PPPs based on finalised contracts and the latest guidance and will confirm this assessment with Eurostat.  My Department and the NDFA are confident that the clarity and certainty brought by the latest guidance allows us to continue to procure PPPs based on the template PPP contract currently used by the NDFA (and TII) with only a few relatively minor modifications required to ensure that the projects will continue to be classified as off-balance sheet.</p></reply>

This scheme was carried out by the Office of Public Works (OPW) under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 and the OPW continues to have a statutory responsibility for its maintenance.</p>  <p>  This year the South West Region prioritised a section of Flood Defence at Callinafercy East which was in much greater need of refurbishment works due to its deteriorated condition.  The timing of work on individual projects is determined having regard to the needs of regular maintenance and the prioritisation of urgent jobs.</p>  <p>  OPW did carry out some coastal defence works at Douglas this summer following the completion of necessary appropriate assessments.  This involved the placing of rock armour at this location to protect an eroded flood defence.</p>  <p>  It is this Office&rsquo;s intention to carry out flood defence refurbishment works at Gurrane in summer 2017.  The Appropriate Assessments are in place to allow works to proceed, pending one final otter survey in advance of works commencing.</p>  <p>  Each year the OPW carries out work to approximately 2,000km of channels and some 200 structures around the country as part of its ongoing and rolling arterial drainage maintenance programme.  While the average cycle of maintenance is generally in the range of 4 to 7 years, the OPW does routinely inspect all channels and structures for which it has maintenance responsibility.</p></reply>

This will be based on the inclusive, open and consultative approach that has worked so well this year.  At all times, the Government has been supported in its plans by the guidance and advice of the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations and the Oireachtas All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations.</p>  <p>  For example, next year, we will remember the battle of Messines.

Almost &euro;60m has been provided in the 2017 Estimates for the Irish language, Gaeltacht and Islands programme, including funding for An Foras Teanga.  This effectively represents an increase of &euro;2.3m over the 2016 provision when account is taken of capital developments such as Inis O&iacute;rr pier and Ionad Cult&uacute;rtha an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc. </p>  <p>  As I indicated in my response to Questions No. 285, 287 and 288 on 8 November 2016, the budget for Foras na Gaeilge is subject to approval in due course by the North South Ministerial Council, given its status as an agency of An Foras Teanga, which is a North South Implementation Body co-funded with the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  An indicative provision of &euro;13.239m has been provided within my Department&rsquo;s Vote for An Foras Teanga in 2017.  In regard to funding for specific programmes of work, the dispersal of the budget will be an operational matter for Foras na Gaeilge within the framework of the NSMC-approved business plan and budget.</p>  <p>  With regard to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, an additional &euro;1m in once-off capital funding had been secured as part of the 2016 Revised Estimates.  This has been retained for next year, which means that &euro;6.687m is the new capital baseline in Budget 2017 for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta &ndash; an increase of &euro;1m on the baseline in Budget 2016.  In addition, I have secured an additional allocation of &euro;2.4m for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s for capital projects in 2016.  I will continue to seek additional capital resources for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s over the coming period.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that in order to further underpin the implementation of the 20-Year Strategy and the language planning process, as set out in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, a specific allocation of &euro;1m has also been provided in the current year.

The international evidence is that the age of onset of dementia is increasing in high income countries and the illness duration is reducing.  It is hypothesised that this is due to better treatment to reduce recurrence of vascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke.  At this point it is uncertain whether or to what extent  this positive trend may be offset in the future due to the higher prevalence of excess weight, obesity and diabetes.  However, the increasing population of older people in Ireland means that the number of cases of people who have dementia is likely to increase.</p><p>It is a priority of the 2014 National Dementia Strategy  to ensure that dementia is better recorded in primary and secondary care and that data from the Single Assessment Tool (an IT-based system to access health statists and care need of older people which is at an advanced stage of development) is used in future research to inform dementia care in Ireland.</p></reply>

Nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention is a priority for the health service.  There are many initiatives currently underway to improve staffing levels throughout the country in the short, medium and long term.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts.  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.  In addition, a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 continues to be available to nurses who return from overseas.</p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have also been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates.  Measures to date include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.  Last month the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates.  This decision means that all nurses and midwives will receive incremental credit for the 36 week placement restored from 1 January 2017, restoration of the credit to 2016 and future graduates having been approved earlier this year.  It is estimated that the inclusion of 2011 to 2015 graduates will benefit around 4,000 nurses who are currently working within the public health service and potentially another 3,000 who may wish to return to the public system in the future.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase of almost 1,200 nurses employed in the public health service (34,336 to 35,534) from September 2014 to September 2016, numbers having fallen by almost 4,600 from 2007 to 2014.  The total budget for the health service in 2017 is &euro;14.6 billion, the highest budget ever allocated to the health service and this will allow for the recruitment of additional nursing staff to meet service needs.  Given recognised difficulties in filling psychiatric nursing vacancies, an additional 60 undergraduate places have been put in place this autumn with a further 70 additional places to be provided next year.</p></reply>

The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  The manufacturer has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine.</p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply, the HSE will be guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on its administration.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older weighing less than 25kg.

An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  Section 55 also provides for the charging of private in-patients.  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient.  Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.</p>  <p>  It is the case that only those who express their wish to be treated as private patients are subjected to the private charges under Section 55 of the Health Act.  It is not the act of having private health insurance which makes a person a private patient but rather the waiving of their eligibility for public hospital services.  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant, the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient.</p>  <p>  While everyone ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to use a public hospital, an essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.

However, the HSE has confirmed that it does not have any policy to operate the private in-patient charging in the manner suggested and will investigate any cases brought to its attention.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan.</p><p>The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  Earlier this year, I announced that we are providing &euro;100 million in capital funding from now until 2021 in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions  identified by the HSE.  This will  ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community.  I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.</p><p>In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is providing &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.</p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period.</p><p>- Strand 1 - is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards;</p><p>- Strand 2 - is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and</p><p>- Strand 3 - is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;, </i>I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.

The proposed AHR legislation will include specific provisions relating to surrogacy and the assignment of parentage in such cases.</p>  <p>  The proposed legislation will take cognisance of the 2014 Supreme Court judgment in the MR &amp;amp; Anor v An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors (surrogacy) case, which found that the birth mother, rather than the genetic mother, is the legal mother.  It is envisaged that the legislation will establish a mechanism for transfer of parentage from the surrogate (and her husband, if she has one) to the intending parents.</p>  <p>  In addition, it is envisaged that under the surrogacy provisions, at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child.  Surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis where the payment of defined and receiptable reasonable expenses will be allowed, however, commercial surrogacy will be prohibited.</p>  <p>  It is the intention that the legislation in this area will protect, promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR.</p>  <p>  Drafting of the General Scheme is in progress and it is envisaged this will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017.  Once the General Scheme is complete, I intend to submit it to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></reply>

From that date, long stay contributions will replace the existing system of long stay charges for in-patient services (under section 53 of the Health Act 1970 and associated regulations).</p>  <p>  The long stay contributions framework requires that affordable contributions be made towards maintenance and accommodation costs by service users in residential settings where services are provided directly by the HSE or by agencies funded under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 to provide services on behalf of the HSE.  The framework reflects modern residential support models (primarily in the disability, mental health and care of older people sectors).</p>  <p>  From 1 January 2017, long stay contributions will apply to the further provision of residential support services (other than acute in-patient services and nursing home services provided to those supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme/Fair Deal), to persons who have already received at least 30 days of such services during the immediately preceding 12-month period, irrespective of where those 30 days of residential support services have been received.</p>  <p>  Long stay contributions will be contributions towards the maintenance and accommodation costs associated with providing residential support services (similarly, charges under the existing long stay charges system are charges in respect of the maintenance element of the in-patient services provided).</p>  <p>  The Health (Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contributions) Regulations 2016 provide for three different classes of income-based long stay contributions towards accommodation and maintenance costs in three accommodation categories:</p>  <p>  - Category A (to which this question relates) refers to accommodation where 24-hour nursing and/or medical care is provided, subject to a maximum of &euro;175 per week for a person whose income is &euro;208 per week or more.  These rates are identical to the rates which currently apply under the existing long stay charges system.</p>  <p>  - Category B relates to contributions payable by those in accommodation where part-time nursing and/or medical care is provided and is subject to a maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 per week or more.  Again, these rates are unchanged from the current system.</p>  <p>  - Category C relates to all other non-nursing settings (such as independent living settings), subject to a maximum of &euro;70 per week for a person whose income is &euro;188 per week or more.</p>  <p>  In all three accommodation categories, contribution rates will be on sliding scales, with proportionally lower contribution rates applying to those on lower incomes.</p>  <p>  Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the long stay contributions provisions (as with the existing long stay charges system):</p>  <p>  - Firstly, section 67C of the Health Act 1970 caps the maximum contribution amount that may be set at 80% of the non-contributory State Pension weekly rate.</p>  <p>  - Secondly, the relevant Regulations are structured to ensure that those making long stay contributions will retain income for personal use of at least &euro;33 per week for Category A residents (in full-time nursing settings), at least &euro;64 per week for Category B residents (in part-time nursing settings) and at least &euro;118 for Category C residents (non-nursing settings).</p>  <p>  - Thirdly, section 67D of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a contribution where appropriate, in order to:</p>  <p>- avoid undue financial hardship on the part of the service user and/or on the part of the service user&rsquo;s dependants,</p>  <p>  - advance a service user&rsquo;s identified needs (e.g. care plan objectives), or</p>  <p>  - take account of separate contributions (if any) made by a service user towards his or her maintenance or accommodation costs.</p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the framework, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the correct determination of long stay contributions and comprehensive waiver guidelines (approved by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform) on the individual circumstances where such contributions may need to be reduced or waived.  The guidelines specify that service providers must have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants.  The guidelines ensure that the applicable contribution may be reduced or waived where appropriate, taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings, including reasonable regular financial commitments, with a view to ensuring there is no unfair burden on the service user or on his or her dependants.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the long stay contribution scheme which will commence on 1 January 2017 and the existing long stay charges scheme are reasonable and fair and ensure that each service user's contributions are based on what he or she can afford, taking account of the service user's individual circumstances.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country.  The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process.</p>  <p>  Engagements to date have seen the Department of Health, HSE and IMO agree a number of service developments including: the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes; an enhanced support framework for rural GPs, which has seen an increase in the number of qualifying GPs to over 300; and a revised list of special items of service under the contract to encourage the provision of more services in the primary care setting.  These measures, combined with the under-6s and over-70s initiatives, have increased the financial support for general practice.</p>  <p>  Preparations for the next phase of discussions on a new GP contract are under way.  These discussions will address a wide range of issues, including the role of GPs in delivering chronic care within the community.  The option of salaried GPs for areas where it has proven difficult to attract and retain GP services, for example in isolated or socially deprived areas, is one of the issues I intend to have considered in the context of the development of a new contract.  I expect that further engagement with GP representative bodies will take place before the end of the year.</p></reply>

In March of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a HTA of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of Kalydeco.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.

In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.

All of the monies collected by way of stamp duty are transferred to a Risk Equalisation Fund administered by the Health Insurance Authority and redistributed back to health insurance companies by way of credits in respect of older and sicker people.  Increasing the credits and stamp duties under the scheme is needed to continue to share costs across the market.</p>  <p>  The amount of any increase or decrease individual insurers pass on to consumers is a commercial decision for each of them.  Insurance companies operate as commercial providers and as Minister for Health, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s prices.  The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations.  Each of these are contributors to the cost of care, the cost of claims and therefore the cost of premiums payable.</p>  <p>  We have a highly competitive insurance market.  Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing their level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority website offers a clear price comparison and can be accessed at www.hia.ie.  All of the health insurers provide a number of lower cost plans, affording consumers the opportunity to find value in the market and to access the level of cover appropriate to their individual or family needs.</p></reply>

In the 2017 budget, an additional &euro;3m has been provided for a number of measures aimed at improving the health outcomes of those affected by addiction issues.  The increased funding will support the development of a pilot supervised injection facility in Dublin city centre, the wider availability of alternative opiate substitution treatments for those who are not suited to methadone, improved services for under 18s and more detoxification beds.</p><p>Drug and Alcohol Task Forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in their areas and in coordinating action at local level, so that there is a targeted response to the problem of substance misuse in local communities.  Every effort has been made to protect the budgets of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in recent years.  In excess of &euro;27.6m has been allocated to the Task Forces for community-based drugs initiatives this year, the same amount provided in 2014 and 2015.  The Department of Health will shortly be writing to Task Forces to invite them to submit their recommendations for funding of drugs initiatives in 2017.

This is evidenced by fostering mental health promotion through campaigns like the 'Let's Talk' and 'The Little Things' campaigns.  These are directed at a whole-of-society level, including young people.  Another example is the expansion of the Jigsaw service nationally, with the development of new youth orientated services at Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</p><p>In line with Programme for Government commitments to improve mental health care for young people, I recently convened the National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health that brings together perspective and insights from public, private, community and voluntary sectors.  The Taskforce is operating as an action-oriented, decision-making group focussed on making improvements and getting things done.  An over-riding objective is to achieve more integrated services, and to address identified gaps over current provision.  It is working in collaboration with many different sectors and communities to improve:</p><p>- Emotional literacy around talking about mental health and reduce stigma;</p><p>- Awareness of services and supports;</p><p>- Accessibility to services and supports at different times and in different areas; and</p><p>- Alignment of services and supports across different providers (public, private, community, and voluntary).</p><p>The Government also recognises that schools play a vital role in the promotion of positive mental health in children, through strong working partnerships fostered between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Health Service Executive.  For instance, one particular initiative in this area is progressing <i>Well Being in Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion</i>.  The whole-school implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education framework at classroom and whole-school levels supports the effective delivery of mental health and well-being education. </p><p>The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service has been prioritised in new funding made available by Government since 2012, designed to support timely access to appropriate services to address the mental health needs of all children, with the emphasis on the early intervention and integrated service.  Additional resources and facilities means that we now have 67 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service teams, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams, supported by 66 operational Child and Adolescent Mental Health beds nationally.  The HSE is continuing to address acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health staff, particularly Consultant Psychiatrists, to realise the potential for enhanced services overall.</p><p>The Deputy may rest assured that future improvements will be implemented in all aspects of our Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services for 2017 and beyond, arising both from the significant new funding provided by the Government in Budget 2017, and in the context of agreeing priorities for Mental Health under the HSE Service Plan for next year.</p></reply>

The NDTP has carried out research that infers there is a short fall of respiratory consultants in Ireland.  Work is ongoing in NDTP to develop evidence informed workforce plans across all medical specialties, including respiratory.  When completed, the plans will be used to inform workforce related decision making including the most appropriate number of postgraduate training places and consultant appointments.  A key objective is to ensure that the correct number of doctors are training or trained in each specialty to meet both the current and future needs of the population with the correct balance between generalist and specialist doctors.</p>  <p>  In line with the Department's Statement of Strategy 2015&ndash; 2017 the Department is working with the Health Service Executive to implement an approach to workforce planning and development with the objectives of recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff.  This National Integrated Strategic Framework for Health Workforce Planning is intended to reshape Ireland&rsquo;s future health workforce planning to support and enable the productivity of the existing workforce, the recruitment and retention of a highly valued workforce, and the expansion of the size, skills, competences and behaviours of the future workforce to meet current and emerging demands.  In June 2016, the Department of Health convened a cross-sectoral Steering Group, including NDTP, to begin the work on developing recommendations for the establishment of governance systems and a framework for integrated health workforce planning in Ireland.  It is expected that a report and a high level implementation plan will be submitted to the Minister in early 2017.</p></reply>

This sub-committee is chaired at senior level within the Department and has met four times since it was established.  It is made up of representatives from across the Department of Health and also includes representation from the HSE at National Director level.  In this way, work on Brexit-related issues is mainstreamed throughout the Department and well coordinated with the HSE.  Representatives of the Management Board sub-committee participate fully in the Senior Officials Group on EU Affairs and the groups coordinated centrally by the Department of the Taoiseach which support the Cabinet Committee on Brexit, including the Interdepartmental Group on EU/UK Affairs, and as appropriate the IDG's workgroups . </p>  <p>  In addition to the Management Board sub-committee, an Interdepartmental/Interagency Group has been established to prepare a bid for the relocation of the European Medicines Agency on foot of a Government Decision at the end of October.  The Government believes that Ireland would be a very suitable location and that a move to Dublin would minimise the disruption to the business of the EMA, thus ensuring continued protection of EU citizens and providing reassurance to the industries which it regulates.  The Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Agriculture Food and Marine, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as well as the Health Products Regulatory Authority, Health Research Board, IDA Ireland and  Science Foundation Ireland.  The first meeting of the Group took place on 8 November.</p>  <p>  The implications of the UK referendum throughout the island of Ireland were discussed at the North South Ministerial Council health sectoral meeting held on 9 November and the plenary meeting held on 18 November.  Ongoing contact at political and official level will be maintained over the period ahead. </p></reply>

The health needs of Travellers cannot be remedied or improved in isolation from addressing the societal, cultural, educational and environmental factors that combine to influence health as well as more obvious health related factors such as lifestyle issues and access and usage of health services.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice and Equality is leading on the development of a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.  The Department of Health is represented on the Steering Group developing the Strategy.  The Strategy, which is expected to run from 2016 to 2020, aims to provide a set of specific actions that need to be taken to improve the situation for Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  It is envisaged that the Strategy will include agreed actions in relation to improving the health of travellers.  </p><p>The Department commissioned an internal review of the role and functionality of the Traveller Health Advisory Committee (THAC) in 2013 in order to inform the Department's consideration of the appropriate national structures required to address traveller health.  The review was presented to the Department in June 2013.  This internal review was not published at the time as it formed part of the Department's deliberative process in considering the future role of the THAC.  The review found that the transfer of the health budget to the HSE in 2006 resulted in significant changes to the functioning of the THAC and that the original purpose and focus of the Committee had changed.  The THAC has not been convened since the review.  The Traveller Health Advisory Forum, chaired by the HSE, continues to act as a national forum for discussion on issues around traveller health.  In the circumstances, the Department intends to await the completion of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy to inform consideration of the necessity for any additional national structures to address traveller health.</p><p>In the Department traveller health issues are firstly addressed in the context of <i>Healthy Ireland</i>which is the national framework for action to improve the health and well-being of the people of Ireland.  <i>Healthy Ireland</i>takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and provides an overarching approach to addressing health inequalities among Travellers.  The Healthy Ireland Council was established as a multi-stakeholder forum to support the implementation of <i>Healthy Ireland</i>across sectors.  The Council includes a representative from Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre.  The Department's Social Inclusion Unit also works closely with the HSE and oversees the delivery of traveller specific health measures by the HSE.</p><p>The Deputy's questions regarding traveller health funding and the HSE Service Plan for 2017 have been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Furthermore where the area overdeclared is over 3% and not greater than 10% the penalty is further reduced to .75 times the difference where it's the first time the herdowner has been penalised under the new rule.  These measures it is expected, will contribute to the reduction of errors and the penalties applied.<table><tr><th colspan="3"><b>

The second period will commence on 04 December.  </p>  <p>  The available quota for this fishery (the main fishery) is 13,857 tonnes.  Landing data received from the SFPA on 14 November indicated that vessels had landed 10,617 tonnes (77%) with two weeks remaining in the current period.  </p>  <p>  I have not received any request from the CSHMAC to vary the arrangements put in place at the start of the season.  I suggest that requests for amendments to the arrangements be addressed to the representative of the CSHMAC.  I accept, as far as possible, the recommendations of the Committee.</p></reply>

This was to ensure that payments were targeted at &ldquo;trained young farmers&rdquo; who have a genuine interest in farming.  Approximately, 2,000 young farmers required places arising from the education requirements of the Young Farmers Scheme and the National Reserve. </p>  <p>  My Department in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, approved the appointment of 70 education officers and 7 administrative staff on two year contracts to enable Teagasc dramatically increase enrolments for the Green Cert Programme.  The scheduling of courses and allocation of teaching staff within the Teagasc network of agricultural colleges is an operational matter Teagasc and not the Department of Agriculture.  I understand that most of the teachers have been recruited and are helping to deliver record numbers of Green Cert enrolments.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above measure, the agreed delegated sanction arrangements for Teagasc provide them with greater flexibility over permanent staff appointments.  The arrangements enable Teagasc to replace staff when they retire and to make 75 new appointments subject to compliance with multi-annual pay ceilings.  While Teagasc must remain within its overall pay budget, the flexibility provided by the new arrangements will allow them to fill critical vacancies and to react faster when such vacancies arise in the future.  I understand a number of education appointments have been made to help meet the current demand for places.</p>  <p>  As can be expected, the Young Farmers Scheme and National Reserve has stimulated added interest in the adult Green Cert among other farmers who have &ldquo;registered an interest&rdquo; with Teagasc in completing the course.  My Department has asked Teagasc to explore other staffing measures, beyond further temporary recruitment, to ensure that any residual demand for the Green Cert can be accommodated within a realistic time-frame.  My Department will continue to monitor the Green Cert situation in Teagasc closely.</p></reply>

The new arrangements came into effect on 1 November 2016. </p>  <p>  Unlike the previous arrangements, which involved the selection of a suite of ear tags submitted by a single supplier based on the &ldquo;most economically advantageous tender&rdquo;, the new approval arrangements provide for the approval all ear tags which meet the standards set out in the Tag Approval document.  The fact that an applicant may have not been successful in a previous public procurement competition is not relevant in an approval process seeking multiple suppliers.  </p>  <p>  As indicated my reply to PQ No. 31629/16, the standards required in respect of security for identification and traceability purposes are the same as heretofore.  Applications for approval from tag suppliers are assessed against the requirements of EU regulations relating to bovine identification, as well as the necessary ancillary service requirements, such as secure premises, ability to interact with the Department's IT system, data security, etc.  The suitability of the tags is objectively assessed by independent experts and applications are evaluated by an Evaluation Committee. </p>  <p>  The Department has received 3 applications to date under the approval process.  One applicant has been approved. The Department has decided to grant approval to a second applicant for the supply of official bovine identification tags to herd keepers, subject to completion of the IT system in a manner that meets the Department&rsquo;s requirements.  The third application is currently being assessed by my Department.</p></reply>

This builds on the Energy White Paper published in December 2015 and recognises that solar also has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby also enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.  With this in mind, Solar Photovoltaics (PV) is one of the technologies being considered in the context of a new support scheme for renewable electricity generation which is under development.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The first Technology Review public consultation on a new renewable support scheme was published in 2015 and following the completion of detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting a range of renewable technologies - including Solar (PV) - a second public consultation will be published in early 2017.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that up to 70% of premises in Ireland will have access to  commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the  remaining 30% consisting of just over 750,00 premises will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  Currently, approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers. </p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p>  <p>  There are 1.6 m premises in the BLUE area of which approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband.  My Department is actively monitoring the deployment in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services.  In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p>  <p>  My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

First, in normal circumstances, people are required to present themselves in person at an office of the National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) when renewing or replacing their driving licences.  However, where a person is out of the country for a period for study or work purposes, they  may apply to renew or replace their licence by post, without the requirement to appear in person at the NDLS.  The second issue is that of residence.  Under EU law, Member States issue driving licences to those normally resident in their jurisdiction.  As I have indicated, a person may be normally resident in a Member State even if they are living abroad temporarily for work or study purposes.  However, if a person has taken up permanent residence in another country they are not eligible to be issued with an Irish driving licence.</p></reply>

For each of the three airports, the study will identify the priorities and recommended timeframe for new infrastructure development or adjustments to existing infrastructure to pre-empt any constraints on growth arising from lack of capacity.In relation to Dublin Airport only, the study will set out a reasoned recommendation for the timeframe for the development of new terminal capacity (Terminal 3), the options in terms of appropriate size and design and the optimum location.  The review will also assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of the funding and operation of Terminal 3 by the existing airport operator in comparison with being operated on an independent basis.

When the centralised National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) was introduced in 2013, it was a requirement that people should appear in person at an NDLS centre when renewing their driving licences.  This caused difficulties for people temporarily abroad for work or study reasons.  The regulations were therefore changed in 2014 to enable people who were abroad in such circumstances to renew their licences by post.  The Deputy may wish to note that, under EU law, we may issue driving licences only to people normally resident in our jurisdiction.  'Normal residence' includes people whose normal residence is here but who are abroad temporarily for work or study.  However, if a person has taken up residence abroad they are no longer entitled to renew their Irish driving licence.</p></reply>

With regard to existing infrastructure, there is an on-going programme to upgrade public transport infrastructure and facilities to help improve transport accessibility across the country.  The programme is managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) on behalf of my Department.  I acknowledge that there is still work to be done in this regard and with this in mind, my Department is committed to undertaking a review of our Sectoral Plan in the near future.  I understand that at present at least 84 out of the 143 railway stations on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network have received accessibility upgrades or were constructed new to accessibility standards.  Accessibility upgrades are planned for several stations in 2017 and recently construction works  commenced at Rathdrum, Mullingar and Leixlip Louisa Bridge stations.  Some lightly used stations may not be fully upgraded and instead, passengers with mobility impairments within the catchment area of these stations will continue to be facilitated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann through the provision of a taxi or hackney to the nearest accessible station; this is arranged at a local level.   ​</p>  <p>  While there is still considerable work to be done, I think it is important to note that a lot of progress has been made, and continues to be made, in relation to accessibility within the Public Transport Sector.

My Department is now engaged with the NTA to clearly frame the policy to guide any detailed legislative drafting, with passenger safety the key focus.  I will consider the legislative proposals which emerge when this work has been progressed, following which I should be in a position to outline an indicative legislative timeframe.</p></reply>

It was launched last week with the publication of the Rail Review 2016 - which the NTA undertook in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann - together with an NTA consultation document "The Role of Rail in Ireland and Funding its Delivery". Both documents are available on the NTA's website.  The public consultation process will give the public and all interested parties the opportunity to give their views and contribute to the debate on the future of heavy rail in Ireland.  The public consultation process will run until 18th January and the NTA will then prepare a report based on the findings; thereafter I intend to bring this report to Government.  No decisions will be made about the heavy rail network before the public consultation process has concluded and been evaluated.</p></reply>

This allows applicants the freedom to choose to renew for particular categories and not for others, should they so wish.  It is a very minor burden on applicants.  Asking the National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) to make this decision for people would add to the process burden in the NDLS for every licence, while curtailing individual freedom.  I therefore do not intend to change the regulations in this regard.</p>  <p>  I have no power to intervene in individual cases such as that raised by the Deputy.  As a general point, a driving licence category which has not been renewed may be reclaimed for up to ten years after it has lapsed.  Unfortunately, if it has not been renewed within that period, and the person wishes to regain the category, they must apply as a learner in that category.</p></reply>

This issue has been receiving public comments in the last few weeks. </p>  <p>  Yesterday I raised the matter at the Retail Consultation Forum to express the Government's concern at this issue and the need to pass on to consumers the benefit of the Euro's appreciation against Sterling.  I was advised at that meeting that some of the differentials between prices quoted in Euro and Sterling may be attributed to such factors as the exchange rates at the time of the purchases by the retailers, the relative costs of doing business between the two jurisdictions and tax rates.</p>  <p>  As I stated at the Forum, it is my view that retailers should explain to their customers and to the economies in which they operate why there are such price differentials between the two currency areas.  I believe this will also address issues such as consumer confidence in the retail sector.</p>  <p>  I wish to underline the Government's commitment to ensuring that the benefits of the stronger Euro are passed on to Irish consumers.  Following yesterday's meeting of the Retail Consultation Forum, I am working with the sector to ensure an ongoing response by retailers in the period ahead with a view to securing satisfactory progress on the issue.</p></reply>

The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p>  <p>  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into export entities.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories, i.e. Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development grants for existing businesses that want to expand.  It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p>  <p>  In addition, for anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course) or provide a mentor to work with the business proposer.</p>  <p>  Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.</p>  <p>  Finally, I should draw your attention to the &lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; Online Tool (www.localenterprise.ie/smeonlinetool) which is a cross-governmental initiative to help start-ups navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible.

This first Interim Report focused exclusively on the Commission's request for an extended time frame for the completion of the reports of the confidential committee and social history modules.  The Government agreed to the requested extension and all three reports will now be completed by February 2018.  This remains within the three year timeframe provided for this statutory investigation.  Importantly, the extension of time will serve to accommodate the large number of witnesses coming forward and to ensure that new information being discovered can be fully analysed to give a complete understanding of the social history involved.</p>  <p>  In granting the extension the Government also asked the Commission to separately report on any additional matters outside of its scope which it considers may warrant further investigation in the public interest as part of its work.  A second interim report was submitted by the Commission on the 16th September 2016 in response to this request. Since receiving this report I have met with the Commission to discuss the report and the general progress being made with the investigation.  Given the broad scope of the Commission's work, a number of issues in the report extend beyond the remit of my Department.  For this reason, it has been necessary to consult with my Cabinet colleagues and the Attorney General on these matters.  I have also sought additional information from the Commission to assist in these deliberations.  My intention is to publish the report in conjunction with Government's response to the Commission's findings.  I hope to conclude this process as quickly as possible and I will ensure the publication arrangements are notified directly to the various advocacy groups representing former residents and their families.</p>  <p>  The costs associated with the Commission are met from my Department's Vote.  Since its establishment the Commission has directly incurred costs totalling &euro;3.015m (to end of October 2016).  This expenditure consists of &euro;1.630m in pay; &euro;1.117m for operational costs (including accommodation), and &euro;0.268m for other costs related to the investigation.  In addition, my Department has also incurred costs to date of approximately &euro;0.386m in supporting the establishment and operation of the Commission.</p></reply>

Annual commemorations are also held by the Defence Forces at the National Memorial in Merrion Square during the summer months.  In addition, commemorations are held in military barracks during November.</p>  <p>  A commemoration to honour deceased members of the Defence Forces was conducted in November 2015 at the National Memorial in Merrion Square on a pilot basis.  Having considered the pilot, I am satisfied that deceased members of the Defence Forces are already appropriately remembered at dignified commemorations throughout the year and there is no requirement for a further public commemoration.  It is therefore not my intention that this ceremony would become an annual event. </p>  <p>  Arrangements are currently being made to award the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to all members of the Defence Forces who have served during this centenary year of 2016.  It is a fitting tribute and thank you from the Government, on behalf of the people of Ireland, to our Defence Forces and it is my intention to recognise also the service of Members of the Defence Forces who passed away during 2016.</p></reply>

The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in his role by a number of branches in the Department.  In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the UK has not yet left the EU and withdrawal negotiations cannot begin until Article 50 has been triggered by the UK.  Negotiations will probably take at least two years to complete and all potential consequences of the Vote will remain the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has adopted a contingency framework to deal with all issues arising in respect of the UK vote to leave the EU.  Accordingly, any issues arising, including those within the Defence area, whether bilateral, or in respect of developments in CSDP, or regarding our wider international multilateral defence engagements, will be also addressed within that framework.</p></reply>

The proud record of the ship in operational service with the Naval Service was duly recognised and the range of activities which the ship was involved in was recalled and commended.</p><p>There are a number of recognised methods for disposing of a ship which has reached the end of its effective or economic service life within the Naval Service.  Options available include the donation, or sale for re-use by way of public auction, which allows for the refurbishment and reuse of a vessel by a secondary party.  Such uses can include operational restoration for further life as a ship, or vessel reutilisation as a museum.  Indeed the possibility of donating a vessel as a museum or visitor attraction arose in connection with the disposals of the former<i>L&Eacute; Emer</i>and the former<i>L&Eacute; Aoife.</i></p><p>However, the former <i>L&Eacute; Emer</i>was disposed of in 2013 by way of public auction, and &euro;320,000 was realised by the Exchequer in this regard.  In 2015, the former <i>L&Eacute; Aoife</i>was transferred to the ownership of the Maltese Armed Forces on humanitarian grounds following a request from the Maltese authorities, to endeavour to deal with the ongoing refugee crisis in the region.</p><p>The question of using the former <i>L&Eacute; Aisling</i>as a visitor attraction in Galway City has been raised with me and is under consideration.  I am advised that given the age, size, structure and layout of Naval Service vessels that they are considered rather unsuitable for conversion to use as museums or visitor attractions.  Many issues arise in connection with the conversion of vessels into visitor attractions.  This is because a vessel requires ongoing protection measures to affect the physical condition of the vessel to defend it, to stabilise the structural integrity of the vessel, and to guard it from deterioration.  A vessel must be kept structurally sound, weather resistant and watertight and this requires the availability of materials and competent personnel with requisite skills and expertise to carry out work, at a significant cost.  There are other significant costs for the recipient associated with a donation of this type, such as health and safety issues and insurance liabilities and risks.</p><p>The former <i>L&Eacute; Aisling </i>is currently being stored on water at berthage facilities at the Naval Base in Haulbowline, County Cork.  Given the pressures on berthage infrastructure and the cost of maintenance on the vessel, the most cost effective and responsible approach will have to be taken into consideration in informing my decision on this matter.  I will be concluding my approach on the disposal of the former<i>L&Eacute; Aisling </i>very shortly, and I will take all of these matters into account.</p></reply>
