To this end, three specific measures are currently being developed and implemented by my Department.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>provides that, as part of the development process for the Action Plan for Housing, we will explore the option of incentivising developers to build and lease back homes to housing authorities and associations.</p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme currently provides a means whereby properties can be can be built or bought by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) with the combined use of State and private funding, and leased by AHB&rsquo;s and Local Authorities from private providers, for the provision of social housing.  Changes are now being proposed to this scheme to provide revised arrangements which serve to expand these mechanisms to facilitate larger institutional private investors that want to build and lease back homes to housing authorities and associations.</p><p>The Programme for Government further provides for the introduction of a new model of affordable rental to deliver more housing options for low income households. &euro;10m has been committed to this scheme in 2016.</p><p>The National Development Finance Agency is acting as financial advisor to my Department in respect of these schemes.  In addition, a Social Housing Public Private Partnership to provide for a capital investment of &euro;300 million is currently being implemented.  This PPP programme will deliver 1,500 social housing units.</p><p>Each of these initiatives is in addition to social housing being delivered by other means, including through Exchequer capital spending.</p></reply>

Going beyond this level would require the agreement of the landowners and developers of this area in the context of an acquisitions strategy.   </p>  <p>  A detailed planning scheme is in the process of being drawn up for the area by Dublin City Council as a comprehensive planning framework for its orderly development and I understand from the City Council that this is expected to be published for public consultation before the end of this year.  </p></reply>

The proposed operating model seeks to put in place planning and implementation arrangements that will deliver more effective and efficient public libraries with a view to securing the delivery of an enhanced quality and range of services.  This will ensure the long-term sustainability of the library service in Ireland.</p><p>The key challenge in the present structure is the need for the creation of scale for existing library authorities, in particular in the smaller counties.  In order to achieve this, it was determined that a new operating model for library authorities should be established, with a minimum population target of 100,000 as an appropriate basis for determining a revised libraries&rsquo; structure.</p><p>The proposed model does not involve the closure of libraries nor will it require the reduction of the library services available in those areas; in fact, the model seeks to enhance the services that are available.  It will secure a stronger senior management structure and increase capacity across the relevant library authorities to focus on frontline services and opportunities for enhanced individual and community support services and engagement<i>.  </i>Discussions have commenced with the relevant local authorities with a view to exploring how the proposals might best be implemented and all options will be considered as part of these discussions.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-29a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062900059#WRA01600"><p>A range of actions is currently being considered to provide for the much needed boosting of supply of all types of housing, including increasing the delivery of social housing, in the immediate, medium and longer-term.  These actions, including possible legislative changes, will be brought forward in the context of the new &ldquo; Action Plan for Housing &rdquo; which will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>A key objective of the Plan will be to accelerate, and exceed if possible, the delivery of the targets under the <i>Social Housing Strategy:</i>importantly, local authorities and approved housing bodies already have a strong pipeline of construction, turnkey and acquisition projects underway, which will deliver some 3,900 homes, with approved budget costs of some &euro;680 million.</p><p>The most recent changes to legislation which impact on the delivery of social housing were a number of amendments made in 2015 to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which provides for the provision of social housing units from within private developments.</p><p>The amendments provide for Part V delivery of 10% of the total units in a scheme, with the priority being the delivery of social housing.  Crucially, the options of a payment of cash in lieu of units, or the transfer of sites or parts of sites, have been removed.  The focus is now on the delivery of completed units and the amendments seek to maximise the contribution Part V can make to social housing supply and sustainable mixed-tenure communities across the country.  An increase in the overall supply of housing in the coming years will therefore yield a dividend for social housing under the provisions of Part V. </p><p>The operation of Part V is kept under review in my Department, in consultation with local authorities, and should further legislative changes be required, in the light of experience with the revised provisions, I will bring these forward.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-29a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062900060#WRB00300"><p>While issues concerning the enforcement of waste legislation are a matter for local authorities who have significant powers under the waste regulations to secure compliance by waste collectors, my Department has introduced a number of measures to strengthen efforts to improve enforcement generally.</p><p>Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) have been established in each of the three existing waste regions with responsibility for coordinating waste enforcement actions and ensuring consistent enforcement of waste legislation, while still leaving local authority personnel as first responders on the ground to specific breaches of waste legislation.  This will facilitate a transformation from process-driven enforcement, structured around separate implementation of individual regulations, to one that focuses greatest effort on the waste problems and issues that matter most and to take swift, proportionate and effective action.</p><p>The work of the WERLAs is being supported by continued funding provided by my Department for the local authority waste enforcement network.  Some &euro;8.2 million is being provided in 2016 for the retention by local authorities of 155 specialised waste enforcement officers, critical to tackling issues such as illegal dumping in local communities and in providing an enhanced response on the ground to infractions of the waste code.</p><p>A working group on the introduction of the Pay-By-Weight charging consisting of members from my Department, the WERLA&rsquo;s and National Waste Collection Permit Office (NWCPO) has to date devised and completed a programme of data collection and inspections to help ensure that household waste collectors are, <i>inter alia,</i>weighing waste and making those weights available to customers.  The first phase began in March 2015 with an information and awareness visits followed by vehicle inspections (June 2015), customer account inspections (February 2016) and back office Inspections (April 2016).  There are currently further inspections on-going in coordination with the NWCPO review of waste collection permits.</p><p>An effective system of waste management is critical to the welfare of the environment and society in general and the appropriate use of enforcement powers currently being deployed by local authority waste enforcement personnel is important, both to secure compliance with the law and to ensure the provision of appropriate household waste collection services.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-29a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016062900060#WRB00500"><p>The specific matters in relation to the Longboat Quay development are currently before the Courts and, as a consequence, are subjudice.  In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this development at this time.</p><p>In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the <i>Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014</i>, which provide for greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p><p>Statutory certificates of compliance, where relevant, must be given at commencement (design only) and completion and must be signed by a registered construction professional (i.e. an Architect or a Building Surveyor or a chartered Engineer who is included on a statutory register maintained respectively by the Royal Institution of Architects of Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland or Engineers Ireland).  The statutory certificate of compliance on completion must also be signed by the builder.</p><p>In effect, the statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the <i>Building Regulations</i><i>1997 to 2014.</i></p><p>The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 were reviewed following their first 12 months in operation.  It is clear from this review that the recent reforms have brought a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects.  I am confident that as the transition to the new arrangements for the control of building activity continues to progress, these reforms will in time prove capable of transforming the culture of the construction industry in Ireland to one of improved compliance and quality.</p></reply>

This network will incorporate existing and future maritime special areas of conservation established under the Habitats Directive and special protection areas designated under the Birds Directive for which my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible in the first instance.  It will also incorporate specific marine protected areas created under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  These will be agreed at a regional level and may be located either fully or partially in Ireland&rsquo;s marine jurisdiction.  My Department will be working with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other member states in our CFP region to designate marine protected areas of this type.</p>  <p>  While many such areas can be, and have been, established under existing legislation, there may also be a requirement for other types of marine protected area which do not readily fall within the ambit of existing statutes.  These would require new enabling provisions in legislation.  It is my intention to introduce such legislation at the earliest opportunity, within the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall legislative priorities.  This legislation will also formally identify special areas of conservation or protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives or under the CFP as Marine Protected Areas for the purposes of the MSFD.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this, we need to identify what additional marine protected areas are required including what form they should take, where they should be located, and whether they should be local to Irish waters or transboundary in nature.</p>  <p>  Identifying marine protected areas and developing the necessary legislation will require consultation with other relevant Government Departments and State agencies as well as other key stakeholders.  These stakeholders include other EU member States, external scientific experts, NGOs and those who use the marine environment as appropriate.  This process will also work in tandem with the development of any maritime spatial plans under the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, for which my Department is also responsible.</p></reply>

This legislation provides for global valuations of utility undertakings to be carried out by the Valuation Office every five years and entered on the central valuation list.  This can result in either increases or decreases to the relevant valuation.  In 2015, the Valuation Office carried out global valuations for Gas Networks Ireland, Iarnrod Eireann and telecommunications companies BT Ireland, Eircom, Vodafone, Three Ireland and Meteor.  In November 2015, the Valuation Office issued a copy of the Valuation Certificate and a schedule setting out the apportioned value for each rating authority to my Department.  The previous valuation for these utilities had taken place in 2010.  The Global Valuation Certificates showed a reduction in the combined valuations for these utilities of &euro;112m.  In addition, the reduction in the global valuation of the ESB, following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, reduced the rates payable by the ESB from 2016.</p>  <p>  The timing of the global valuations in 2015 caused particular difficulties for local authorities as they were published at an advanced stage of the local authority budgetary process.  In this regard, my Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it was agreed that there would be a once-off adjustment in support from the Local Government Fund in 2016 to local authorities affected by the global valuations.  The additional allocation provided was on an exceptional and once-off basis, solely for the 2016 budgetary period.</p>  <p>  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  As such, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.</p></reply>

Further consultation will take place with relevant stakeholders ahead of any formal national consultation programme being launched.  An invitation will issue shortly from my Department to all Oireachtas Members to attend a briefing on the National Planning Framework next month.</p><p>In line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, it is anticipated that the National Planning Framework will be finalised by the first quarter of 2017, taking account of all relevant inputs and statutory requirements.  It would be inappropriate at this early stage to comment on the likely content of the framework, until sufficient preparatory and consultative work has been undertaken.  </p></reply>

The Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i>that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period.  In addition, the Act increased the minimum period of notice of new rent from 28 days to 90 days.  Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.  Further provisions to support rent stability in the 2015 Act include that a notice of new rent must be in the prescribed form, include details of dispute resolution procedures available through the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and be accompanied by details of the rent sought in respect of 3 comparable dwellings in the area.</p><p>The rental market in Ireland has grown significantly in recent years and now accounts for around 20% of total Irish households.  In Dublin rents are now back to 2007 peak levels.  The most recent RTB rent index shows that in the first quarter of 2016, rents were 8.6% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2015.  Data for Q1 2016 show that rents have continued to increase, although the rate of growth slowed in most sectors.</p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing rising rents in the medium to long term is through increasing the supply of housing.  Housing is an absolute priority for this Government and, accordingly, a key priority of the Programme for a Partnership Government is the preparation and publication of an &lsquo;Action Plan for Housing<i>&rsquo;</i>within the Government&rsquo;s first 100 days.  The Action Plan will be drafted with input from a number of key Departments, and will draw on the work of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which submitted its final report to the D&aacute;il on 17 June 2016.</p><p>In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government also contains a specific commitment to review the regulatory regime for the rented sector to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the rights, interests and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.</p></reply>

The NAF will specify the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures in different sectors and by local authorities in their administrative areas in order to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change and to exploit any beneficial opportunities.  The 2015 Act also provides that relevant Ministers will be required to develop sectoral adaptation plans which will specify the adaptation policy measures the Minister in question proposes to adopt; these measures will include, for example, adaptation actions to be implemented by OPW and other responsible Departments and agencies in relation to flood risk management.</p><p>The policy response to climate change in terms of mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases and adaptation to the negative impacts will, over time, help to protect people, buildings, infrastructure, businesses and ecosystems and these benefits will apply to both rural and urban communities.  Apart from climate change related considerations, revitalisation of these communities is also recognised as a priority in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, with a series of specific actions identified to facilitate the regeneration of urban centres.  In this context, the Government will seek to introduce a new Town and Village Renewal Scheme to support the revitalisation of towns and villages and improve the living and working environment of communities.</p><p>In addition, it is also proposed to examine a series of further initiatives, including the introduction of a scheme, similar to the<i>&lsquo;Living City Initiative&rsquo;,</i>to regenerate urban centres and villages; the establishment of a national register of derelict sites, in addition to the new vacant site levy, to bring vacant and underutilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes; the mandating of local authorities with better land management powers; reclassifying and incentivising the use of under-utilised or vacant areas over ground floor premises in urban areas; and examining the scope to reform the Derelict Sites Act to tackle the under-use and hoarding of derelict land. </p></reply>

The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.</p><p>Seventy four estates were identified to the Pyrite Panel as possibly having pyrite.  At the time of the <i>Report of the Pyrite Panel</i>(June 2012), all of these estates were located in the five local authority areas of Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly, although two estates were subsequently identified in 2014 as having pyrite problems, one each in the administrative areas of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council.</p><p>The Pyrite Panel recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave.  The Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.</p><p>The Panel&rsquo;s report provided the overarching framework for the development of the and the ensuing pyrite remediation scheme.  The scheme&rsquo;s eligibility criteria are reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of that report.  I am satisfied that the Panel developed a reasonable and pragmatic approach to facilitate the remediation of dwellings exhibiting significant pyritic damage and that the conditions for entry into the pyrite remediation scheme are appropriate and proportionate.  In this regard, I have no proposals to carry out a review along the lines suggested.</p></reply>

Under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms. </p><p>In 2015, which was the first full year of the revised local government structures, a broadly based Advisory Group was convened to carry out a review of their operation, in conjunction with a Local Government Forum for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government.  Feedback from these deliberations and the results of surveys of local authority members and chief executives, indicate that the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully.  The results of this operational review will provide a key input to the consideration of issues in the preparation of a report for Government and the Oireachtas by mid-2017, pursuant to the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issue of town or borough council status.  Initial scoping work in relation to the development of proposals to address the requirements in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>is being undertaken in my Department. </p></reply>

The <i>Social Housing Strategy</i><i>2020</i>targets the delivery of 110,000 units for social housing purposes with 35,000 new units to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies, and 75,000 households to be supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.  The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link :. </p><p>While the units identified under the Strategy are coming on-stream a significant number of measures are being taken to address the incidence of homelessness.  These measures are identified in the <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>(May 2014) and in the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>(December 2014).  These Plans represent a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with homelessness.  The implementation of measures identified in these Plans is co-ordinated by my Department and is being overseen by a group of senior officials drawn from key State agencies concerned.  This group , which is chaired by my Department, includes the Department of Social Protection; the Department of Health; the Department of Children and Youth Affairs; the Health Service Executive; Tusla (the Child and Family Agency); the Irish Prison Service; and local authorities.  The Plans and quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the measures therein are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>In addition, the Government has committed to publishing an &lsquo;Action Plan for Housing&rsquo; within its first 100 days.  The Action Plan aims to address the challenges in the housing sector in a targeted and meaningful way, building on the considerable work already carried out or underway, including actions to expedite and boost supply of all types of housing, including social housing, in the immediate, medium and longer-terms, focusing in particular on those facing most difficulty in accessing the housing and rental market.  There will also be a focus on tackling, more quickly, the issue of those living in emergency accommodation, including households with dependents, by expanding and expediting solutions.  Importantly, it will also set out measures to prevent homelessness and keep people in their own homes as far as possible.</p></reply>

In broad terms, the standard sets out a two-step process to facilitate the testing and categorisation of dwellings.</p><p>The first step requires that a Building Condition Assessment be carried out; this comprises a desktop study and a visual non-invasive internal and external inspection of a dwelling to establish the presence or absence of visible damage that is consistent with pyritic heave and to quantify the extent and significance of such damage in that dwelling.  Damage ratings of 0, 1 or 2 can be assigned to a dwelling under this process.</p><p>The results of the Building Condition Assessment will inform whether the second step, i.e. sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore material, will be required in order to confirm the presence or otherwise of reactive pyrite.  Dwellings which have been tested and the hardcore is shown not to be susceptible to expansion are classified as Category A (i.e. green certificate).  These dwellings have a negligible risk of pyrite damage given that testing has demonstrated that the hardcore is not susceptible to expansion; any damage that may be visible in such dwellings is likely to be attributable to other causes.</p><p>My Department understands that the National Standards Authority of Ireland has commenced a review of I.S. 398-1:2013 in the light of practical experience since the standard was first introduced in January 2013.  This review is now at an advanced stage and a public consultation on proposed revisions to the standard is anticipated shortly.</p></reply>

The Housing Agency co-ordinates the operation of the scheme on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  The scheme has performed well for the 162 families that continue to live in their homes and are now secure in the knowledge that they can afford to remain there.  As at the end of May 2016, an additional 17 applications were with the lenders, who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information, and for the carrying out of an independent valuation. </p>  <p>  As part of the package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government in May 2015, a number of amendments to the MTR scheme were made with the objective of enabling more properties to qualify for the scheme and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  Amendments made with effect from July 2015 include: valuation thresholds for permissible properties were increased; households in marginal positive equity were permitted as eligible; and flexibility was introduced to allow households who may be over-accommodated in their current house to be permitted.  The funding available to approved housing bodies (AHBs) to purchase these units from lenders was also increased. </p>  <p>  Arising from these changes, an increasing number of applications for MTR are now being received from lenders.  This is likely due to the widening of the eligibility criteria but also is likely to arise because confidence and familiarity with the scheme is increasing on both the part of the lender and the borrower. </p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Housing Agency, meets regularly with representatives of the main lenders in relation to the scheme and are constantly seeking to ensure its effective operation. In addition, my Department works with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), the Citizens Information Bureau and the Departments of Justice and the Social Protection to ensure that the MTR is integrated in the communications with borrowers in mortgage difficulties. </p>  <p>  While there are, of course, continuing operational challenges for the MTR scheme, including that the scheme must be offered by a lender to a borrower, my Department is committed to keeping the scheme under ongoing review, with the objective of keeping families in their homes in so far as is possible. </p></reply>

To this end policies regarding all non-nationals wishing to enter the State are kept under review and revised from time to time.  As outlined in previous responses for Parliamentary Questions, I requested officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department to review the current policy position regarding the migration of non-EEA  retirees to Ireland.  That review is underway.  As part of the review process there will be a public consultation which will seek the views of stakeholders in relation to the review's recommendations.  </p>  <p>  Pending that, the current policy remains in force.  The criteria for persons wishing to retire in the state was reviewed in 2014 and a notice was placed on the website www.inis.gov.ie in March 2015 aimed at clarifying and standardising the terms and conditions in respect of applications from retired foreign nationals seeking to come and live in Ireland.  The key financial consideration in respect of a retiree is that the person must have sufficient and sustainable resources to ensure that they will not now, nor in the future become a burden on the State.  This is a fair and reasonable expectation on the part of the State and, in the case of retirees, the income level was set at &euro;50,000 per person per annum.  The applicant would also be expected to have a lump sum significant enough to cater for unforeseen circumstances, for example, health care and possible nursing home care in the future.   </p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division as appropriate.  </p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.</p><p>Greystones Garda Station lies in the Garda District of Bray, which in turn forms part of the Garda Division of Wicklow.  I have been informed by the Commissioner that the distribution of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Wicklow Division on 30 April 2016, the latest date for which figures are to hand, was as set out in the table.</p><p>The Wicklow Division is also  supported by 24 members of the Garda Reserve and 21 civilian staff.  All Divisional resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 300 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that so far this year 10 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Wicklow Garda Division.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th></th><th><div>Wicklow Garda Division 30 April 2016</div></th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td><div>Total</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALTINGLASS</td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLESSINGTON</td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARNEW</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNLAVIN</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHILLELAGH</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>BALTINGLASS            <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>TINAHELY</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALTINGLASS             Total</td><td><div>64</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRAY</td><td><div>119</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENNISKERRY</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GREYSTONES</td><td><div>26</div></td></tr><tr><td>BRAY                   <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>NEWTOWNMOUNTKENNEDY  </td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRAY                    Total</td><td><div>151</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ARKLOW</td><td><div>33</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ASHFORD</td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AUGHRIM</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AVOCA</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHDRUM</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROUNDWOOD</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW                <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>WICKLOW</td><td><div>43</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WICKLOW                 Total</td><td><div>96</div></td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW DIVISION TOTAL</td><td></td><td><div>311</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally. </p><p>The proposed legislation will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling.  In particular, the Scheme of the Bill envisages the establishment of a Fund to promote socially responsible gambling and to assist in counteracting the ill-effects of irresponsible gambling.  The purposes of the Fund may also include public education and awareness programmes, research and treatment programmes. </p><p>It would remain the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest feasible opportunity  and, in that light, I expect that this will be given renewed consideration in the preparation of the next legislation programme.  At the same time,  and pending the bringing forward of the main Bill,  I have also asked my Department to examine whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill<b><i>,</i></b>which could be dealt with sooner by separate legislative measures.</p></reply>

The aim of the Diversion Programme, through the network of Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs), is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the young offender away from the Courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The Programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and, at all times, pays the highest regard to the needs of victims.  The Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting children and young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to them and their families.This is evident from the continuing fall in the number of children and young people referred to the Programme in recent years.</p><p>The Programme is supported by my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) which funds and oversees over 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country.</p><p>GYDPs are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  The projects aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project.  The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of them remaining within the criminal justice system.</p><p>The funding to Garda Youth Diversion Projects in each of the years from 2006 to June 2016 is as follows:</p><p>2006- &euro;6.4m</p><p>2007- &euro;7.5m</p><p>2008- &euro;8.8m</p><p>2009- &euro;8.5m</p><p>2010- &euro;11.6m</p><p>2011- &euro;11.3m</p><p>2012- &euro;10.9m</p><p>2013- &euro;11.3m</p><p>2014 - &euro;11.3m</p><p>2015- &euro;11.3m</p><p>2016 - &euro;5.7m (June)</p><p>  The GYDPs are co-funded under the Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) of the European Social Fund Programme 2014-2020.  EU receipts totalling some &euro;6m are</p><p>anticipated in respect of expenditure in 2015. </p><p>Dormant Accounts funding has also been secured under the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Scheme 2013 &ndash; 2016 to support the GYDPs.  The IYJS received &euro;0.33m reimbursement from the Dormant Accounts Fund in respect of GYDP related expenditure in 2015 and has secured &euro;1.9m in Dormant Accounts funding in 2016 for the establishment of new GYDPs and providing additional support to existing GYDPs.</p></reply>

However, the Directive does not, at this time, explicitly provide for heated tobacco products.  Work is underway at EU level to amend the Directive to provide for a harmonised definition and tax treatment of heated tobacco products and officials are currently engaged in technical discussions at EU level in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that, while heated tobacco products are not currently available on the Irish market, in the event that they are introduced here before the Directive is amended, the current national tobacco tax provisions are sufficiently broad to ensure that they will fall to be taxed as smoking tobacco.</p>  <p>  On 28 August 2015, officials from my Department met with representatives of a tobacco company.  The issue of the excise treatment of new heated tobacco products was raised by the company representatives.  My officials referred them to the Revenue Commissioners for the clarification of the treatment of these products as set out above.  In this regard, Revenue officials meet regularly with the tobacco companies and with tobacco industry representatives to discuss administrative and operational issues around tobacco products tax.</p></reply>

Therefore, the condition of a property does not result in exemption from LPT where it is occupied.  The only exception in this regard is where a property is certified as having significant pyritic damage. </p>  <p>  Where a property is occupied and liable to LPT, it is up to the property owner to assess its market value on the relevant 'valuation date' (1 May 2013).  When doing so, the property owner should take account of any structural deficiencies that existed on that date.  The declared valuation then remains in place for the 'valuation period' (1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019) and is not affected by any subsequent repairs or improvements made to the property or by any general increase or decrease in property prices that might occur over the period. </p>  <p>  Because it is suitable for use as a dwelling house, Revenue has confirmed that the property in question is not entitled to an exemption from LPT and no further reduction is possible as the property owner has valued the property in the minimum band (Band 1).  Revenue has already confirmed the situation to the property owner on a number of occasions and has also clarified that it is obliged to administer LPT in accordance with the law as currently set down. </p></reply>

Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning.  Therefore my Department, in consultation with the representative school management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support school leaders and how their needs might be addressed.</p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals.  It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders.  This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles.  The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders.  Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals who are facing new challenges in the role, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards and the development of a quality assurance framework for leadership provision.  In addition my Department will shortly publish Looking at Our School 2016, a quality framework for schools which  is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 and as part of the 2,260 additional teaching posts announced in that budget, 250 posts were provided to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed from teaching time and be more fully available for leadership in schools.  Thus with effect from 01 September 2016, second level schools with over 400 students will receive an allocation that will bring those schools in line with the schools that have over 500 pupils where the Deputy Principal is fully freed up for leadership in the school.  A pro rata allocation of additional hours to support school leadership will also be provided to the schools with 400 or fewer students enrolled.  At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school.</p></reply>

ASTI's decision to withdraw from these hours is a serious issue that has implications beyond the question of whether these hours are fulfilled or not.  As I have stated previously, this decision means that ASTI is withdrawing from the Lansdowne Road Agreement. </p><p>These hours represent a real reform with real benefits for parents and children.  They facilitate staff meetings and parent teacher meetings without schools closing for half days.  They represent 33 extra hours per year, less than one hour per week.</p><p>In opting to withdraw from the Lansdowne Road Agreement, ASTI members are also opting to forego a series of benefits and protections, as communicated by my Department previously.  These include avoiding an increment freeze, continuation of the alleviation of the FEMPI Act 2013 pay cut for higher earners, the Supervision and Substitution payment of &euro;796 due to be paid on 1 September and protection against compulsory redundancy. </p><p>In regard to the increment freeze, the effect of the FEMPI legislation is that the freeze would be applied retrospectively with effect from 1 July 2013.  However, my intention is to seek a temporary modification to this from my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, so that the immediate impact of the increment freeze is prospective rather than retrospective.  </p><p>  A further significant consequence of withdrawing from the Lansdowne Road Agreement will be the withdrawal of the benefits introduced for new teachers under the Ward Report, which enable them to gain permanent employment and full hours more quickly than before.</p><p>I am aware of union concerns regarding the usage of the Croke Park hours.  In response to those concerns, my Department recently agreed with INTO and TUI that the usage would be reviewed, having regard to teacher professional judgement, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the utilisation of the hours.</p><p>ASTI have previously declined an open invitation to engage with my Department on this or other issues. </p><p>The Lansdowne Road Agreement provides stability, security and financial benefits for teachers.  The members of ASTI have exercised their democratic mandate and I respect their right to do so. </p><p>However, there are serious consequences for ASTI members in opting out of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  I would prefer that those consequences are avoided.  In my view, continuing cooperation with collective agreements offers financial and other benefits for teachers without compromising the legitimate right of their representatives to advance their case when successor agreements are negotiated.</p><p>With that in mind, I have again extended an invitation to ASTI to discuss issues of concern and I genuinely believe that it would be in the best interests of ASTI members and the school system as a whole for the union to engage with my Department on this.</p><p>I understand that ASTI issued a statement yesterday saying that they will be issuing a directive to their members to withdraw from the Croke Park hours, thereby repudiating the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  I am disappointed that the ASTI has chosen to repudiate the agreement.  However, I also understand that the union has indicated that they will accept my invitation to talk, and I hope this will give the union and my Department the opportunity for a constructive exchange of views on matters of mutual concern. </p><p>My Department is currently putting arrangements in place for implementation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement for teachers represented by unions that have accepted the Agreement.  These arrangements are currently being finalised and my Department will publish a Circular in early July to notify teachers and the system in general.</p></reply>

The teachers involved are benefiting from extensive continuing professional development and are availing of professional time to support the implementation.  The ASTI continue to operate a directive of non-cooperation with the framework.  The effect of this is that ASTI teachers are not participating in the continuing professional development that is available to all teachers of junior cycle and are not co-operating with the delivery of class-room based assessments.  This is impacting on current first year and second year students of English who are taught by ASTI member teachers.  The Department is continuing to work with the management bodies and other partners in addressing ongoing implementation matters.  In fact, in March 2016 the Department issued a circular to school management on the "Arrangement for the Implementation of the Framework for Junior cycle with particular reference to school years 2015/ 2016 and 2016/ 2017."  The Circular provides detailed data to supplement that which was provided in the Framework for Junior Cycle published in August 2015 and in addition it provides details on the extra resources and supports available to schools and teachers.</p>  <p>  The position of ASTI in relation to continuing non-cooperation is unsustainable, unjustified and unfair on the teachers and students involved.  I met with ASTI recently and had an exchange of views in relation to junior cycle.  I am committed to the continuing implementation of the framework and have told ASTI that I am willing to engage with them to discuss their implementation concerns and to provide any further clarifications that they require.  ASTI are aware that I would welcome further engagement on this matter and I hope that they will agree to this.</p></reply>

The scale of these shortages varies and there can be a variety of reasons that impact on the ability of employers to recruit.</p>  <p>  The work of the SLMRU provides valuable input in terms of labour market research and is a critical component in the annual service planning process, that takes between SOLAS and each of the 16 ETBs in preparing the annual Further Education and Training service plans, so as to inform education and training provision to meet the identified skill needs of learners, employers and enterprise, across all sectors and on a national and regional basis.</p>  <p>  My Department launched a new National Skills Strategy to 2025 in January, to provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland's growth both economically and societally over the next decade.  Through the vision, objectives, actions and indicators outlined, the Strategy will support the development of a well-educated, well-skilled and adaptable labour force, creating and sustaining a strong pool of talented people of all ages throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Strategy's vision and objectives focus on relevant, high quality education and training provision with continuous evaluation; strong employer participation in skills development and use of skills in their organisations to drive productivity and competitiveness; support for lifelong learning; active inclusion to support participation in education and training and the labour market and increasing the supply of skills to the labour market.</p>  <p>  It sets out the elements of a new skills architecture which seeks to foster close collaboration between relevant Government Departments and agencies and develop structures to strengthen engagement between the education and training system and enterprise.  It provides for establishment of the National Skills Council to provide a mechanism to mediate demands across the full range of needs identified through the research and analysis conducted under its direction and by the new network of nine Regional Skills Fora. </p>  <p>  The skills needs of the economy are met from both mainstream Further and Higher Education and Training provision as well as through targeted programmes such as Momentum and Springboard.   In recent years, higher education enrolments have continued to increase throughout the economic crisis.  Numbers have increased from 196,000 in 2011/12 to around 210,000 in 2014/15.  Within the Further Education and Training sector, a range of flexible high quality provision will be made available for almost 340,000 beneficiaries in 2016, with provision including new career traineeships in areas such as hospitality and engineering and new programmes in IT, entrepreneurship, information technology, manufacturing and business and finance.</p>  <p>  As part of the Springboard programme, between 2011 and 2015, 30,000 free places have been provided on 1,000 programmes in disciplines related to high growth areas in the economy. Springboard+ 2016, which incorporates the ICT skills conversion programme, is providing nearly 6,000 free higher education places for jobseekers who wish to upskill or reskill in areas where there are identified skills needs.  These include ICT, manufacturing, international financial services and entrepreneurship.</p>  <p>  Following on from a comprehensive review of the Irish apprenticeship system, a major initiative is also underway to reform and expand apprenticeship.  The content of existing apprenticeships is being modernised, with new curricula being rolled out in five of the most popular trades and a curriculum review underway in the remaining trades.  A new Apprenticeship Council has been established that is prioritising the development of 25 new apprenticeships in areas such as ICT, financial services, transport and tourism and hospitality.  These new apprenticeships are being progressed following the evaluation of responses to a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  This expansion of apprenticeship will provide new options for school leavers as well as for those seeking to reskill or upskill in the labour market.  In the Programme for Partnership Government we have committed to double the number of apprenticeships by 2020, together with the Apprenticeship Council, SOLAS, the ETBs and with Industry and to target 100 different apprenticeship schemes spread across sectors of the economy and in every region of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Given the scale of demand for ICT skills, my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation launched a revised Government/Industry ICT Skills Action Plan in 2014.  The Plan takes a comprehensive approach including increases in high-level graduate output, enhancing awareness of ICT as a career among students, maintaining a strong talent pool and promoting Ireland as a destination for ICT talent.  Implementation of the plan is being overseen by a high-level steering group shared by the two departments and including representatives from industry and the education system, and delivery teams have been set up to progress areas of work set out under the plan.  ICT graduate output from the higher education sector has increased significantly since the first ICT plan was published in 2011.</p>  <p>  Under the umbrella of Springboard+, ICT conversion courses are also open to a wide cohort of applicants given the priority in this area.  This year, for the first time, two-year part time ICT Conversion Courses are also being made available on a pilot basis, to enable people who are unable to commit to a full-time course, the opportunity to reskill in this area.  Employment outcomes for Springboard graduates are very strong and further information on outcomes is available in the trend analysis reports published on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The use of school facilities must be approved by the school authority.  In 2005, my Department issued a circular to Trustees, Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Voluntary Secondary Schools (Circular Letter Prim 16/05) to encourage Trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community, education and recreation purposes.  This circular recognises that the decision ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.</p><p>  In facilitating such extra provision there are a number of complex issues that need to be considered in respect of such arrangements.  These issues - including property, governance, insurance and liability - are being considered as part of a review within my Department of the requirements to be established around the use of school premises/property for pre-school and after school services and the preparation of guidelines in relation to same.  In that regard, a cross-departmental group is also meeting regularly to assess the following:  </p><p>- Capacity and demand for services</p><p>- Children's views on afterschool care</p><p>- An appropriate quality and standards framework</p><p>- The development of criteria for the capital scheme to be funded by DCYA under Budget 2016</p><p>- Estimated existing use of school buildings</p><p>- Collaborative models with existing community/private service providers</p><p>- Potential funding incentives for provision of services.</p></reply>

They include:</p><p>- Supporting school leadership</p><p>- Networks and clusters for DEIS teachers and schools</p><p>- Teaching methodologies</p><p>- Exploring ways in which the work of schools could be better integrated with other state supports within the community, and</p><p>- In consultation with Minister Zappone, making greater use of Home School Community Liaison.</p><p>I intend that innovative measures such as these, which are shown to work well in improving results for disadvantaged children and students, can form pilot schemes under a new schools support programme.</p><p>  The number of additional schools to be included in the new programme will be determined by a new identification process for this purpose, which is currently in development and all schools will be assessed.  Therefore, there will not be a requirement for an application process.  Subject to Government approval, it is intended to begin to implement actions arising from an updated plan in the 2017/18 school year.</p><p>  In the meantime, I do not propose to make any changes to the current programme, including the addition of further schools until the completion of the Review and agreement on a new Action Plan.</p></reply>

These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.</p><p>  There are limited alleviation arrangements in place for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level.  These arrangements are mainly focused at post-primary level.  However, it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed.</p><p>  It is widely accepted that the quality of school leadership is a key determinant of school effectiveness and the achievement of good learning outcomes.  Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning.  Therefore my Department, in consultation with the representative school management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support school leaders and how their needs might be addressed.</p><p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals.  It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders.  This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles. </p><p>  The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders.  Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals who are facing new challenges in the role, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards and the development of a quality assurance framework for leadership provision. </p><p>  In addition my Department will shortly publish Looking at Our School 2016, a quality framework for schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. </p><p>  In Budget 2016 and as part of the 2,260 additional teaching posts announced in that budget, 250 posts were provided to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed from teaching time and be more fully available for leadership in schools.  Thus with effect from 01 September 2016, second level schools with over 400 students will receive an allocation that will bring those schools in line with the schools that have over 500 pupils where the Deputy Principal is fully freed up for leadership in the school.  A pro rata allocation of additional hours to support school leadership will also be provided to the schools with 400 or fewer students enrolled.  At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school.</p></reply>

The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.  Progress on the divestment process has, in recent years, been slower than might have been hoped.  However, by developing new approaches I am convinced that we can significantly increase the rate of progress.  The Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to facilitate this process and I am progressing these matters as a priority.</p>  <p>  In relation to the new schools which will open in 2016 under the patronage divesting process, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a new multidenominational primary school will open in Greenhills, Dublin, in September 2016 under this process.  My Department and representatives of the Dublin Archdiocese and of the local parish have agreed that a former school building in which St. Peters Boys' National School, Limekiln Road, Greenhills was located, will be made available to the Department for educational use.  My Department and Archdiocese representatives have worked, and continue to work, very closely on the practicalities of the property issues involved in advance of this school opening from the start of the coming school year 2016/17.  My Department is also liaising closely with the patron of the new school, Educate Together, in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department is also continuing to work very closely with Mayo County Council in order to make a Council-owned property in Castlebar, which is currently vacant, available to my Department for educational use under the divesting process.  This will facilitate a new multi-denominational primary school opening under the patronage of Educate Together for the start of the coming school year.</p></reply>

The report on the 2015 Lifeskills survey is currently being finalised and will be available shortly.  Analysis so far indicates that the high level of implementation of strategies regarding substance misuse remains.</p>  <p>  My Department is making a significant contribution to the implementation of the current National Drugs Strategy, primarily through the delivery of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum in schools.  The Department is also represented on the key national structures that oversee implementation of the Strategy including the Oversight Forum on Drugs and the National Coordinating Committee for Drug and Alcohol Taskforces and the Education and Training Boards are represented on the relevant Local Drug and Alcohol Taskforces.</p>  <p>  SPHE, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances, is currently mandatory in all primary schools and at junior cycle level in post primary schools.  Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p>  <p>  The Department's Inspectorate, including dedicated SPHE inspectors at post-primary level, visit SPHE lessons and provide support and advice to teachers and schools.  In recent years, the Inspectorate published two composite reports which provide insights into the effectiveness of the teaching of SPHE at primary and post-primary level.  At primary level, the report published in 2009 drew from forty inspections of the teaching of SPHE.  At post-primary level, the report published in 2013, drew from sixty-three inspections at post-primary level which focused on Junior Cycle SPHE and Senior Cycle Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE).  Within these reports, inspectors describe the overall quality of subject provision and whole-school support for SPHE as very good or good in most schools.  In response to questionnaires in these schools, 84% of students strongly agreed that SPHE helped them to understand the reasons for substance misuse, and 90% of students strongly agreed that SPHE helped them to understand the effects of abuse on individuals.</p></reply>

This programme is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless households accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements.  The units will provide emergency accommodation for those families currently in hotels in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.</p>  <p>  An initial 22 units have been delivered and occupied in Poppintree, Ballymun and another 131 units are expected for completion in the Dublin City Council area by the end of this year.  In addition, 44 units are to be delivered in the Fingal County Council area by the end of this year.  A further 305 units will be provided in 2017 across the four Dublin authorities, the bulk of which will be delivered in the early part of the year.  A procurement framework, overseen by the Office for Government Procurement, will be in place by September and will be available all local authorities for the procurement of rapid-delivery housing.</p></reply>

There are 80,000 social homes to be tackled in that phase and to end-2015, some 46,000 homes have been retrofitted, with further good progress anticipated under that phase in 2016.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 of the programme will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction, of which there are 28,000 homes.  This phase has commenced on a pilot basis in both Fingal and Westmeath local authorities in 2015 and the outcome of this pilot work will inform the full national roll-out of Phase 2 across all local authorities.</p></reply>

The aim of the SICAP is to reduce poverty, and promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.  SICAP is a key priority of Government and its vision is to improve the life chances and opportunities of those who are marginalised in society, living in poverty or in unemployment, through community development approaches, targeted supports and interagency collaboration, where the values of equality and inclusion are promoted and human rights are respected.  Community development is an integral part of SICAP and underpins the entire programme.  There is a strong focus on community activation, social inclusion and community development, in addition to prioritisation of those most hard to reach in our communities.  The SICAP budget for 2016 is &euro;37.5 million.  This includes an allocation of &euro;3 million under the European Structural Funds (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020. </p>  <p>  The programme&rsquo;s target groups are children and families from disadvantaged areas, lone parents, new communities (including refugees, asylum seekers), people living in disadvantaged communities, people with disabilities, Roma, the unemployed (including those not on the Live Register), Travellers, low income workers/households, young unemployed people from disadvantaged areas and young people aged 15-24 who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs).</p>  <p>  SICAP is delivered locally by programme implementers who operate a range of community schemes and programmes, and is being overseen and managed by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.  Each LCDC is mandated with bringing a more joined-up and coherent approach to the local management of public-funded programmes in the areas of economic, social and community development, including SICAP.  The primary means through which this will be achieved will be the development and implementation of the community elements of the Local Economic and Community Plans, which have been developed in each Local Authority area.  These six year plans will look to coordinate the delivery of community supports within their area.  The primary focus of my Department is to ensure that front-line services, particularly those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities, are protected.  The Programme for Government includes provisions for the development of a new Community Development Scheme for rural areas as well as the reactivation of and increase in funding to RAPID.  My Department will collaborate with other stakeholders including LCDCs and Local Authorities in addressing this commitment.   </p>  <p>  Insofar as rural areas are concerned, lead responsibility for rural development, including the LEADER programme, rests with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

Using the &euro;30 million available to local authorities for town and village regeneration from this year, it is envisaged that the scheme will, among other things, particularly seek to increase the attractiveness and sustainability of our towns and villages as places to live and work. </p><p>In addition to this new Scheme, it is also intended under the new <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>to examine a series of further initiatives, including:</p><p>-  the introduction of a similar scheme to the &lsquo;Living City Initiative&rsquo; to regenerate urban centres and villages throughout Ireland (Year 1 action),</p><p>-  reclassifying and incentivising the use of underutilised or vacant areas over ground floor premises in urban areas, for both residential and commercial use (Year 1 action), </p><p>-  examining the scope to reform the Derelict Sites Act to tackle the under-use and hoarding of derelict land by the State, semi-State and private sectors (Year 1 action), </p><p>-  the establishment of a national register of derelict sites, in addition to the new vacant site levy, to bring vacant and underutilised sites into beneficial use for housing and urban regeneration purposes (Year 2 action), and</p><p>-  the mandating of local authorities with better land management powers (Year 2 action).</p><p>In the context of the priority being attached to urban regeneration by the current Government, I will be aiming to provide increased funding in 2017 and beyond for a range of measures that will address deep-rooted disadvantage, while simultaneously developing an approach to urban regeneration that empowers people to work together to improve their communities, to reduce poverty, disadvantage and inequality.  It is intended that these new measures will also include strengthening the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) as well as reactivating funding to areas covered by the RAPID (Revitalising Areas through Planning, Investment and Development) Programme through the local authorities.</p></reply>

The Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, which establishes a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol from 2013 to 2020, was agreed in 2012 but has not yet entered into force.  Ireland has completed the necessary domestic acceptance procedures in relation to the Doha Amendment.  However, it has been decided that the European Union, its Member States and Iceland should formally accept the Doha Amendment simultaneously, on a date yet to be fixed.  Ireland stands ready to formally accept the Doha Amendment as and when this date is agreed.</p><p>On 12th December 2015, an ambitious new legally binding, global agreement on climate change was agreed in Paris.  The Paris Agreement puts in place the necessary framework for all countries to take ambitious action as well as providing for a transparency system to ensure that ensures all countries can have confidence in each other&rsquo;s efforts.  The Agreement sets out a long- term goal to put the world on track to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.  It should be noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been tasked with evaluating what will be the specific policy implications of this goal with a special report to be published in 2018.</p><p>The Agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the INDC tabled by the EU on behalf of Member States which commits to 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.  The specific details of the contribution to this 40% to be made by each Member State remain to be defined and will be announced as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy package in due course.</p><p>At an EU level, f or each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) No. 406/2009/EC.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) produces national GHG emission projections on an annual basis.  The latest projections, published in March 2016, projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6-11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis, Ireland will have a deficit of between 4 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e).  The projections suggest that Ireland may have a cumulative deficit of units in 2018 or 2019.</p><p>The extent of this challenge to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015</i>which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.</p><p>It should be noted that the overall outcome of the Paris Conference means that the long-term objective that Ireland has also established in the National Policy Position, and that is now underpinned by the Act, namely to pursue substantial decarbonisation of the energy, transport and built environment sectors, as well as pursuing neutrality in the land sector, will now be undertaken within a broader international context. </p><p>This means that the more ambitious actions that will be required over time can be taken on the basis of shared experience and co-operation with other States and regions, in the knowledge that all countries will be moving in the same direction, crucial for a small open economy like Ireland&rsquo;s that competes in global markets.</p><p>In addition, and cognisant of the need to safeguard our economic recovery, there will, and must be, a strong economic dimension to the work that Ireland is carrying out to transition to a low carbon, environmentally sustainable economy, as Ireland&rsquo;s finances continue to stabilise and recover.  The National Policy Position clearly identifies competitiveness as a pillar of the fundamental national objective on transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050 and in this context sets out a number of key issues for consideration in the on-going evolution of national climate policy, including</p><p>-  the need to ensure that objectives are achieved at the least cost to the national economy and that any measures adopted to achieve those objectives are cost-effective, and do not impose an unreasonable burden on the Exchequer, and </p><p>-  the need to take advantage of environmentally sustainable economic opportunities both within and outside the State.</p><p>The Act statutorily underpins these and other key economic considerations, to be taken into account in the development of the mitigation and adaptation plans to be adopted by the Government for the purpose of progressing the national transition agenda.  We must therefore look for economic opportunities in the low carbon transition process with policies to be adopted ideally being a spur to sustainable economic growth.</p><p>In terms of putting in place a plan to manage our transition to a low carbon economy, in accordance with Section 4 of the Act, a National Mitigation Plan will be submitted to Government for approval by June 2017 at the latest.  Work is well underway on the development of this Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.</p><p>The ultimate objective of successive 5-yearly National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this low-carbon transition vision by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 Climate and Energy Package.</p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.  The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 31 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.</p><p>The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, primarily based on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive.  The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2014 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality</i>, was published in September 2015 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2014, compared to the CAF&Eacute; Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health and the European Environment Agency (EEA) estimated reference levels.</p><p>The report indicates that NO <sub>x</sub>values, arising primarily from the transport sector, are showing a slight increase over 2013 figures at some locations, and indicates a risk that growth in economic activity will lead to an increase in NO <sub>x</sub>levels.  Similarly, the report indicates that levels of particulates (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and compounds (PAH) have increased at some stations.</p><p>Notwithstanding these points, I welcome the fact that no levels above the EU limit value were recorded at any of the ambient air quality network monitoring sites in Ireland in 2014.  Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in some areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted.  Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns can often be similar to, or higher than, those in cities where the sale and use of smoky coal is banned.  To help protect our good air quality, consumers must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that this choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.</p><p>In relation to the monitoring of water quality, pursuant to the Water Framework Directive, the EPA monitors surface waters, including rivers, lakes, estuarine and coastal waters, as well as groundwater.  Under this monitoring programme, the EPA assesses general physico-chemical parameters (nutrients, oxygen, temperature, salinity) and biological quality elements (phytoplankton, macro -algae and angiosperms).  On-the- ground sampling is conducted by local authorities, and operational and surveillance samples are then brought to EPA laboratories.</p><p>The findings from the monitoring programme are detailed in the EPA&rsquo;s <i>Water Quality in Ireland</i>reports.  The most recent report covers the period from 2010 to 2012 and is available on the EPA website at: -</p><p> </p><p>The aforementioned report contains an overview of water quality and, in summary, notes that 53% of rivers, 43% of lakes, 45% of transitional waters, 93% of coastal waters and 99% of groundwater were satisfactory at good or high status.  There was a 4% increase in high or good condition (73%) river channels based on the biological Q-value assessments.  Serious pollution of rivers reduced to 17 km from 53 km since the last reporting period (2007-2009).  Reported fish kills declined to an all-time low of 70 recorded between 2010 and 2012.  There was a 5% reduction in satisfactory quality lakes (10 lakes).  Water quality in canals remains very high at over 90% satisfactory.  The south and south-east of the country continue to have the greatest proportion of groundwater and rivers with nitrogen concentrations over 10 mg/l NO<sub>3</sub>.  Although there was a decrease in detections of faecal coliforms in groundwater from 61% in 2008 to 51% in 2012, these levels highlight a risk for drinking water in areas where there is inadequate treatment.  Approximately 35% of the designated shellfish areas were non-compliant with the guide value for Escherichia coli. </p><p>A new national update on water quality for the period from 2013 to 2015 will be available later this year.</p></reply>

In 2016, &euro;6.976 billion will be spent on pensions, which represents 35% of the Department's total current expenditure.  While expenditure on pensions is increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every five years because of demographic pressures, this is being successfully managed within the overall welfare budget.  A number of significant reforms to State pensions were introduced in recent years which have allowed my Department maintain the value of the State pension, and indeed increase it in Budget 2016.</p>  <p>  From September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension contributory were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contributed to the Social Insurance Fund more frequently during their working life will, generally, benefit more in retirement than those who made less frequent contributions.  People who qualify for a lower contributory pension as a result, but who have an income need, may still claim the means-tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension contributory.  At the time this measure was introduced, the net exchequer savings arising were estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.8 million in 2013, &euro;5m in 2014 and &euro;8m in 2015, rising as the number of new claimants, assessed under the new rates, entered the system.  While a projection was not made at that time for 2017, a figure of some &euro;14 million might be expected to apply using a similar rate of increase.</p>  <p>  To provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, the Government decided to increase State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66. This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  This process saw the abolition of the State Pension Transition payment from 2014. In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseekers Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, there are others who would not make a social welfare claim during that year (most notably those who continue in employment).  Therefore, it is anticipated that over half of the cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, and (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;75-80 million.</p>  <p>  With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.  At the time this measure was introduced, the annual exchequer savings were expected to be in the region of &euro;6m per annum.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions.</p>  <p>  Any significant measures that would increase the cost of the State pension would have to be considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In response to these concerns, Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provided that a payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social Protection by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as being an area of regeneration.  An amendment to an area of regeneration is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>  <p>  The measures provided for in Section 25 are not a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration. Specific provision is made to ensure that: </p>  <p>-  people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment; and </p>  <p>-  people already residing in such areas in private rental accommodation and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future would not have their entitlement restricted. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 853,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;80 million. </p>  <p>  In 2012, during a period of economic uncertainty, my Department along with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, set up an interdepartmental working group to review the free travel scheme.  The purpose of the review was to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme.  Owing to the range of policy changes implemented since its establishment, the scheme is now universally available to all persons permanently living in the State aged 66 and over as well as carers in receipt of carers allowance and certain others such as persons in receipt of disability allowance and invalidity pension. </p>  <p>  The group&rsquo;s report was drafted by October 2014, and it considered a number of potential changes to the free travel scheme, notably options which would reduce its cost by limiting its scope or by the introduction of charges.  However, Government policy is strongly supportive of the scheme, and by late 2014 the economy had started to recover and the need to make cost saving changes in respect of this scheme abated.  The subsequent publication of the report might have been seen to signal the intention to actively pursue some of the options identified, and would have caused anxiety among vulnerable users of the service.  The report drafted was not, therefore, submitted for Government approval and publication.   </p>  <p>  I am aware that the free travel pass is a valuable support for older people and people with disabilities, and I am committed to its full retention.</p>  <p>  With respect to the cap on funding imposed by a previous Government under the National Recovery Plan, 2011-2014, the cap on funding was not extended beyond 2014 and in Budget 2016 an additional &euro;3 million in funding was allocated to the free travel scheme. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department, at the request of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, intend to carry out a Value for Money review of the JST scheme and this is due to be completed during 2017.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that in Budget 2016 OFP recipients gained a 75% Christmas bonus, a &euro;5 increase in Child Benefit and an increase of &euro;2.50 per week in fuel allowance.  Those in receipt of that family income supplement (FIS) also benefitted from the increases to the FIS thresholds.  Lone parents on JST also gained as a result of the closer alignment of the JST means test with the more generous OFP means test.</p>  <p>  My Department published a social impact assessment of the main social welfare and tax measures of Budget 2015 and 2016.  The assessment found that the cumulative impact of these budgets on lone parent households fared above that of the average household.  The assessment indicated that average income in households where the lone parent is employed will rise by 2.8 per cent, while that of unemployed lone parents will rise by 2.4 per cent.</p></reply>

This is a lower number than the national figure, reflecting minor differences in the income concept and the equivalence scale between the measures.

A comparable OECD figure for 2014 is not available.  </p><p>Social transfers are a key driver in preventing poverty among children.  In 2014, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the relative poverty rate for children in Ireland from 44.3% to 17% lifting more than a quarter of all children out of income poverty.

The JobPath element of the service is a new approach to employment activation designed to support long-term unemployed people and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment.  My Department has contracted two companies, Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited, to deliver JobPath services.   </p>  <p>  The roll-out of the service commenced on the 20th of July 2015 on a phased basis and the service is now fully rolled out to all 121 Departmental offices.  To date c. 38,000 jobseekers have been referred to the JobPath service.  Only clients in receipt of a jobseeker payment are referred to JobPath.  Clients in receipt of a disability payment are not referred to JobPath.</p>  <p>  JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies.  Payments are made on a phased basis over a 12 month period in respect of each jobseeker placed into sustained employment.  Accordingly the contractors will not be able to fully recover their costs unless they help a sufficient number of jobseekers to secure employment and then support them to sustain that employment over a 12 month period. </p>  <p>  The contracts are for six years comprising two consecutive phases, (phase one entails four years of client referrals while phase two entails a &lsquo;run off&rsquo; period during which time no additional clients will be referred).  The contracts include options to extend phase one for further periods (up to a maximum of 24 months) at the department&rsquo;s discretion.   </p>  <p>  The contracts stipulate a significant number of obligations that both companies are required to meet, for example, in terms of the service elements to be delivered and the performance to be achieved.  The delivery of these obligations is subject to on-going review and monitoring by the department, including on-site checks and inspections and a customer satisfaction survey to be undertaken by a third party research firm commissioned by the Department.  Payments to contractors can be reduced if these inspections and surveys do not yield satisfactory results.  Payments can also be reduced if the contractors do not meet their contracted targets with regard to employment outcomes, and if employment growth in the economy exceeds the medium term forecasts of the Department of Finance.  Failure by the contractors to improve performance (if they are not meeting contracted target levels for employment outcomes) or to address any service deficiencies identified in the inspections and surveys mentioned above can lead to termination of the contracts.</p>  <p>  It is not intended to publish the individual fees agreed with the JobPath contractors as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes issues relating to the border and EU funding.  During such negotiations we would actively seek to avoid the introduction of any new measures that could negatively impact on the Border region, either North or South. </p>  <p>  It is important to underline that we do not envisage any immediate changes to EU funded Cooperation Programmes involving Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  These include the current round of PEACE and INTERREG Programmes under the European Regional Development Fund which are managed on a North-South basis by the Special EU Programmes Body, which reports to the North-South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  On the specific issue of the operation of the European Court of Human Rights, the UK remains a party to the European Convention of Human Rights under which the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe are established.  This Convention system is separate and distinct to the European Union, and the referendum result has no impact on the UK&rsquo;s participation in that system.</p>  <p>  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing obligation.</p>  <p>  The Government has underlined this obligation in the context of British Government proposals to repeal the UK Human Rights Act, which incorporates the ECHR into domestic law and will continue to monitor the situation closely. </p>  <p>  As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles including in the area of human rights.  We will continue to work closely with the UK Government and with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

However, it is too early as yet to identify the precise impact of the outcome in terms of the volume of passport applications.  Statistics relating to applications are usually compiled on a monthly basis.</p>  <p>  I would like to underline that there is no need for concern in terms of freedom of movement or entitlement to an Irish passport.  The process of negotiation to enable the United Kingdom to leave the European Union is likely to take two years as envisaged under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and once the article is triggered.  During this period, the United Kingdom remains a member of the European Union, and its citizens continue to enjoy full rights including freedom of movement within the EU.  At the same time, the referendum has not in any way changed the entitlement to an Irish passport including as it extends to those people born on the island of Ireland and those with Irish citizenship through parents or grandparents born in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I would urge people who have concerns about freedom of movement within the European Union and those who are interested in applying for an Irish passport for the first time to get the full facts and research their particular situation before contacting the Passport Service.  Full information on passport entitlements and procedures is available on the website of the Department at www.dfa.ie.</p>  <p>  First-time applicants might also keep in mind that this is peak season and unless a passport is needed for urgent travel reasons the timing of an application should be considered.  </p>  <p>  My Department will closely monitor the situation with respect to the impact of the referendum outcome on the level of applications for Irish passports.  Passport Service staff and other resources will be re-deployed as needed to deal with an increase in applications, if sustained.</p></reply>

As I have said, I believe the health service would benefit enormously from a single unifying vision that we can all get behind and that can help to drive reform and development of the system over the next ten years.  I'm pleased that the House agreed to move ahead quickly on this and get the committee up and running.  We all know that the health service faces many challenges.  The Programme for Partnership Government acknowledges that we have an ageing population who are living longer, whose needs will become greater and more diverse, and that we also have the highest birth rate in Europe.  All of us, as citizens, at some point in our lives, will need to access our health services, and so we have a common interest in finding a common way forward in improving and developing our health services.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange health services for themselves and their dependants. </p><p>I can clarify to the Deputy that the legislation does not have a provision for the HSE to award a medical card to persons by virtue of an illness or a medical condition.  However, where an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the qualifying financial thresholds, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility,</i>which made a recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.</p><p>Following the Keane report, the Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) on medical card eligibility was established by the Director General of the HSE to provide clinical oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system which can strive to ensure that the relatively small percentage of cases requiring the recognition of the burden of a medical condition(s), over and above financial hardship, can be accommodated.  The Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.</p><p>As a result of a range of improvements on foot of the Keane Report, the HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by about 102% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to 106,174 at 1 June 2016.</p></reply>

As a Private Members Bill, however, it did not form part of the Government's legislative programme.  The Oireachtas has advised that all Private Members legislation has fallen following the dissolution of the D&aacute;il. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is important to note that the Government is already committed under the National Disability Strategy (NDS) to ensuring that people with autism are empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society.  The NDS is driven by this basic but fundamentally important objective and is the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has been examining issues around autism across Government Departments in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  This work by the NDA, which has included consultation with families, has been of significant assistance in informing how best to address the needs of people with ASD, so that we can be sure that they are appropriately reflected and included in policies and actions.  The proposed approach was also discussed with the National Disability Strategy Steering Group.</p>  <p>  A programme of specific measures has now been agreed for delivery by the relevant Government Departments and agencies, including actions to be delivered by the NDA.</p></reply>

There is no legal obligation under the Act for the HSE to publish the public cost of care.  </p>  <p>  Over the past number of years the cost of care for public nursing homes under the Scheme as published on the HSE website has not been updated as the HSE was undergoing a process to review all costs associated with both long stay and short stay care services provided in public facilities.  This work was acknowledged in the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which was published by the Department of Health in July 2015.  The HSE will, however, publish the cost of care for public residential care centres in September 2016 as part of a process to provide additional information on its services to the public.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that more complex and highly dependent residents are catered for by the public system whereby private nursing homes may not have the available skillset and multidisciplinary personnel to cater for such complex needs.  From an acute hospital discharge perspective the challenge to find suitable placements for those with more complex needs is often resolved in public centres where nurse staffing levels in particular can cater for their needs.</p>  <p>  In addition, conditions of employment and tenure differ between private and public residential care facilities.  Negotiations relating to the review of costs referred to by the Deputy, as mentioned in a reply to a Parliamentary Question in February 2015, have extended longer than anticipated.  As part of the process to review and bring consistency to pay costs in public facilities, the HSE has been engaged in extensive negotiations with staff organisations to agree consistent staffing levels and mix in public centres.  To date it has not been possible to get agreement despite extensive discussions under the auspices of the Haddington Road Agreement and the Joint Oversight Group.  The HSE is now considering its options to focus on those centres with a higher cost of care and will also continue to strive to reach an overall framework agreement with the staff representative organisations.</p>  <p>  It is important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible, and towards that end the Department of Health will conduct a Value for Money Review of public nursing home costs to identify more fully the factors that may be increasing costs and any areas that require correction.</p>  <p>  I am not aware of any breaches of competition law arising in this context.</p></reply>

This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more for health insurance than the young and healthy.  Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) came into effect on 1 May 2015 and is designed to encourage people to join the private health insurance market at an earlier age and thus support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance.  Late entry loadings of 2% per annum now apply for people who buy health insurance for the first time at the age of 35 and older. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of LCR, an insured person must have a continuous period of cover under an in-patient indemnity health insurance contract effected by a registered undertaking.  The arrangements in place for Commissioned Officers in the Defence Forces, which include the reimbursement of fees incurred when members require medical treatment, do not fulfil the definition of a health insurance contract provided by a registered undertaking.  The arrangements do not comply with health insurance legislation or the key principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and minimum benefit on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. </p>  <p>  Section 7 of S.I. 312 of 2014, the enabling legislation for Lifetime Community Rating, explicitly provides for a review of the Scheme to be carried out by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) after 30 April 2017.  This review will provide the appropriate opportunity to consider the wider implications of LCR and address any issues that may arise from the operation of the Scheme as currently provided in the Regulations.  My Department has shared the details of previous discussions with the Department of Defence on this matter with the HIA and will continue to highlight any concerns raised for consideration as part of its planned independent review of the Regulations in 2017.</p></reply>

The first of these, HIQA&rsquo;s review of NAS governance arrangements, was published in December 2014.  The second, the NAS Capacity review, which examined overall resource levels and the distribution of resources against demand and activity, was published recently.  The third review, an independent review of services in the greater Dublin area, was jointly commissioned by the HSE and Dublin City Council; this review is expected to be completed shortly. </p>  <p>  An action plan addressing the recommendations of the HIQA and Capacity reviews is currently being implemented.  On completion of the Dublin service review the action plan will be updated, as appropriate. </p>  <p>  The Capacity Review makes it clear that we need a very significant programme of investment in our ambulance services.  In that context, a phased investment in a multi-annual programme involving manpower, vehicles and technology is required.  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Partnership Government commits to additional annual investment in terms of ambulance personnel and vehicles.  In 2016, additional funding of &euro;7.2m has been provided for the NAS which includes &euro;2m for new developments.  </p>  <p>  The Capacity Review identifies particular difficulties serving rural areas.  Population density in Ireland is significantly different to that of many other countries.  Outside the greater Dublin area, the population is widely dispersed with a relatively large population living in rural areas.  Because of this population distribution, Ireland has a far higher percentage of activity in rural areas than other ambulance services.</p>  <p>  The report recommends expansion of the Community First Responders (CFR) scheme as a means to address the needs of rural communities.  This had also been recommended in the 2014 HIQA report.  The Deputy may wish to note that the CFR scheme has been expanded in recent years and currently 135 groups are operating in 18 counties nationally.  Additional funding of &euro;0.3m has been provided in 2016 for further expansion of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  In relation to support from the Fire Services, the position is that a significant degree of co-operation already exists between the NAS and the Fire Services in providing an emergency first responder service.  However, there may be scope to further utilise fire services as a first responder for certain types of calls, where this is warranted.  This will be explored with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and local authorities.</p></reply>

One of my priorities is to support the provision of lower-cost, more flexible finance for the sector.  Access to finance was discussed at the Dairy Forum on 21 June, with an exchange of views with the main banks now a part of the agenda at each meeting.  Before the meeting I formally launched the Dairy Forum&rsquo;s &rsquo;Financial Management Initiative&rsquo;, a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers.  I believe that equipping farmers with better financial planning skills is essential and I am encouraging all farmers to engage with this initiative. </p>  <p> Access to finance was also discussed at the meeting of the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee earlier this month which I chaired.  This meeting was a good engagement with representatives of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  Both are now active in the market and my Department, in cooperation with all the other State bodies, will continue to explore additional funding mechanisms for farmers, the agri-food sector and for SMEs generally.</p>  <p>  I also recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility.  The banks assure me that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.  In addition, my Department is about to publish a request for tender to procure an ex-ante assessment to assess any current failures in the access to finance market in Ireland.  This is a first step towards the potential introduction of Financial Instruments under the Rural Development Programme.</p>  <p>  With specific reference to the more flexible State aid support announced by the EU Commission, I am working with all the financial institutions, particularly SBCI, to identify new solutions to working capital finance for farmers experiencing liquidity gaps.  At this week&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting I asked the Commissioner to consider the deployment of a further targeted aid package, similar to that provided last September which gave considerable flexibility to Member States to adopt responses suited to their national circumstances, and I believe such a measure could play a further important role in 2016.  The key word here is flexibility and I have called on the Commission to provide flexibility for MS to deploy the targeted aid in accordance with their needs.   </p></reply>

This scheme aims to support and encourage community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area.  Local Authorities actively participate in this scheme.  To date the scheme has supported the upgrade of more than 12,000 homes and several hundred shared community facilities, including sports clubs, community centres and childcare facilities.</p>  <p>  Under this year's scheme, &euro;20 million in grant support has been awarded to 38 community groups.  This will provide for energy efficiency upgrades to more than 2,600 homes and almost 300 community and commercial facilities.  The total investment in energy efficiency, including funding from local communities themselves, is almost &euro;48 million, which will support an estimated 700 direct and indirect jobs right across the country.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is referring to the application made by Waterford Energy Bureau, on behalf of Waterford City and County Council, for funding under this year's Better Energy Communities scheme, I would like to note that SEAI have informed me that their application was high quality but was unfortunately unsuccessful due to the very high standard of applications.</p>  <p>  All applications to the Better Energy Communities Scheme are assessed in a competitive process operated by SEAI and neither I, nor my Department, have any function in relation to the evaluation or selection of projects.  This competitive process is fully transparent and I would urge any unsuccessful applicants to contact SEAI directly for feedback in relation to their application, which may assist in any future applications for support.</p>  <p>  Any homes that are owned by an approved housing association, such as the Saint Vincent de Paul, are eligible for inclusion in the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, which, based on defined eligibility criteria, provides a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  The homes of the scheme beneficiaries are retrofitted free of charge, thus making those homes more energy efficient.  The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.  Since the scheme commenced in 2000, 123,174 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;161.75m. &euro;16.5m has been allocated to the scheme for 2016. </p></reply>

Bidder(s) will  therefore be invited to put forward minimum speeds for businesses, which can be built into the service standards of the winning bidder(s) contract.  The winning bidder(s) network will be subject to periodic reviews on a 3-5 year basis to ensure that it is keeping pace with demand. </p></reply>

This is scheduled to commence over the coming weeks and will take a number of months; </p><p>- <b>Step 4</b>:  Bidders will be invited to submit detailed solutions for further dialogue (Invitation to submit detailed solutions);</p><p>- <b>Step 4a</b>Bidders will then submit  detailed solutions for evaluation; </p><p>- <b>Step 5:</b>Bidders will be invited to submit final, formal tenders following further dialogue </p><p>- <b>Step 5a:</b>Bidders submit formal tenders; </p><p>- <b>Step 6:</b>Formal tenders submitted by qualified bidders will be evaluated.</p><p>- <b>Step 7:</b>Preferred bidder(s) identified</p><p>- <b>Step 8:</b>25 year contract awarded &ndash; June 2017.</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the dialogue process.  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded in June 2017. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>This ambitious project aims to conclusively address broadband connectivity issues across Ireland and the procurement process aims to secure contractor(s) to build a network that will cover 100,000km of road, and 96% of the land area of Ireland, most of which comprises rural areas.  A project of this magnitude needs to be resourced appropriately and I am confident that my Department has put in place an experienced, and appropriately skilled team to manage the ongoing strategy development and procurement process, both of which are inextricably linked. </p></reply>

Under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, this requirement will come into effect on 30 June 2016 for newly-registering services and on 31 December 2016 for existing services.  </p>  <p>  Under the Child Care Act 1991, childminders who care for more than 3 children of different families in the childminder's own home must be registered with Tusla and will be required to meet the minimum qualification requirement under the Child Care Regulations.  Childminders who care for 3 or fewer children of different families, who care for one or more children of the same family and no other children, or who work in the child's own home, are exempt from the provisions of the Act and from the Regulations.  </p>  <p>  Existing registered childminders may access the Learner Fund, which was introduced to support childcare staff seeking to upskill to meet the new regulations.</p>  <p>  The new qualification requirement is based on international evidence that says that increasing the qualification levels of staff in childcare increases the quality of the service and therefore improves the outcomes for children using the service.  I have no plans, therefore, to review the Regulation governing minimum qualifications.</p>  <p>  The Regulations include provision for an exemption for persons who intend to retire from the sector within the next few years and who do not wish to complete a course of study leading to a major award at Level 5.  Persons who are granted this exemption will not be permitted to work in the pre-school sector after 1st September 2021.  Registered childminders are entitled to apply for this exemption.  Any such applications must be made through the local City/County Childcare Committee before 30th June.</p></reply>

It is a time bound co-funding arrangement with resources of &euro;29.7m from 2013 to 2017.  The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The ABC Programme was preceded by the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) (2007-2013) in which three sites participated: Preparing for Life Programme, Darndale, Youngballymun  and the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght.  Preparing for Life received &euro;6m as a participant in the Prevention and Early Intervention programme.  The total funding for Preparing for Life under the ABC programme is &euro;3.34m bringing the total funding received by Preparing for Life under both programmes to &euro;9.34m.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the excellent research undertaken by Preparing for Life in recent years including in respect of its home visiting programme which is showing promising results.   I should emphasise that each of the ABC sites are engaged in research and evaluation of their programmes, approaches and interventions.  A number of sites who were previously funded under PEIP, National Early Years Access Programme or other philanthropic-funded programmes have produced detailed high quality evaluations with many promising results being identified across the sites and individual programmes.  My Department is working to ensure that we take full account of the learning from all the interventions across the 13 ABC sites including Preparing for Life.  This will offer a clear illustration of the interventions that work best, and will inform our plans to embed prevention and early intervention in services for children.  </p>  <p>  The current contract for Preparing for Life was due to conclude in August 2016.  My Department worked with Preparing for Life in April to agree the extension of this contract together with that of the two other PEIP sites to July 2017.  This will bring them in line with the other 10 ABC sites.   To ensure continued provision, my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies have sanctioned an additional &euro;400k to each of the three original sites.  Preparing for Life welcomed the additional funding and have indicated that it allows them to embed their work in mainstream services and contribute to the learning and evaluation of the ABC Programme.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the continued engagement of the 13 ABC sites with my Department as we work towards the implementation of quality prevention and early intervention initiatives in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout the country. </p></reply>

This commitment was also reflected in the White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, which sets out the policy framework for the Defence Organisation for the next ten years and beyond.</p><p>The scheme and the programme content have been developed through detailed consultation involving the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Social Protection and the Dublin and Dun-Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  A work group which includes representatives from each of the aforementioned organisations has developed the detail of the initiative with key stakeholders.</p><p>The objective of this Scheme is to help develop a path to economic independence for participants, aged between 18 and 24 years, who are at a serious disadvantage owing to their current socio-economic situation.  The Scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection identified suitable participants for participation in the pilot scheme.  The basic selection criteria applied were that the person must:</p><p>-  be aged between 18 and 24,</p><p>-  be unemployed,</p><p>-  want to take part in the programme, and</p><p>-  be healthy and physically able to take part in outdoor activities. </p><p>Potential candidates were then interviewed by a member of the Defence Forces and an official from Department of Social Protection.  Candidates who were successful at interview were then required to pass security vetting and be medically certified as fit to undergo the programme of training by their own civilian GP, prior to the commencement date of the pilot scheme. </p><p>The pilot scheme commenced on Monday 20th June 2016 for 28 participants in Gormanston Camp for 10 weeks.  On successful completion of the programme, participants will receive some certificates which should improve their prospects of securing employment.  These will include:</p><p>-  A joint certificate from the Defence Forces and the Department of Social Protection that the participant has successfully completed the course;</p><p>-  A reference from the Defence Forces Officer leading the course outlining the participant&rsquo;s performance on the course;</p><p>-  A Basic Medical Training certificate;</p><p>-  A Manual Handling Training certificate;</p><p>-  A Certificate on Food Safety Management;</p><p>-  A City and Guilds Credit for Word Processing, Using the Internet and for Using E-mail;</p><p>-  A SOLAS Safe Pass. Safe Pass is a one-day safety awareness programme which is required of all construction site workers.</p></reply>

The WHO reports that in 2015 the number of deaths was 438,000 of which deaths in children under 5 years was 306,000.  However, the key issue remains the fact that malaria is a significant killer on the world stage. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that Lariam can cause, inter alia, neuropsychiatric side effects.  However, it is more difficult to comment on the duration.  Conventional thinking is that side-effects are directly related to blood levels of the product, and as Lariam has a relatively long half-life, the side effects, even by conventional wisdom, could be expected to remain to some degree until the product is &lsquo;washed out&rsquo; of the system, and this could take several weeks. </p>  <p>  With regard to overseas military service, there are numerous confounding factors that may contribute to the patient&rsquo;s symptoms, and it is difficult if not impossible to determine which symptoms are due to any specific entity.  Stress can present in many guises and can result from overseas deployment through absence of usual support mechanisms, operational tempo, fears, worries and concerns related to the family back home, exposure to different climate and culture etc.  Consequently, it is objectively very difficult to attribute symptomatology to any specific cause. </p>  <p>  Lariam can have, inter alia, neuropsychiatric side-effects in certain individuals.  Malarone, as listed on the Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPC) (June 2015 edition), can cause certain patients to suffer from similar neuropsychiatric side-effects such as nightmares, depression, (both listed as &lsquo;common&rsquo;) and anxiety in addition to dizziness and insomnia.  The SPC (June 2015 edition) warnings on Lariam are more emphatic than those contained on the Malarone SPC, although neuropsychiatric side-effects are listed.  Doxycycline is not associated with neuropsychiatric side effects.  It is important, however, to place all warnings in context.  The fact that a medication can exhibit adverse reactions in certain individuals does not, nor should it, prevent its use where the overall benefit to hazard ratio remains positive.  It is vital to follow all the manufacturer&rsquo;s advice and guidance with regard to its use.   </p>  <p>  The Director Medical Branch ( DMB) is fully aware of the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) recommendations with regard to Malarone.  The DMB has commented in various fora, including with the HPRA, on the changes which have occurred in recent times with regard to Malarone&rsquo;s SPC.  On the one hand, the &lsquo;embargo&rsquo; on its prescription for periods in excess of 28 days was removed, but it was replaced with the information that &ldquo; in non-immune subjects, the average duration of exposure in clinical studies was 27 days&rdquo; (SPC June 2015 edition).  This raises questions related to its efficacy, side effect and adverse reaction profile when used for longer periods.   </p>  <p>  The DMB accepts that the three medications mentioned above have malaria chemoprophylactic effects.  The precise efficacy of one over the other depends on many factors, including local sensitivity of the particular species to the individual drug (this can vary over time and over location), proposed exposure of the patient, as well as patient compliance, to name a few relevant factors.  Patient compliance in turn is related to the dosing regimen, the availability of the medication, and the individual&rsquo;s tolerance of any side effects etc.   </p>  <p>  The manufacturers report that absorption of Doxycycline is impaired by calcium, zinc, magnesium or iron salts irrespective of whether the calcium is contained in an antacid or in a dairy product. </p>  <p>  The DMB&rsquo;s current advice, guidance, and policy in relation to malaria chemoprophylaxis is that, in the case of Sub Saharan Africa, Lariam is the agent of first choice.  In special circumstances the other agents may be used.  For example, if for operational reasons it was imperative that an individual deploy immediately without the normal &lsquo;lead-in&rsquo; time which is required for Lariam, then one of the other alternative medications should be used.  Equally, if an individual who had a specific skill set which was fundamental to mission success and either had previously demonstrated sensitivity to Lariam, or had a contraindication to its use in the first place, then that individual would receive derogation from the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; policy and be placed on another medication.  If during the course of deployment, an individual developed sensitivity to Lariam, he/she would desist from Lariam and be placed on an alternative.  In all the examples above, the basic principle remain the same &ndash; it revolves around the balance struck between mission success and patient safety.  In the case of immediate deployment, mission success dictates that an alternative is used.  In the case of the individual who cannot take the first choice medication, mission success dictates that he/she deploys on an alternative.  In the case of the late manifestation of sensitivity, an alternative medication is substituted for Lariam, the individual remains under medical supervision and continues to contribute to mission success.       </p>  <p>  As a result of its extended half-life in the blood, Lariam is taken on a weekly basis rather than on a daily basis.  This has two direct and significant consequences.  Firstly, a weekly medication facilitates compliance.  Secondly, even if a dose is missed by 24 hours, there is still a residual quantity of the active ingredient in the blood which gives a certain degree of protection.  If, however, one of the daily medications is missed by 24 hours, the patient is immediately susceptible to malaria.  Prevention of disease for military personnel serving overseas is of the utmost importance.  In addition, a peace keeping or peace enforcing military force has to prepare for all eventualities.  The military activity of a force is dictated, not so much by a clock or calendar, but by the operational tempo at any given time.  Such a reality creates difficulty in abiding by a daily dosing regimen.  With the best will in the world, unforeseen circumstances can arise.  A daily medication may be overlooked, misplaced, forgotten, left in another location etc., as a result of a change in operational demand and tempo.  This is a fact of life which differentiates the civilian office worker or tourist from the deployed soldier.  Thus the weekly medication provides some mitigation against the unforeseen and unpredictable aspect of overseas service.  This is one of the reasons why Lariam remains the medication of choice in malaria chemoprophylaxis for Defence Forces personnel deployed to Sub Saharan Africa.  While there are other agents available, their use is associated with an increased risk of contracting malaria as indicated above.  Therefore, subject to the special circumstances listed above, an individual who can take Lariam is selected in preference to one who cannot take Lariam because of the lesser risk to the individual and, by extension, to the mission.  There are, however, circumstances when the demands of the mission justify this increased risk.   </p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Irish Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability.  I am advised by the Director Medical Branch that this has been the policy since the Defence Forces first embarked on overseas service.   </p>  <p>  It is not appropriate for the DMB to comment on any individual case raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question both for reasons of medical confidentiality and professional ethics, especially without in-depth knowledge of the particular case and the consent of all concerned.  It should however be noted that it is totally contrary to DMB policy to knowingly prescribe medication to a patient who has a contraindication to that medication.   </p>  <p>  In relation to side effects, the literature varies on the overall percentage of side effects as a result of each of the three malaria chemoprophylactic agents, and each has its own relatively specific spectrum of side effects with Lariam and Malarone sharing certain groups of symptoms and Doxycycline   having largely different (mainly gastro-intestinal related) symptoms.  The numbers of Defence Forces personnel who have actual contraindications to the use of Lariam can be anticipated to be smaller than that in the civilian population because certain cohorts of individuals are precluded from joining the Defence Forces because of a past medical history which would also preclude the use of Lariam.  Of course, there are individuals who, despite having no apparent contraindication contained within their past medical history, can develop sensitivity to Lariam.  There is no way to predict in advance who will develop such sensitivity, once those with an already known contraindication have been excluded.  In the same way it is impossible to predict who will be sensitive to penicillin before administering the drug. </p>  <p>  There are individuals who are unsuited to Lariam either because they have a contraindication to its use, or have developed sensitivity to it.  If the former group are prescribed Lariam, they are at an increased risk of suffering a severe adverse reaction, but the latter group also could, unpredictably, also suffer an adverse reaction.  The spectrum of serious adverse reactions to Lariam includes neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and psychosis. </p>  <p>  In a small study within the Defence Forces, the incidence of death by self-harm was greater during a period where overseas deployment was to non-Lariam type missions than during a period where deployment was on missions where Lariam was prescribed. The study involved an examination of individual files and therefore, it would be inappropriate to disclose the raw data for reasons of medical confidentiality.  The death rate in the Defence Forces from self-inflicted injuries in the period 2000 to 2010, when Lariam was being prescribed, was 0.24%.  The death rate from self-inflicted injuries in the period 1989 to 1999, when Lariam was not being prescribed, was 0.32%. </p>  <p>  As I have indicated to the D&aacute;il, I am currently awaiting the second report of the Malaria Chemoprophylaxis Working Group and until I have had the opportunity to review it, I have no plans to commission any separate studies.  The purpose of the re-convened Malaria Chemoprophylaxis Working Group is to review issues arising in relation to the use of Lariam, particularly in the context of the current and potential litigation.  The Working Group has invited the doctors referred to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, Dr. Nevin and Dr. Croft, to provide information to the group and information from those doctors has been received and is being reviewed by the Group. </p>  <p>  As the original report of the Working Group was produced in the context of current and potential litigation it is, therefore, legally privileged.  Any further report prepared by the re-convened Group will also be produced in the context of current and potential litigation and will, therefore, be legally privileged also. </p>  <p>  The information requested in relation to individual files is contained on confidential medical files and would require review by medical personnel.  There are currently approximately 9,137 personnel serving in the Defence Forces, a significant proportion of whom may have served on a Lariam mission.  In addition, there are probably many hundreds of other personnel who served on Lariam mission but who have now retired, and whose files have been archived.  In that context, it is therefore not considered feasible to carry out such a review of all individual files.</p></reply>

No. 312 of 2014, became applicable with effect from 1 May 2015.  Under LCR, community rating is modified to reflect the age at which a person takes out private health insurance.  Late entry loadings are applied to the premiums of those who join the health insurance market at age 35 or over.  The LCR Regulations stipulate that no loading is applied to an insured person if, on 1st May 2015, the person had a continuous period of cover in an in-patient indemnity health insurance scheme prior to that date.  The primary purpose of introducing LCR is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age.</p>  <p>  The regulation governing the LCR loadings applies equally to all citizens of the State irrespective of the nature of any health care provided by their employer.  Many employers provide a range of health benefits to employees and not necessarily as part of a regulated healthcare insurance product.  It is a matter, therefore, for each citizen to decide whether they wish to take out private health insurance in order to avoid additional loadings for taking out insurance after the age of 34.</p>  <p>  Commissioned Officers are currently provided with private health care by the State, i.e. they can be referred by the Defence Forces for private/semi-private treatment in civilian hospitals or private consultant&rsquo;s rooms, where it is deemed necessary. </p>  <p>  The position of members of the Defence Forces with regard to the LCR Regulations has been raised with the Department of Health, both at official and Ministerial level.  Meetings have been held between officials from the Department of Defence and the Department of Health on 30th April 2015 and 8th January 2016 to discuss the issue.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health stated that the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based on the key principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and minimum benefit.  Community-rated insurance markets depend on a continuing entry of younger people to help keep premium prices down for everybody.  The Department of Health considered that the arrangements in place for Defence Forces personnel do not comply with health insurance legislation or its key principles.  It considered that there has been no impediment to member of the Defence Forces purchasing indemnity health insurance as a means to avoid loadings similar to any other citizen.  It stated that no waiver provision exists in the regulations and that any fair and equitable consideration of a waiver for one group requires consideration of other groups whose employers provide similar health benefits separate to indemnity contract arrangements.  Even if such an arrangement was deemed appropriate, a waiver provision would require to be enacted in primary legislation.  The Department of Health cannot see any basis or mechanism for a waiver to be put in place such that officers could avoid loading when they come to purchase health insurance on retirement from the Defence Forces.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has undertaken to forward to the Health Insurance Authority the concerns of the Defence Forces regarding LCR for consideration as part of a planned independent review of the operation of the LCR Regulations scheduled for 2017.</p></reply>
