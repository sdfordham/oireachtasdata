The European Council will discuss three clusters of issues.  These are (a) increasing the effectiveness, visibility and impact of CSDP; (b) enhancing the development of defence capabilities; and, (c) strengthening Europe&rsquo;s defence industry.  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council, I hosted a seminar in Dublin Castle on 17th   May, 2013, to discuss these issues.  The seminar formed an integral part of the preparatory process of developing the agenda for the European Council discussion, with presentations from the European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, the European Commission, Member States, academia and industry.  In my own address, I underlined the importance of this Council meeting and the need for clarity and consensus at EU level to ensure that the EU can effectively respond to emerging international crises.  I pointed out that achieving the EU&rsquo;s ambition in Common Security and Defence Policy requires a greater willingness amongst Member States to coordinate their efforts, rather than continuing to act individually.  There is also a need to ensure that the Union has the requisite resources and military capabilities, able and willing to effectively respond to emerging international crises that could ultimately have an adverse effect on the EU and on the security of our States and our citizens.  Having capabilities is one thing, but as I said at the seminar, the political will to deploy them is a key and missing component, which Heads of State and Government will need to address in December.  I also pointed to the important role which the Defence Industry plays in support of jobs, growth, leading edge technology and innovation and, with a particular focus on our own national capacity, the contribution which SMEs can make in this regard.  Contributors and participants had the opportunity to consider this and to debate the issues across the three clusters mentioned above.</p></reply>

The medical classification of all personnel is kept under review and where a person is confirmed as being unfit for service with the Defence Forces, action is initiated towards retirement, relinquishment of commission or discharge, as the case may be. The circumstances in which an injury occurs, be it while taking part in leisure activities or otherwise, are not relevant to and play no part in the medical classification assigned.  In the context of the roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces, military medical services and facilities exist to maintain the health of Defence Forces members, and to support them in their operational and overseas activities. In this regard the focus of the military medical services is on primary care, occupational medicine, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training.</p></reply>

Should such a request be received I would, of course, give it due consideration.   The major re-organisation of the RDF currently underway is being overseen by a High Level Implementation Group comprising senior civil and Military Management of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  The Group, which meets on a weekly basis, has been planning and implementing the recommended changes and a new &ldquo;Single Force&rdquo; structure is now in place which has dovetailed with the re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).</p><p>  RDFRA has had a significant input into the change process for the Reserve.  A series of bi-lateral meetings of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces commenced, and are continuing, on a regular basis with RDFRA.  These meetings, which are chaired by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support), are also attended by Military personnel and Departmental staff. The meetings afford RDFRA an opportunity to raise issues they may have in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve.  Similar meetings were held with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) at which they were afforded the opportunity to raise issues they had in connection with the PDF Cadre support staff in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve.</p><p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) also attended the RDF Special Delegate Conference, in March 2013, at which he addressed a wide variety of issues raised by their members in relation to the re-organisation of the RDF.  A Seminar is to be held on 29 June next in the Defence Forces Training Centre, Curragh Camp.  This is being held for RDF Unit Commanders in order to afford them the opportunity to discuss any concerns they may have in relation to the re-organisation.</p><p>  In addition, there have been on-going briefings to the Reserve Defence Force by relevant Military Personnel in relation to the re-organisation of the Reserve.</p><p>  I am satisfied that there are sufficient and robust systems in place within the Defence Organisation to ensure that issues of concern to members of the Reserve Defence Force are brought to my attention, as appropriate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-18a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061800058#WRA01500"><p>The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service, as provided in the White Paper on Defence (2000), is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with national legislation and the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union.  In its fishery protection role, the Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time. Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, the Naval Service is empowered to board and inspect vessels and their cargos, and when necessary to formally detain vessels and direct them to port for arrest by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  In 2012, the Naval Service carried out a total of 1,258 patrol days and undertook 1,329 boardings of vessels, issued 41 warnings and detained 20 vessels.  In addition, the Air Corps&rsquo; CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft conducted 241 missions throughout the year.  The Air Corps operates closely with Naval Service vessels at sea to promote compliance with national and EU fisheries legislation.</p><p>  In order to achieve compliance with quota and other conservation legislation under the Common Fisheries Policy, Naval Service fisheries protection operations and priorities are agreed each year between the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. For 2013, the Naval Service is committed to 1,267 patrol days whilst the Air Corps will carry out 300 maritime air patrols. The role of the Naval Service and the Air Corps in this regard is coordinated by the Fisheries Monitoring Centre (FMC) which is based in the Naval Headquarters at Haulbowline. </p><p>  My Department is currently in the process of entering into a renewed Service Level Agreement with the SFPA which will help to further improve co-ordination and collaboration in relation to this important role for the Naval Service.</p><p>  The Naval Service is currently equipped with a total of eight patrol vessels.  In the near future, two of the oldest vessels will be replaced with two new patrol vessels which will be delivered in early 2014 and 2015 respectively.  Together with the refurbishment of other vessels in the fleet, this will help to ensure that the Naval Service can maintain its current outputs and meet all agreed targets.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-18a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061800058#WRA01700"><p>Pursuant to the Red Cross Act of 1938, the Irish Red Cross Society was established by Government Order in 1939 as an independent charitable body corporate with full power to manage and administer its own affairs. Since 1939, the relevant Establishment Order had undergone piecemeal changes only but, in April of last year, I received Government approval to make substantial changes to the 1939 Order.  These represented the most wide ranging and fundamental set of changes to have occurred since the establishment of the Society.  One of the key changes made was a substantial reduction in the number of Government nominees to the Society&rsquo;s General Assembly; from not less than one-third of its composition to not more than 10%.  Furthermore, the legislation was also amended to provide that the Chairperson of the Society is now elected by the Society itself, in accordance with its own Rules and Constitution, rather than by the President. In tandem with the Government&rsquo;s initiative in amending the legislation, the Society itself made a number of very progressive changes to its Constitution and Rules.  I believe that the Society now has in place a 21st   century corporate governance framework that meets the rigorous standards set for good governance internationally by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p><p>  There is clearly a strong impetus for change within the Society itself and whilst a lot of important initiatives have been taken place over the past two years, these have tended, necessarily, to be focused on Governance reform, the overhaul of the Society&rsquo;s financial management systems and reporting processes, and a revision of its Operating Policies and Procedures.  I am pleased to note that this work is substantially complete and the attention of the Society has now turned to addressing other strategic challenges such as the development of a resilient and reliable funding base, more dynamic  management of resources and the development of organisational structures that will enable the Society to deliver its services more effectively to its beneficiaries, at home and abroad.  I am satisfied that this phase of the Society&rsquo;s reform is now gathering momentum and I understand that the Board of Directors has recently set progress milestones for itself to ensure that it remains on course for completion by the middle of next year. </p><p>  Finally, it is important that I also mention the commitment made in the Programme for Government for the initiation of a detailed legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Red Cross in Ireland to improve its functioning in the light of changing circumstances.  I can confirm that my Department has commenced work on the review and I anticipate that this will result in a Red Cross Act (Amendment) Bill during the lifetime of this Government.</p></reply>

The service was established by agreement between my Department and the Department of Health to assess the level and type, if any, of dedicated emergency aeromedical support needed to assist the National Ambulance Service, primarily in the west of Ireland, for certain types of patient, particularly in light of the requirements of the HSE Clinical Care Programmes such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke. </p><p>  A review of the pilot service is currently being finalised by an Audit and Evaluation Group established under the agreement. A Report, with recommendations, will be submitted for consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Health, shortly. Following a recent request from the Minister for Health, I have agreed to extend the Air Corps' participation in the pilot for a period of up to three months in order to allow him an opportunity to give consideration to the Report. </p><p>  The Air Corps will continue to operate the EAS service during the period of the extension pending consideration by the Minister for Health of the recommendations contained in the Report.</p></reply>

The Deputy can be assured that I am minded to ensure that modern and effective clothing and equipment is available for our troops in overseas peace support operations. In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.   The military authorities have advised me that clothing and kit issued to Defence Forces personnel serving in Lebanon is of the highest quality and fit for purpose. I have also been advised that the Defence Forces issue a comprehensive set of clothing to each member of the Defence Forces which is designed to cope with a wide range of weather conditions both at home and overseas.  Additional supplementary clothing and footwear may be issued where extreme conditions are to be encountered. I am advised that the Defence Forces are satisfied that the current clothing arrangements are sufficient for the requirements of the Defence Forces.  </p><p>  The Defence Forces authorities have also assured me that appropriate force protection assets and capabilities have been deployed to operate in the current and future environment in Lebanon.</p><p>  In addition, in recent years, significant work has been carried out on the acquisition of an Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System for individual soldiers. This equipment is top of the range. The system includes Body Armour, Helmets, Back Packs (Rucksacks) and Battle Vests. The Battle Vests are used for the carriage of essential items such as ammunition, personal radio and water.</p></reply>

The 108th Infantry Battalion, comprising some 337 personnel, was deployed to UNIFIL in May 2013 when it replaced personnel of the 107th Infantry Battalion.  The Irish Battalion has been working alongside a contingent of 170 personnel of the Finnish Armed Forces as part of a joint Irish/Finnish Battalion. A further 16 Irish personnel are deployed to the Force Headquarters in Naquora and 8 personnel at the UNIFIL Sector West headquarters in Shama. The Irish/Finnish Battalion conducts operational tasks on a daily basis, which include the provision of security, vehicle and foot patrols, checkpoints, establishing and occupying temporary observation posts and liaison/engagement with local leaders. Joint operations are conducted with units of the Lebanese Armed Forces deployed in the UNIFIL area of operations. Irish and Finnish troops also occupy two forward static UN posts on the Blue Line separating Lebanon and Israel. </p><p>  The security situation in the area in which the Irish/Finnish Battalion operates remains calm but increasingly unstable due to domestic and international factors largely stemming from the spillover effects of the Syrian crisis.  The Battalion implements Force Protection measures appropriate to the prevailing operational and security developments in the region. </p><p>  Ireland currently holds command of the joint Irish/Finnish Battalion. Finland, in accordance with agreements entered into on the deployment of the joint battalion, will assume command of the joint battalion in November 2013. At that stage, the Irish contribution to the Finnish/Irish Battalion will reduce from 337 to approximately 171 Defence Forces personnel.</p></reply>

It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area.  The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces &ndash; including the use of Lariam &ndash; has worked.  In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel getting malaria.</p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the statutory body that regulates medicines available in Ireland.  I am advised that the three anti-malarial medications licensed by the IMB &ndash; Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline &ndash; can all have significant side effects.  To assert that any one is automatically a more effective or safer alternative to the others is a grossly misleading oversimplification.  Each of the three drugs has been used by the Defence Forces, depending on individual circumstances including the type of malaria in the destination, the duration of travel, etc.  </p><p>  I am further advised that the Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications. Protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.  </p><p>  Lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>  Up to September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use and was not an option as the usual duration of deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months.  The 28-day limit was removed in September 2012.  However, there is limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone usage for longer periods.  The position is currently being reviewed by the Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps.</p><p>  I have had the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and have obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces.</p><p>  Lariam must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

Fermanagh are primarily the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.</p><p>  Arising from liaison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces have a number of requested assets available on stand-by to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if required.These include Explosive Ordnance Disposal Teams and Engineer Specialised Search Teams along with Air Corps and Naval Service support.</p><p>  Until the security operation has been fully wound down, the final costs of the specific contribution by the Defence Forces cannot be confirmed.Such costs are likely to include travel and subsistence and the payment of allowances for those personnel directly involved in the security operation.</p><p>  No plans have been made to cancel Defence Forces leave during the period of the G8 Summit, however the individual General Officers Commanding have the right to cancel or restrict leave in exceptional operational circumstances.</p></reply>

Intelligence led liaison is conducted between Intelligence Branch and national authorities in other countries to counter any threat to the security of the State.  The Intelligence Branch also maintains a very close and effective working relationship with their counterparts in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   <font color="#FFFFFF"> </font></p><p>  The Defence Forces adheres to the provisions of all legislation regulating the conduct of intelligence gathering.  The Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993 does provide the Defence Forces with the authority to conduct intelligence led operations involving surveillance, electronic communications and stored electronic information in order to safeguard and maintain the security of the State.  The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 also provides for surveillance to be conducted by the Defence Forces in order to safeguard the security of the State.  </p><p>These Acts also provide a system of judicial supervision with reports to be submitted to An Taoiseach by designated judges who are appointed by the President of the High Court to review the conduct of certain sections of the Acts. The relevant legislation further provides that a copy of such reports is laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  In all cases, the capabilities provided to the Defence Forces are the subject of both Ministerial and Judicial oversight and to the restrictions and safeguards as outlined in the legislation.</p></reply>

Representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces also ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency.</p><p>  A Service Level Agreement between my Department and the Department of Health is in place which formalises the arrangements for the support provided by the Air Corps for emergency inter-hospital transfers, in the following cases:</p><p>- spinal and serious injuries and illnesses, </p><p>- air transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention within Ireland, </p><p>- air transport of patients requiring organ transplants in the UK, </p><p>- air transport of Organ Retrieval Teams within Ireland, and </p><p>- air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals where the Irish Coast Guard service is not available. </p><p>  In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding has been agreed between my Department and the Department of Health which underpins the Air Corps' support to the National Ambulance Service for a pilot Emergency Aeromedical Support service, operating primarily in the west of Ireland and from Custume Barracks Athlone. This pilot service was for a twelve month period from 4 June 2012.

The budgetary situation continues to dictate the level of funding available for recruitment, new equipment and upgrading facilities.   In relation to the current strength of the Defence Forces I am advised by the military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 30 April 2013, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,163. This is against the agreed stabilised strength for the Permanent Defence Force of 9,500.  In this context it is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.Targeted recruitment will ensure that into the future the Permanent Defence Force can continue to deliver all operational outputs required by Government in the domestic environment as well as for overseas peace support operations. The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, is also available for deployments in response to emergencies and crises.</p><p>  The Defence property portfolio is kept under review to ensure the most effective use of military resources having regard to the roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces. The Department has been engaged on an ongoing programme of barrack consolidation since 1998.

Some of these have already been disposed of whilst others are in the process of being prepared for disposal. These mainly consist of married quarters and Reserve Defence Force premises. </p><p>  The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years. As the Deputy is aware I have indicated to the House previously there are no plans for further barrack closures. There is also a programme in place for the maintenance and development of necessary facilities to enable the Defence Forces to continue to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

However, it is imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, similar to all other Government Departments, must take into account the current difficult economic environment we are now operating in. The budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. A particular focus is maintained in ensuring that modern and effective equipment is available for overseas peace support operations. In this regard, the personal equipment, which the individual soldier has at his/her disposal in Lebanon and on other overseas missions is second to none and compares very favourably with the equipment in use by other countries.  <i></i></p><p>  Investment in new equipment and upgrading of existing equipment for the Defence Forces is provided for under various subheads of the Defence Vote relating to Defensive Equipment, Transport, Aircraft, Naval Service Ships and Stores and Communications and Information Technology Equipment. </p><p>I am advised that the provision allocated in 2013 specifically for the purchase of defensive equipment and ammunition is &euro;26.5m. This allows for the acquisition of a range of priority defensive equipment and munitions such as Force Protection Equipment, a new Ground Surveillance Radar system, a replacement programme for the 12.7mm Heavy Machine Gun and the continued implementation of a Rifle Enhancement Programme for the Steyr Rifle which has been in service for nearly 25 years.  <font color="#FF0000"> </font></p><p>  The Rifle upgrade programme is a multi annual programme which represents one of the most significant investments the Government is making in terms of the impact it will have on Defence Forces personnel at the coal face. The project is currently the subject of a number of tender competitions, the results of which will dictate the value of the programme going forward. The provision for 2013 also provides for the upgrade and refurbishment programme of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal HOBO robots. This is one of the most important current programmes for the Defence organisation given the increased levels of call outs witnessed in recent years by the Defence Forces. </p><p>  With regard to the Naval Service, my Department, in conjunction with the Naval Service, is overseeing the acquisition of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels. The construction of the first ship is well advanced and is scheduled for delivery in early 2014. The second ship will follow one year later.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the level of resources and equipment available to the Defence Forces enables the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas in an efficient and effective manner.</p></reply>

On 9 October 2012, the UN Security Council extended ISAF&rsquo;s mandate for a further year until October 2013. Ireland has participated in the NATO&ndash;led UN mandated mission in Afghanistan since 5 July 2002. The continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF is reviewed annually by the Government.I will shortly bring proposals to Government to continue to provide seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with ISAF for a further period from July 2013, subject to ongoing review. ISAF has a current strength of approximately 99,590 personnel drawn from 48 Countries. In March 2011, the transition process whereby the Afghan security forces would gradually take on more security responsibility from ISAF was launched. </p><p>As of 31 December 2012, twenty-three (23) of the thirty-four (34) Afghan provinces are fully in transition.

Copies of these reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are also publicly available on the Ombudsman&rsquo;s website www.odf.ie.  The latest annual report published by the ODF is in respect of 2011.  The 2012 report is awaiting publication.   I am advised by the office of the ODF that from 1 December 2005, the date when the operational functions of the ODF commenced, to 31 December 2011, some 752 directly referred complaints and notifications on complaints made under section 114 of the Defence Act 1954, as amended, have been processed by the office of the ODF.  Of this number some 241 complaints proceeded to a full formal investigation.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the system is working well.  Since the establishment of the office of the ODF a number of administrative and systemic issues have been identified and addressed which has contributed to improvements in procedures and policies within the Defence Forces and this work is ongoing.  I welcome the fact that more redress cases are now being resolved at an early stage by the military authorities without the need for referral to the ODF.  This has resulted in a reduction in the number of cases being referred to the ODF in recent years which is a positive development.</p></reply>

I may also appoint up to six public servants of whom at least one shall represent the Taoiseach and one shall represent the Minister for Finance.  These appointments represent relevant Departments to ensure the NESC's work is integrated with Government policy-making.  I also appointed eight independent members to the NESC in 2011, in most cases from the academic sector.  These appointments were made following careful consideration of the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise relevant to the functions of the Council as required by the legislation.  The Government has put in place new arrangements for making of appointments to State Boards.  The option of utilising the new process, for inviting expressions of public interest, will be considered when the next round of appointments of independent members to the NESC arises.  No vacancies currently exist on the Council.  There has been one appointment to the National Statistics Board (NSB) since March 2011.  An Assistant Secretary at my Department was appointed to the NSB in line with the provisions of Section 18 (1)(<i>b</i>) of the Statistics Act 1993, and as such this vacancy was not advertised.

The Convention, as amended by Protocol 14, stipulates that the term of office of a judge of the Court is nine years and may not be renewed.  The current judge elected in respect of Ireland is Ann Power-Forde, who was elected to the position by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in January 2008 and consequently her term will expire in 2017.  The process to begin the selection of three candidates to go forward for election will not commence until a request from the Council of Europe is received.  Previous judges of the European Court of Human Rights elected with respect to Ireland are as follows: John Hedigan (1998-2007), Brian Walsh (1980-1998), Philip O&rsquo;Donoghue (1971-1980), Conor Alexander Maguire (1965-1971), and Richard McGonigal (1959-1964).  Article 21 of the Convention requires that judges sit on the Court in their individual capacity and not as national representatives.  It is a full-time position and judges' salaries are paid by the Council of Europe not the High Contracting Party in respect of which they are elected.  The current annual salary for the position is &euro;235,788.  The budget of the European Court of Human Rights comes from the overall Council of Europe budget financed by contributions from the 47 member states of the Council of Europe. The 2013 contribution of Ireland to the Council of Europe was &euro;2,441,187.  The overall Council of Europe budget for 2013 is &euro;244 million, of which &euro;67 million is for the European Court of Human Rights.</p></reply>

Their use in armed conflict is subject to international humanitarian law.  This sets specific requirements in relation to the use of force in armed conflict, including the principles of necessity, proportionality and distinction.  I am deeply concerned about any indiscriminate use of UAVs, which would clearly be contrary to international law, and by instances where innocent civilians have been killed by attacks using UAVs.  However, I see no prospect of an agreement to ban the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, either in their totality or for specifically military purposes.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s merchandise exports to Canada increased by 11% in 2012 to over &euro;780 million.  Exports by indigenous Irish Enterprise Ireland client companies increased by 26% in 2012 to over &euro;214 million.  A more detailed breakdown of our trade with Canada in 2011 and 2012 follows this reply.  The recent Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Canada, which took place from 11 to 14 June, was led by the Minister of State for Trade and Development at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello.  It was organised in close co-operation with my Department and the Embassy of Ireland to Canada.  The Minister of State was accompanied on the trade mission by officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Embassy of Ireland in Canada and Enterprise Ireland.  A key objective of the mission was to create and develop opportunities for Irish companies in the oil and gas industries in the province of Alberta.  Fifteen Irish companies in the engineering, construction, technology and recruitment sectors participated in the mission.  During the trade mission, the Minister of State met with Deputy Premier and Ministers of the Government of Alberta, as well as a range of Irish companies and their Canadian partners and customers.  He delivered keynote addresses at networking events organised in conjunction with the Ireland-Canada Centre of Commerce in Calgary and the Ireland-Canada Chamber of Commerce in Edmonton.  He delivered a speech at a Seminar on European Innovation in the Canadian Heavy Oil Industry.  In addition, he used the opportunities presented by engagement with the Irish-Canadian community to promote The Gathering.</p><p>Among the highlights of the trade mission were the conclusion of an agreement between PM Group and its Canadian Partner, Gas Liquids Engineering, which will see both organisations working together in the gas processing industry in Europe and across the world; a long-term contract secured by Decisions [D4H] with the Government of Alberta for the provision of their innovative software; and an event with Canadian business contacts to mark the recent opening by Tech Skills of its first office in Canada.  I am confident that the contacts made and developed during this trade mission will lead to ongoing opportunities for Irish companies to increase their exports to the Canadian market and expand their engagement with new and existing Canadian partners.  Trade missions are one of the ways in which we aim to support the Irish enterprise sector to develop trade, tourism and investment opportunities across the globe.  Our Embassy network and state agencies overseas work hard to identify specific export and investment opportunities, build extensive business and political contact networks, lobby on market access issues and promote Ireland as a destination for tourism and for study.  The Taoiseach and I look forwarded to discussing Ireland-Canada and EU-Canada relations with the Canadian PM, Stephen Harper, including our trading and economic relationship, when he visited Dublin from 15 to 17 June.</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Merchandise 2011</th><th>Services 2011 </th><th>Merchandise 2012</th><th>Services 2012</th></tr><tr><td>Exports to Canada </td><td>&euro;627 Million</td><td>&euro;1,115 Million</td><td>&euro;781 Million</td><td>n/a*</td></tr><tr><td>Imports from Canada </td><td>&euro;257 Million</td><td>&euro;444 Million</td><td>&euro;246 Million </td><td>n/a*</td></tr><tr><td>Trade Surplus</td><td>&euro;370 Million</td><td>&euro;671 Million </td><td>&euro;535 Million </td><td>n/a* </td></tr></table></p><p>*Figures for 2012 services exports broken down by country will be available from the CSO in autumn 2013</p></reply>

It reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to international development and its centrality to our foreign policy.  The new policy restates the commitment in the Programme for Government to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product for Official Development Assistance (ODA).  Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance.  This is a significant achievement in the context of the very difficult economic conditions facing the country.  We have allocated a total of &euro;622 million for ODA for 2013.  We will continue to work to maintain aid expenditure broadly at current levels until economic circumstances permit us to make further progress towards achieving the 0.7% target.</p></reply>

Applications were appraised against the four published criteria: language skills (in particular a good working knowledge of French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic or Portuguese); experience of elections and/or as an election observer; knowledge of human rights and democratisation issues; and experience of living and working in challenging conditions.  Equal weighting was attached to each of the criteria.  </p><p>  The applications were independently scored by two individuals, external to the Department, and ranked according to the average of the two scores awarded to their application.

The final review will be completed within ten working days of receipt of the appeal.  To date, one such review has been completed at the request of an applicant. One further applicant is in correspondence with the Department regarding the selection process and has indicated he may request an appeal.</p></reply>

Occasionally, consultants or companies with some communications experience are commissioned to provide services such as project management, logistics and event management.  I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on all consultant expenditure and commissioning of such work is in full compliance with national and EU procurement regulations concerning tendering requirements.  DHR Communications has been contracted since 2010 to manage and administer the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) grants scheme. This involves managing two funding rounds each year, including through national and regional information workshops; managing and administering the application process; organising the judging process and providing detailed feedback to all applicants; processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records; maintaining and updating the SCMF website and managing the SCMF student competition.  DHR was awarded a two-year contract to 2012 and was re-engaged in February 2012 for a further two years following a competitive tendering process.      Following a competitive tendering process, DHR has been engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin. This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of my Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This work represented a very minor element of the project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.</p><p>Africa Day Family Days, incorporating musical entertainment, cultural activities and an African Bazaar, were hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010;  in CHQ in Georges Dock in 2012 and Farmleigh Estate in 2013. In 2011, the Department supported a smaller-scale series of performances, family events, art exhibitions, debates and educational activities instead of hosting a flagship event. The fees and expenses set out below reflect the greater expense and management cost involved in hosting a flagship event for Africa Day.</p><p>DHR also provided short-term management support services for the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, including the logistical management of the nationwide public consultation activities.  The table below sets out fees and third party expenses paid to DHR Communications since 9 March 2011.  It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.

On this occasion, I expect that Ministers from North and South will together take the opportunity to review our EU residency including the involvement of Northern Ministers in Presidency-related events and the progress made on key issues of mutual interest during the Presidency.  I would also expect matters of topical concern such as youth employment to be discussed.It is customary for Ministers to review work undertaken in the areas of North South cooperation, including by the North-South bodies since the preceding plenary meeting.  I hope that we will also discuss progress made on the St Andrews Agreement Review on expanding the areas of North South cooperation, and I hope to discuss the North West Gateway Initiative.  Meetings of the North South Ministerial Council in Plenary format have become an excellent forum for substantive exchanges on topics of mutual interest.  I am therefore looking forward to the Plenary in July and to continuing to work with our Northern colleagues in further developing North South cooperation.</p></reply>

An important element of the programme is support for public information and engagement, including development education in Ireland.  Ireland&rsquo;s new Policy for International Development, One World, One Future, reflects our continued commitment to supporting public engagement and development education.  Development education is integral to our efforts to develop understanding of, and debate on, global development issues. Ireland&rsquo;s development education funding supports activities which build a stronger understanding of global development issues, strengthen public awareness of the reality of the issues involved in our commitment to development cooperation, and promote a stronger sense of global solidarity.</p><p>  The D&oacute;chas research referred to examined a number of areas of expenditure on public engagement, including development education, between 1995 and 2009.  I am pleased to confirm that over the last five years, despite the very difficult economic situation, Irish Aid has maintained expenditure on development education at around 1% of ODA.  This represents a very significant investment and supports a wide range of organisations and activities. We have managed to maintain this level of funding by focussing on core priorities for development education and on strengthening the focus on results from our investment in development education. Core priorities include initial teacher education; post-primary schools-based work; online access to development education resources; capacity building for the development education sector; and a programme with third level students in Irish universities. </p><p>  Expenditure under the Development Education budget amounted to &euro;3.2m in both 2011 and 2012.  The approved budget for 2013 is &euro;3.5m. In addition, Irish Aid has asked NGOs which are provided with long term development programme grants to incorporate development education and public engagement initiatives in their work programmes.  Last year, &euro;1.5 million was expended on such initiatives.  </p><p>  I am proud of Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation for the delivery of high quality development education,  through which we aim to deepen our citizens&rsquo; understanding, and encourage people to take action for a more just and equal world.  In order to further strengthen the quality of development education in Ireland, and in line with the commitment in our new International Development Policy, I have appointed a new member of the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group with significant development education expertise to advise on development education.</p></reply>

Ireland has made a significant contribution to development and the fight against poverty and hunger in Ethiopia. In the past decade Ethiopia has recorded remarkable improvements in human development, as measured by the UN Human Development Index. This progress is a strong example of the success of international development assistance when delivered in partnership with a developing country Government.    However, we strongly believe that positive development results and respect for human rights must go hand in hand. Improvement in human rights and the rule of law are central to our relationship with Ethiopia and we remain strongly committed to helping build good governance and the rights of the most vulnerable in Ethiopia. </p><p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa works on an ongoing basis, directly and in cooperation with other EU partners, to engage with the Ethiopian Government at all levels on a range of governance and human rights issues. We continue to monitor the human rights situation in Ethiopia and to take account of various views in order to form a balanced assessment across the full range of human rights issues. </p><p>  I have seen a report from the Oromo Relief Association in the UK which provides information on 58 Oromo and two Ogadeni refugees from Ethiopia who were interviewed in South Africa. The report details alleged abuses they suffered while in detention in Ethiopia.    Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have on previous occasions met with representatives of the Oromo Liberation Front and the Ogaden National Liberation Front in Ireland to discuss their concerns and issues raised by the Oromo and Ogadeni communities.  I have asked our Embassy in Addis Ababa to follow up on this recent report from the Oromo Relief Association.  We will continue to work in cooperation with our EU partners to raise human rights issues with the Ethiopian government and to improve the situation through our engagement and through our development assistance programme.</p></reply>

Ireland has developed an important partnership with the United States on the <i>1,000 Days </i>initiative to address the continuing crisis of maternal and child under-nutrition in some of the poorest countries and communities. The first thousand days, from pregnancy to a child's second birthday, is the most critical period for a child's physical and cognitive development. Lack of critical vitamins and micro-nutrients during this period reduces a child's chances of survival. It can also result in children being stunted and underweight, with devastating consequences for their development.  On 10 June, I attended a civil society event in Washington on 'Sustaining Political Commitment to Scaling Up Nutrition', which was co-hosted by an American Non-Governmental Organisation, Bread for the World, and Concern Worldwide.   I delivered a keynote address at the event along with Dr. Rajiv Shah, the Administrator of USAID.  The event highlighted progress on maternal and child under-nutrition in the 1000 days since the launch of the 1,000 Days initiative in September 2010. </p><p>  To mark the US-Irish partnership on maternal and child malnutrition, and to build further commitment, Ireland's Ambassador to the United States co-hosted an event on 11 June, at the Embassy, with Mr. Jonathan Shrier, Acting Special Representative on Food Security at the US Department of State. The event was attended by Dr. Rajiv Shah along with members of US Government agencies, civil society, business, international agencies and diplomatic missions.   </p><p>  While significant progress has been achieved on improving maternal and child malnutrition in the last thousand days, a report published in the Lancet Medical Journal on 6 June demonstrated that under- nutrition is the underlying cause of nearly half of the deaths of children under five. The report also highlighted the devastating economic consequences of poor nutrition, which is estimated to reduce GDP in Africa and Asia by as much as 11%. The Lancet report has further strengthened the case for ensuring that mothers and babies have good nutrition during the 1000 days window of opportunity.</p><p>  Ireland's new Policy on Global Development, &#8220;One World, One Future&#8221;, which was launched last month, commits us to continuing our efforts to address this scourge. In Washington, I reiterated Ireland's commitment to redouble our engagement on malnutrition in Irish Aid's key partner countries, as pledged by the Taoiseach at the 'Nutrition for Growth' meeting in London on 8 June. </p></reply>

For 2013, the liability date is 1 May 2013 while the payment due date is 1 July 2013, and for 2014, the liability date is 1 November 2013 and the payment due date is 1 January 2014.   For individuals who own residential properties, the 2014 LPT charge is payable on 1 January 2014.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a payable date of 1 January is necessary to enable phased payments by way of deduction at source from employment or occupational pension income or from certain payments from the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to be spread evenly over the course of 2014.  Payments made through approved payment service providers by way of cash, debit card or credit card can be paid in full or can run from 1 January 2014 to the end of 2014 on a weekly or monthly basis as it suits the property owner.  Payments made by direct debit will commence on 15 January 2014 and will be deducted on the 15th day of each month thereafter.  Payment of the full amount by way of Single Debit Authority will be deducted from the nominated bank account on 21 March 2014.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that local authorities are liable to pay LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties are used to accommodate people with special housing needs as the legislation provides for a specific exemption in these cases.  </p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 states that for properties that are liable to LPT, local authorities and other social housing providers will have until 1 January 2014 to pay their 2013 charge.  The LPT liability for 2014 for local authorities and other social housing providers is also payable on 1 January 2014.</p><p>  I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners are currently in dialogue with representatives of the City and County Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA) to discuss administrative issues associated with the payment of LPT by local authorities.</p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  The USC is an annual tax payable on an individual's total income in a year, subject to a number of exemptions and reliefs.  In particular, an individual is not liable to pay USC where his or her total income in the tax year does not exceed &euro;10,036.  In addition, payments from the Department of Social Protection such as the State Pension are exempt from the USC and such payments will not be taken in to account in determining if an individual has exceeded the &euro;10,036 threshold. </p><p>  In addition, individuals in receipt of a full medical card or aged 70 and over, provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000, are not liable to the top rate of charge.  </p><p>  In computing the USC payable in a year, contributions to a pension fund are not taken into account to reduce the amount of USC payable as would be the case with income tax.  As such, the USC payable by an employee is charged on the person's gross income. </p><p>  Pensions other than state pensions, made by any state or territory, form part of an individual's income for USC purposes. </p></reply>

A key element will be a comprehensive Balance Sheet Assessment to be finalised by end-November 2013. </p><p>  The various preparatory supervisory steps that the authorities are undertaking will ensure that a stress test of the Irish banking sector will be conducted ahead of, but in close proximity to, the EU-wide exercise in 2014  . </p><p>Speculating on the results of these tests is not very useful as the outcome of the tests will depend on the results of a comprehensive exercise, the parameters of which have yet to be agreed.

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:</p><p>1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.</p><p>2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.</p><p>3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment. </p><p>4. An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.</p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case, depends on the total level of income that the individual or couple concerned has in the relevant tax year or years.  </p><p>  I would point out that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.</p></reply>

They are perpetual instruments and as such are not a loan in the sense of having a fixed maturity date.  The decision to inject capital in the form of preference shares dates back to early 2009 and reflected economic and financial conditions as they were then.  As the State now also owns 99.8% of the equity in the bank and a &euro;1.6bn holding of contingent capital, these investments are best viewed and analysed on a holistic basis.  To date no decision has been made to convert any of AIB's preference shares or indeed make any other changes to the bank&rsquo;s capital structure.  I remain very supportive of the bank&rsquo;s efforts to return itself to profitability and ultimately generate an exit for the taxpayer from these investments in the years ahead.  As such I will consider any sensible recommendations that are made to me in relation to the bank's capital structure that will help deliver these aims.</p></reply>

In this context specific tax reliefs are provided where farms are passed on from one generation to the next.  These reliefs include Capital Acquisitions Tax (&quot;CAT&quot;) agricultural relief, Capital Gains Tax (&quot;CGT&quot;) relief on transfer of farms to children and Stamp Duty Relief on family transfers and transfers to young trained farmers.  These reliefs are summarised below.</p><p><b><i>Capital Acquisitions Tax </i></b></p><p>  Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) is the overall title for both Gift and Inheritance Tax.</p><p>  While the passing on of family farms from one generation to the next by way of gift or inheritance can give rise to a charge to CAT, the following relief applies. </p><p><b>CAT Relief on Transfer of Agricultural Property</b></p><p>  In order to qualify for this agricultural relief an individual receiving a gift or inheritance of agricultural property must qualify as a farmer.  For the purpose of the relief a farmer is an individual at least 80% of whose assets constitute agricultural property. </p><p>  CAT agricultural relief takes the form of a reduction in the market value of the agricultural property - currently by 90% - for the purposes of establishing the Group thresholds and determining whether or not a CAT liability arises on a transfer.  This relief has increased over the years from an original reduction of 50% when CAT was introduced in 1975.  The relief will be withdrawn if the agricultural property is sold or compulsorily acquired within six years of or, in certain circumstances, ten years of the gift or inheritance unless the proceeds are reinvested in other agricultural property.</p><p>  The overall position as regards CAT is therefore, that parents can transfer a family farm with a market value of up to &euro;2,250,000 to a child without any charge to CAT arising on the transfer, (assuming the child qualifies as a &quot;farmer&quot; under the 80% assets test) as the market value of the agricultural lands transferred would be reduced by 90% to &euro;225,000 - this is the Group A threshold for transfers from parent to child for CAT purposes -  to leave no CAT payable.</p><p>  (This assumes that the child has received no prior gifts or inheritances from his or her parents).  </p><p>  The fact that farms with a market value of up to &euro;2,250,000 can be transferred to a child without any charge to CAT arising reflects the Governments recognition of the central importance of agriculture to the overall economy and to the sustaining of rural communities. </p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax </b></p><p>  Section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for relief from capital gains tax (&quot;CGT&quot;) on transfers of businesses or farms by parents to their children, subject to certain conditions being met.  The meaning of &quot;child&quot; for the purposes of this relief is extended to include a child of a deceased child, a nephew or niece who has worked full-time in the business or farm for a period of 5 years prior to the disposal.  It also includes a foster child who was under the care of and maintained at the expense of the individual making the disposal for a period of 5 years (or periods which together amounted to 5 years) up to the time such foster child reached the age of 18.</p><p>  Broadly, the relief applies where the business or farm has been owned and used by an individual for business or farming purposes for a period of at least 10 years prior to the disposal.  The relief is intended to encourage early transfer of businesses or farms from parents to their children. Accordingly:</p><p>  - Full relief is available in the case of an individual aged 55 but under 66, who disposes of a business or farm to his or her child or a child of his or her civil partner.</p><p>  - Full relief is also available in the case of an individual aged 66 or over who, on or before 31 December 2013, disposes of a business or farm to his or her child or a child of his or her civil partner.</p><p>  - In relation to disposals made on or after 1 January 2014, where the individual making the disposal is aged 66 years or over full relief is available on disposals where the market value of the qualifying assets is &euro;3 million or less.  If the market value is over &euro;3 million   the relief is limited to the gain on an amount of &euro;3 million. </p><p>  Where an individual is disposing of land used for farming to his or her child and the consideration for its disposal consists in whole or in part of other land, the individual acquiring this other land will be treated as having acquired the land at the time and for the consideration that the child originally acquired it and to have farmed it for the same period that the child farmed it. </p><p>  There is a provision for a clawback of the relief where the assets transferred to the child are disposed of by the child within 6 years of the date of transfer.  In any such case, the capital gains tax which would have been charged on the transferor, if the relief had not applied, is assessed and charged on the child, in addition to the tax on any gain made by the child on his or her disposal of the assets.  </p><p>  Where a CAT charge and a CGT charge arise on the same event in relation to the same property the CGT is allowed as a credit against the CAT due.  The credit is withdrawn where the asset is disposed of within two years of the gift or inheritance. </p><p><b>Stamp Duty</b></p><p>  The transfer of farmlands normally attracts a charge to stamp duty at the rate of 2% on the market value of the lands transferred.  A reduced rate of 1% applies in the case of a transfer, on or before 31 December 2014, where the transferee is related to the transferor in one of other of the following ways: </p><p>  &quot;as a lineal descendant, parent, grandparent, step-parent, husband or wife, brother or sister of a parent or brother or sister, or lineal descendant of a parent, husband or wife or brother or sister, or is, as respects the person or each of the persons immediately theretofore entitled, his or her civil partner, the civil partner of either of his or her parents or a lineal descendant of his or her civil partner&quot;</p><p>  There is also an exemption from stamp duty where the transferee is a young trained farmer.  To qualify as a young trained farmer, the transferee must be under 35 years at the date of the transfer and must also be the holder of specified educational qualifications as set out in Section 81AA and Schedule 2, 2A and 2B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  This exemption applies where the transfer is executed on or before 31 December 2015.</p></reply>

If the system is to meet increasing demands for knowledge, innovation and human capital, higher education institutions need to have a strong strategic focus and mission direction underpinned by a new relationship of accountability with the state. I recently announced major restructuring of the higher education system to introduce greater coherency, collaboration and consolidation of provision at regional and national level. </p><p>  Also being implemented are new system governance arrangements that will ensure that all higher education institutions will be held accountable for their performance against our national priorities and stated system objectives. These changes should improve quality outcomes better access, transfer and progression opportunities for growing numbers of students in a more streamlined and efficient system.  In addition, as the Deputy is aware, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) is undertaking a study on the sustainability of the current funding system for higher education. This study was initiated at my request and an initial report has been published. This report makes it clear that immediate work is required to prepare for a longer term approach to a system that can be maintained through a sustainable funding base which will be able to address the continual expansion of the sector while protecting quality of education. The HEA is continuing its work in this area and I will be advised further as this work progresses. The report will help inform the decision-making as to the future funding of the sector.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>  It has not been recommended that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the mild general learning difficulty range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.</p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

However, the NCSE also considers that there are concerns in relation to some aspects of our current system, under the headings of Enrolment, Assessments, and the Supports for children with Special Educational Needs and their allocation. The Report makes 28 detailed recommendations which the NCSE feels would help to address these issues.  The recommendations in the Report are both interesting and significant. They deserve in-depth and detailed examination and exploration. Accordingly, I have asked my Department to carefully review the recommendations and report back to me on them.  The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. This proposal will then be considered by my Department.  I am very conscious that in making any changes to our supports for children with Special Educational Needs, we also need to protect the gains we have made. I would therefore like to give an assurance that consultation will be a key aspect in the implementation of any of these recommendations.</p></reply>

This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or Reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools.  The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos.  Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities does present as a particular challenge especially in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby.  The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.</p><p>  A Value for Money examination of small schools is being carried out and my Department expects to publish the analysis and findings in the near future.  I hope that this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in looking at the challenges ahead and how best to make provision for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.  My Department and I will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Protestant or Reformed churches, in relation to education provision for all areas.</p></reply>

The SEC has advised me that there were also errors on 3 other Mathematics papers, both Leaving and Junior Certificate, provided to candidates this year.  The SEC acknowledges that these errors may have caused confusion and distress for some candidates and has apologised publicly.</p><p>  One of the key objectives of the SEC is the provision of an examinations system of the highest possible quality.  Although the SEC has in place a range of procedures to enhance reliability and to minimise error, it is an unfortunate fact that errors can occur on examination papers from time to time.  When errors occur, the SEC must focus on two issues.  First, it seeks to ensure that no candidate is disadvantaged as a result of the error.  Therefore, the impact of these errors on students' answers will be taken into account by the Chief Examiner when finalising the marking schemes for these exams.  The marking schemes will, as usual, be published along with those in all other subjects after the issue of results, in mid-August in the case of the Leaving Certificate and mid-September for Junior Certificate.  Leaving Certificate students can view their marked examinations scripts to see how the published marking scheme has been applied to their work, while all students have the option of appealing their results.  Then, in the context of the specific error, the SEC reviews its existing processes and procedures in order to implement measures to strengthen the quality assurance underpinning the preparation of examination papers.</p><p>  I have asked the SEC to report to me on this issue.</p></reply>

In line with these recommendations and in preparation for the 2013/14 academic year, both the online application system and the application assessment process have been further developed to enhance their effectiveness and to deal with the difficulties experienced in year one.</p><p>  A number of new initiatives will make the application process more efficient this year including: direct information sharing between SUSI and Government agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the General Register Office and the Central Applications Office.  These links should significantly reduce the number of documents required from applicants themselves.  In addition the staff resources recommended by the review have already been sanctioned.  The resources include three additional management posts and some 23 (whole time equivalent) additional processing staff.  This will help to ensure that qualifying students have their applications assessed as quickly as possible.  SUSI has also significantly developed its training programme to meet the training needs of new and existing staff.</p><p>  In addition, the closing date will be a month earlier to facilitate earlier application and decision on a grant application.  Also SUSI is working closely with all third level institutions to improve the payment process for the 2013/14 academic year.</p><p>  The principal recommendations of the review can be broken down as follows:-</p><p>Process:- Reduce the volume of documentation sought from applicants;- Develop an online renewal application system;- Set key calendar dates for the SUSI application process;- Further segregate applications into specialised sections;- Collect key data from applicants earlier in the process;- Improve training and scripts for the SUSI support desk;- Develop an eligibility estimator for applicants use;- Further develop operational KPI (Key Performance Indicator) and Reporting systems.</p><p>  Management and Resources:- Enhance management resources;- Increase staff resources;- Develop core staff;- Re-employ experienced temporary staff.</p><p>ICT Systems:- Develop the SUSI grants system, to be a fully web-based integrated automated system;- Develop data information sharing links with Government bodies and agencies-Continue investment in IT development and capacity;- Develop an online self service tracker system for applicants;- Continue to develop the Management Information Service capacity.</p><p>Communications:- Develop a dedicated<i> www.susi.ie </i>website;- Enhance the communications strategy across the education stakeholders;- Improve the content of standard correspondence templates to applicants;- Develop a more targeted communications strategy for applicants from different sectors;- Set up a cross-Departmental stakeholders advisory group.</p></reply>

Although this school has had an aonad for the junior cycle since 2006, the number of students attending the aonad at junior cycle is very small.

Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks.  I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.</p><p>  The Association responded positively to my approaches and agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members.  The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years. </p><p>  The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.</p><p>All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments. </p><p>  The Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012 and the same level of funding will be provided in 2013. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I launched new &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot; on the 28th January last.  These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.</p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme. </p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books. </p><p>  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape. </p><p>  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.</p><p>  I have previously advised the Deputy that educational book publishers are independent private companies not under the direct control of my Department.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level.  Individual schools need to adopt a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.  At post primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two-point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. There are currently 55 schools out of 723 post-primary schools charging fees ranging from &euro;2,550 to &euro;10,065 for day pupils.</p><p>  At present, the State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme.  A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher applies in DEIS schools.  This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013. </p><p>  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme.  A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department was recently published and shows that the schools in question have &euro;81m in discretionary income that schools in the free scheme do not have.</p><p>  It is important to note that the report does not contain any policy proposals at this stage.  However, even after the Budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable. </p><p>  There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community on the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools.  This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or Reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p>  How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities does present as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures.  The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting small communities including minorities in maintaining their schools is part of that policy. </p><p>  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools.  The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos.  Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually.  This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  </p></reply>

In November 2011 the EFB indicated that it expected that </p><p>the funds available to it would be fully allocated on applications already received and accordingly it publicised that it would not be in a position to process any applications received after 30th November, 2011.  The EFB was dissolved with effect from 29th March 2013 and its remaining functions were taken over by the new Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board (RISF).   </p><p>  The RISF has been established to oversee the use of the cash contributions of up to &euro;110 million, pledged by the religious congregations, to support the needs of survivors of institutional child abuse, across a range of services, including mental health services, health and personal social services, education and housing services.  Eligibility to receive support from the Fund is restricted to those 15,000 former residents who have received awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board or equivalent Court awards. </p><p>  Relatives of survivors of abuse are not eligible to receive support from the RISF.  Having regard to the maximum funds available and the potential pool of applicants, I believe that this is the correct approach.  However I have agreed that the question of reviewing the eligibility under the RISF could be considered following two years of the operation of the Fund in the event of applications not resulting in a significant expenditure of the Fund.</p><p>  The Board held its inaugural meeting on 27th March and has commenced work on the arrangements to be put in place for the operation of the Fund.  Further publicity will be undertaken as the work of the Board progresses and a website with detailed information on the Fund's services will be developed.</p><p>  Due to confidentiality restrictions I am not in a position to comment on any individual application to the EFB.  I have however arranged to have the Deputy's query regarding the specific individual forwarded to the RISF Board requesting that it respond directly to him in relation thereto.</p></reply>

OPW also operates a number of visitor sites that have free admission but do not have a guided presence and consequently visitor numbers are not recorded at these sites.

It is intended to reduce the overall numbers of permits over time in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. The retirement of officials has no bearing on the extent of permits allocated by the Office of Public Works to the Departments and Agencies occupying accommodation at Dublin Castle.

The benefits arising from these central arrangements include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. I have previously stated that the impact of centralised procurement on local jobs had been carefully considered and that substantial dialogue with representatives of the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector had taken place.</p><p>  The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks can also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. </p><p>  In order to lighten the burden placed on SMEs when tendering the NPS operates in line with the best practise recommendations of the Department of Finance Circular 10/10. These steps include the use of proportional criteria for turnover and qualification, proportional insurance levels being set, ensures that there is no requirement for companies to submit all relevant paperwork (e.g. tax clearance certificates, auditors statements) upfront. The NPS also uses the eTenders website to ensure all companies can access the documentation and any clarifications quickly and freely.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has also developed standardised tender documentation to explicitly encourage the participation of SMEs. In these documents SMEs are actively encouraged to form consortia or similar business relationships. SMEs that believe the scope of the competitions are beyond their technical or business capacities are encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises. Through such relationships they can participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts that resulted from these competitions.</p><p>  Larger enterprises are also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from these tenders. For example Codex Ltd, the indigenous company which won the Stationery contract, is sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers. </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service. This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide. To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>  Whilst the government want better value for money for its substantial procurement spend they are also very anxious to see the SME sector actively participating in this public sector procurement program.</p></reply>

The primary goal of the Irish Presidency in the trade area was to advance the recommendations of the High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth and work towards agreement for a new generation Trade and Investment Agreement between the EU and the US.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Following considerable preparatory work by the Irish Presidency and intensive discussions at the EU's Trade Council, that I chaired on 14 June, EU Trade Ministers agreed negotiating directives that will enable the Commission to formally open detailed talks on this agreement.</font></p><p>  The negotiating mandate is broad based and positions the Commission to enter the talks with strong support from the Council to negotiate the best possible deal for Europe.  The mandate includes three key components: market access; regulatory issues and non-tariff barriers; and the rules which will govern the operation of any dispute settlement.  The scale of opportunity for economic growth and job creation from this agreement are potentially enormous.  The TTIP will be the largest bilateral agreement ever negotiated and offers significant opportunity to help our exporters and especially SMEs access the huge US market for goods and services.  It is estimated that EU GDP rise by between 0.5 % and 1 % in GDP when the agreement is fully implemented.  Other studies suggest 2 million jobs could be created across the developed economies of the OECD if we successfully conclude an agreement that is comprehensive and deeply liberalises the transatlantic marketplace.  The first round of negotiations are set to commence in Washington on 8 July.</p><p><b>Canada</b></p><p>  Ministers were briefed by the Commission on developments in the negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada.  Ministers confirmed full support for the Commission's approach in providing the impetus needed for finalising the talks and looked forward to a conclusion as soon as possible.</p><p><b>China</b></p><p>  Ministers also discussed the EU's strategic trade relations with China, in particular the proposed launch of negotiations on an investment agreement.  The EU is China's largest trading partner and both economies have much to gain from developing closer economic and trading connections.  </p><p><b>Other matters discussed</b></p><p>  The Council welcomed the successful conclusion of negotiations with the European Parliament on the so called &quot;Omnibus I &amp;amp; II&quot; Regulations which govern the procedures used for decision-making under the EU's common commercial policy.  The two draft regulations are aimed at modifying a number of regulations adopted between 1972 and 2009, adapting them to decision-making procedures provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in December 2009.  The Presidency reached an agreement on both Regulations with the Parliament on 5 June.</p><p>  The Council also discussed labour conditions in Bangladesh following recent tragic accidents and dreadful loss of life involving workers in garment factories.  The Council considered the potential for companies to use their codes of corporate social responsibility to help improve supply chain and working conditions as well as the opportunities for the EU to provide further technical assistance to the Bangladeshi authorities.</p></reply>

Where a crew member is paid a set wage, even where it may be supplemented by reference to a share in the catch, the worker is generally considered to be an employee and covered for all benefits and pensions at PRSI Class A.  Where a crew member is paid solely by reference to a share in the catch, they are considered to be insurable as a self-employed contributor at PRSI Class S.  This entitles them to the following benefits:</p><p>Widow's and Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner (Contributory) Pension </p><p>Guardian's Payment (Contributory) </p><p>State Pension (Contributory) </p><p>Maternity Benefit</p><p>Adoptive Benefit</p><p>Bereavement Grant.</p><p>  A share fisherman, or woman, who is classed as self-employed, may choose to pay an additional PRSI contribution at Class P.  The rate of Class P contribution is 4% of income in the preceding contribution year, in excess of &euro;2,500, or &euro;200, whichever is the greater amount.  This contribution is additional to the normal Class S payment made by the contributor.  In order to remain a Class P contributor a person must continue to be liable for Class S PRSI and ensure that all payments due are up to date.  The additional contribution entitles crew members to limited short-term benefits such as jobseekers benefit for up to 13 weeks, illness benefit for up to 52 weeks and treatment benefits.  These special arrangements recognise the particular circumstances associated with working in the fishing sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-18a.499.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061800059#WRK02400"><p>The recently published European Commission report, 'The Gender Gap in Pensions in the EU', deals with the gender gap in pensions across Europe and is the first study of its kind.  The study reveals that across the 27 EU Member States, women who are currently in receipt of pensions, receive average amounts which are 39% lower than those of men. For Ireland, the report indicates this pensions gender gap is 35%.  The report considers total income received from all sources including State, occupational and private pensions. I am pleased to note that for those on modest levels of income, which would broadly include the State pension, the report details that the gender pensions gap in Ireland is considerably <i>lower</i>   at 3.5% compared to the EU average of 48.7%.  This indicates that the Irish State pension has been successful in providing citizens with a basic level of income in a more gender balanced manner than our European counterparts.  </p><p>  However, for those on the highest incomes, which includes income from occupational and private pensions, the report indicates a gender pensions gap in Ireland of 44.7% compared to an EU average of 39.4%.  In providing a rationale for this pensions gender gap, the report notes that pensions in payment reflect yesterday's employment and social norms.  Thus, the effects of historical lower female employment rates and breaks in employment during careers are clearly apparent for women.</p><p>  In relation to the State pension, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in September 2012 confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  The Review shows that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to its redistributive nature.</p><p>  Many women now in retirement were home makers and rely on benefits available from their spouse/partner's pension scheme.  Also, women generally live longer than men.  These factors mean that these women can be more vulnerable in relation to retirement and as such women have been one of the priority groups targeted by the National Pensions Awareness Campaign in recent years.  The Homemakers Scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the work force for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  This can be beneficial for women who have taken time out of the work force for caring purposes.</p><p>  In relation to supplementary occupational and private pensions, both the labour market participation rates and supplementary pension coverage of women have improved greatly over the last number of years reflecting the development of Irish society: this will reduce the pensions gender gap for future retirees.  In 1987, female participation was 35% whereas in 2012 this was 52.4% (compared to 67.3% for men).   In Q1 2002, 45 per cent of females and 57 per cent of male workers had a private pension.  By Q4 2009, the rate for female workers had increased to 49 per cent and the rate for male workers had decreased to 53 per cent.</p><p>  However, notwithstanding this, it is estimated that just half of those in employment between the ages of 20 and 69 years have supplementary pension coverage.  As I have highlighted previously, this relatively low rate of coverage in Ireland and the adequacy of that coverage is a key concern of the Government.  That is why the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pensions system to progressively achieve universal coverage.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the OECD recently launched their Review of the Irish Pension System which I commissioned in recognition of a need for a focused review of Ireland's pension policy, taking economic conditions into consideration, and to provide recommendations for long-term reform.  One of the key findings of the OECD was to confirm that private pension coverage, both in occupational and personal pensions, is uneven and needs to be increased urgently with a view to improving the adequacy of pensions.  The review acknowledged that while the State pension has been successful in lifting older people out of poverty, the financial challenges of our changing demographics and aging population mean that we need to improve occupational and private pension coverage.   It is for this reason the introduction of an auto-enrolment system is currently being considered.  Such schemes are a very proactive way in which supplementary pension coverage can be increased, with more adequate pensions and improved outcomes in retirement for all workers including women.</p><p>  Detailed analysis of options advanced in the OECD report will be required before decisions can be brought to Government.  Consideration of the recommendations of this report will also inform further developments in pensions policy. <font color="#2F2F2F">I will bring proposals to Government in due course setting out my long term plans in this area.</font></p></reply>

In line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in June 2011, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues.  These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.</p><p>The group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports and its report on this first module of work was published in February.  The report makes important recommendations as to how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports through a two-tier payment so as to better target those who need these supports most while minimising work disincentives.  In its report the Advisory Group looked in detail at issues around the design and financial implications of a number of specific packages for the two-tier payment proposal, in terms of payment rates and withdrawal thresholds and tapers.  Under this two-tier payment approach, the Advisory Group suggests rebalancing and integrating child and family income support payments as follows:</p><p>A universal first-tier payment in respect of all children, which would replace the current child benefit payment.</p><p>A child income support supplement or second-tier payment for low-income families, which would replace the current qualified child increases components on all Social Protection weekly payments as well as the family income supplement (FIS). This second-tier payment would be proportionately reduced as income increases and would be withdrawn for families on a higher income.</p><p>The Group used a specific package (Package A) in a way that would illustrate the practical effects and operation of the payment.  This package consisted of a rate of &euro;25 per week for the first tier payment and &euro;38 per week for the second tier payment.  A threshold of &euro;480 per week or &euro;25,000 a year was set above which the second tier payment would be withdrawn at a rate of 20% as income increased.</p><p>The Group emphasised that it was not recommending a particular package for the two-tier payment as this is ultimately a matter for Government should such an approach be decided upon. In effect, I note that the Group&rsquo;s report uses this illustrative package and other packages to explore the ways in which such a reform would operate and the effect on different household types.  It was acknowledged in the report that under the proposals, certain households, including some low-income households currently in receipt of FIS, could lose out financially if the illustrative package was implemented in that way.  This is because FIS has a dual role not only as a child income support but also as an in-work support for parents on low incomes.  Given this dual nature of the payment, the Advisory Group undertook to give further consideration to this issue in the context of its examination of working age supports, an issue which the Group is currently progressing.  It is also important to note that not all families would lose out as some low income families who are currently not entitled to FIS, due to the hours worked condition or the employee condition, would stand to gain.  For this reason, I have no specific comments on the effect of the illustrative package on the family types mentioned in the questions but prefer to consider this issue when the final report of the Group is submitted to me and when the consultation process is complete.</p><p>The design of the proposed payment means that any number of variations of illustrative packages is possible.  In order to ensure proper consideration of this approach and through my Department&rsquo;s participation on the Advisory Group, I ensured that the effects of alternative scenarios would be considered and their impact is summarised in Appendix 8 of the Advisory Group&rsquo;s report.  Subsequent to the publication of the report, I also asked my Department to undertake further analysis particularly around using an income threshold of &euro;35,000 a year (close to annual equivalent of weekly average wage) and &euro;41,800 a year (income point at which the marginal tax rate is applied for a married/civil partnership couple).</p><p>In relation to the scenarios identified in question 28678/13, I attach a tabular statement summarising the results.</p><p>Consultation with stakeholders is an important source of views for the Advisory Group in fulfilling its mandate.  It also provides interested parties with an opportunity to make submissions on this topic.  The response of the End Child Poverty Coalition to the Advisory Group&rsquo;s report on child and family income supports has been submitted to my Department.  I also recently met with representatives of the Coalition to discuss their submission and listened to their views with interest as with part of the overall consultation process.  Given a range of complex issues involved with this proposal, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the broader policy debate on this important issue for families and their children.</p><p><b>Table: Alternative scenarios requested in Parliamentary Question 28678/13</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Description of household</th><th>Child and family income support from existing payment structure</th><th>Child and family income support from proposed two-tier child and family income support payment</th><th>Potential loss from illustration of Package A</th></tr><tr><td>Couple, single earner earning &euro;100,000 a year with 3 children and in receipt of child benefit</td><td>&euro;5,040</td><td>&euro;3,900</td><td>&euro;1,140</td></tr><tr><td>Couple, single earner earning &euro;26,000 a year with 3 children and in receipt of child benefit and FIS</td><td>&euro;12,528</td><td>&euro;9,628</td><td>&euro;2,900</td></tr><tr><td>Lone parent with one child earning &euro;20,000 a year and receiving the one parent family payment, including QCI, child benefit and FIS</td><td>&euro;4,634</td><td>&euro;3,276</td><td>&euro;1,358</td></tr></table></p></reply>

An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment and the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient's income. In line with this policy, the current Social Welfare legislation generally precludes changing the FIS rate within the 52 week payment period. However, as an exceptional measure, it is proposed to introduce regulations shortly to enable entitlement to FIS to be reviewed during the 52 week period, commencing from July 2013, so that former OFP recipients in receipt of FIS will have it increased in light of the termination of their OFP due to the age of the youngest child. The FIS payment may be increased to compensate for 60% of the loss of the OFP payment.</p><p>The following table provides indicative examples of a lone parent, with one child, and with net earnings of &euro;200, &euro;300, &euro;400 per week, who will be transitioning to the FIS scheme after their entitlement to the OFP payment ceases.  There is a maximum earnings threshold of &euro;425 for receipt of OFP so for a lone parent earning &euro;500 per week, OFP is not payable.</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Net earnings</th><th>OFP</th><th>FIS</th><th>Total OFP income (earnings plus OFP and FIS)</th><th>Total loss</th></tr><tr><td>Payment with OFP</td><td>&euro;200.00</td><td>&euro;180.30</td><td>&euro;75.42</td><td>&euro;455.72</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Payment without OFP and with FIS  re-rated</td><td>&euro;200.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;183.60</td><td>&euro;383.60</td><td>&euro;72.12</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Payment with OFP</th><th>&euro;300.00</th><th>&euro;130.30</th><th>&euro;45.42</th><th>&euro;475.72</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Payment without OFP and with FIS  re-rated</td><td>&euro;300.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;123.60</td><td>&euro;423.60</td><td>&euro;52.12</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Payment with OFP</th><th>&euro;400.00</th><th>&euro;80.30</th><th>&euro;15.42</th><th>&euro;495.72</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Payment without OFP and with FIS  re-rated</td><td>&euro;400.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;63.60</td><td>&euro;463.60</td><td>&euro;32.12</td></tr></table></p><p>Please not that the earnings threshold allowed for receipt of OFPT is &euro;425 and so in this case OFP would not have been payable</p><p><table><tr><th>Payment with OFP</th><th>&euro;500.00</th><th>&euro;0.00</th><th>&euro;3.60</th><th>&euro;503.60</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Payment without OFP and with FIS  re-rated</td><td>&euro;500.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;3.60</td><td>&euro;503.60</td><td>&euro;0.00<br /></td></tr></table></p><p>The jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement, I am introducing in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous) Bill 2013, will be available to former OFP recipients who continue to be parenting alone and who have a<b> </b>  youngest child aged under 14 years. The arrangement exempts these customers from the jobseeker's allowance (JA) conditionality that requires them to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work. I am introducing these arrangements in recognition of the difficulties that these lone parents may face in balancing their caring responsibilities towards their young children with the eligibility requirements of the JA scheme. These arrangements only extend to those continuing to parent alone. Should a former OFP recipient no longer be parenting alone then there would be no rationale for them to benefit from the exemptions to the JA conditionality. In these circumstances they would be treated the same as any other parent, who is in receipt of JA and who is required to meet the full JA conditionality.</p></reply>

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments. The Revised Estimates for my Department provide for e<font color="#2F2F2F">xpenditure on FIS of almost &euro;230 million in 2013.</font> There are currently 40,593 families benefiting from the FIS scheme.  Data on those who potentially qualify for FIS but who do not claim is not available from administrative data sources. In recent years, there has been a growth in the FIS claim load although it is not apparent whether this reflects better take-up or other factors. The Department continues to improve available information about the FIS payment and a comprehensive and easy to understand information booklet and application form are readily available on the Department's website. In the past, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has produced estimates based on household income surveys that suggest relatively low take-up of FIS among potentially eligible households but these estimates have not been recently updated.</p></reply>

There is an EU Stabilisation and Association agreement with Serbia in place which covers, amongst other things, cooperation in matters of social security. However, the social security provisions are not yet in force and a decision of the EU Stabilisation and Association Council would be needed to put this aspect of the agreement into operation. International agreements on social security, including the agreement mentioned above, generally deal with issues relating to long-term contributory payments such as invalidity and old age pensions. Non-contributory payments are not usually dealt with in such agreements and are provided in accordance with domestic legislation only and are not exportable. Accordingly, an Irish citizen living in Serbia would need to satisfy the legislation of that country in order to receive any payment similar to disability allowance there.</p></reply>

It was introduced in 1999 to replace Smallholders Unemployment Assistance&rsquo;for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work. Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes. In Budget 2013 two measures were announced, which were implemented in April 2013, which bring the farm assist scheme into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons by increasing the amount of means from self-employment, which is assessed against the claimant from 85% to 100%; and by discontinuing the means testing disregards for child dependents of claimants. Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues, due for example to bad weather, can ask his/her local social welfare or Intreo office to review the level of means applying to his/her claim. The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income and looks at gross income, less any expenses necessarily incurred, from farming. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year. However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.</p><p>  I met with a delegation from the Irish Farmers Association on 15 May 2013 to discuss a range of issues, including difficulties arising as a result of fodder shortages and the operation of the farm assist scheme generally. Arising from that meeting officials from the Department have held further discussions with the Irish Farmers Association and further contacts are planned.</p><p>  Any changes to the scheme would be a matter for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Since its inception, some 10,250 people have been provided with work with 5,483 currently working on T&uacute;s. T&uacute;s was expanded in the last budget to enable an additional 2,500 per annum to participate. A person cannot apply to participate on T&uacute;s. All selection is undertaken by random processes conducted at local level by the Department of Social Protection. The selection is focused on those on the Live Register for a year or more and in receipt of a jobseeker's payment who have more limited job or work placement opportunities. Participants are encouraged and facilitated to engage in work, while participating on T&uacute;s with a range of flexibilities allowed within the contract to work 19 and a half hours per week. If a participant receives an offer of work for a short period then they are allowed to temporarily leave T&uacute;s and return at a later date to complete their full 52 week placement. Participants can terminate their engagement on T&uacute;s at any time to take up full-time work as long as they do not seek to return to the live register. Casual workers, including professional actors, who apply for or receive some level of jobseekers payment are generally not selected for participation on T&uacute;s. My understanding of the particular circumstances of the jobseeker that the Deputy has enquired about is that the he has not been designated as a casual worker by the Department given the limited amount of acting he has undertaken in recent years and therefore qualifies for selection for T&uacute;s.</p></reply>

The unemployment rate for young people has fallen from 29.7% to 26.6% over the same period. This downward movement in unemployment differs from the trend in the EU as a whole, where youth unemployment has continued to rise. In the most recent 12-month period, virtually all the decline in youth unemployment was accounted for by a fall in the number of young people who were out of work for a year or more. It is to be hoped that this trend will continue as the economy recovers. However youth unemployment continues to present a major challenge for Ireland as it does for most Member States. </p><p>  Recognising the urgency required in tackling the challenge of youth joblessness, the EPSCO Council quickly agreed on the Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee in February.  The Government and my Department were at the forefront of securing agreement on the adoption of the EU Council Recommendation on the Youth Guarantee. </p><p>  The Recommendation is that Member States should:</p><p><i>Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education</i>  .</p><p>  As part of the European Council agreement on the 2014 - 2020 EU Budget, it was decided, in association with the agreement on the Youth Guarantee, to provide &euro;6 billion for a new Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment. This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line. At the EU level, the Irish Presidency is supporting proposals for payments of the &euro;6bn youth employment initiative to be frontloaded. These proposals will be discussed under my chairmanship at  the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) in Luxembourg this week and will subsequently form part of the discussions at Heads of State level.  </p><p>  It is recognised, both in the Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State. At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented. </p><p>  In these circumstances, it is suggested that the best way of maintaining the momentum generated by the adoption of the Recommendation would be for each Member State now to commit to adopting, by the end of 2013, concrete plans for the implementation of the Guarantee. </p><p>  For our own part, the Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013. The Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland.</p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  While recent trends have been positive in this regard, the implementation of a Guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</p><p>  Development of an implementation plan will include identification of the costs of implementation, and how it is envisaged that these will be met (how much can be provided from domestic sources, and what is the likely need from EU funds, e.g. ESF and YEI). </p><p>  In terms of a 'bottom up approach' to implementation, we have sought funding from the European Commission for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area of north Dublin. Numerous organisations, such as IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland, have agreed to participate in this pilot.  A Local Implementation Group will be central to the Ballymun project. The Local Implementation Team will comprise representatives of relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Social Protection, FAS, CDVEC, Ballymun Whitehall Area Partnership, Ballymun Job Centre/Local Employment Service Network, EQUAL Youth,  North Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Ballymun for Business, and a representative young person (to be identified). The lessons learned from this local implementation approach will then be disseminated at both a national and EU level.</p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Fraud Initiative which I launched in September 2011 further articulates this overarching policy objective.  A key priority is to ensure that fraudulent activity within the social welfare system is vigorously prevented and combatted. The approach is one which is aimed at highlighting the rights but importantly also the responsibilities of social welfare recipients. </p><p>  The Initiative recognises the value of the Department working closely and collaboratively with other agencies to ensure that social welfare abuse is comprehensively deterred and detected. The approach taken by the Department is frequently reviewed and is regularly adjusted to concentrate on the areas of greatest risk, based on its operational experience and credible information received from industry and business sectors.</p><p>  It is evident that the vast majority of social welfare recipients are legitimately entitled to the payments they receive.  The Department has made some significant inroads in tackling social welfare fraud.  </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s control work is measured in terms of control savings.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.  Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  Control savings refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work the social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.  Control savings do not include any cases of departmental or clerical error.  Control savings do not include any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of their means or circumstances, which resulted in a change to their rate of payment.  </p><p>  The Department recorded control savings of &euro;645m in 2011 and &euro;669m in 2012.  The savings target for 2013 is &euro;710 million which is an increase of &euro;40m on the savings achieved in 2012.  A total of just over &euro;180m was recorded in respect of control savings from January to end of April 2013.</p></reply>

The disability allowance (DA) scheme provides income support to people aged between 16 and 66 who have an injury, disease or physical or mental disability that has continued or may be expected to continue for at least one year and who are consequently substantially restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of the same age, experience and qualifications.  In addition, the domiciliary care allowance (DCA) represents a very important support to parents and guardians who live with, and care for, children with a disability.  I do not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to consider introducing separate social welfare schemes to address the needs of people with specific disabilities.  </p><p>  In regard to employment supports, the Department&rsquo;s supported employment programme, which operates nationwide under the &ldquo;EmployAbility&rdquo; banner, provides the services of a job-coach for those wishing to take up employment opportunities.

It is a lump sum and in most cases is paid automatically, but some people need to claim. The total amount of winter fuel payment can vary from &pound;100 - &pound;300 sterling having regard to age and household composition. Most payments are made between mid- November and December in a given year.  The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that people living outside the UK may be paid the winter fuel payment where they can demonstrate a &ldquo;genuine and sufficient link&rdquo; to the UK&rsquo;s social security system.</p><p>As I said in my reply of 8th   May, 2013, the implications of this ECJ judgment are currently being examined, in particular the implications for eligibility for the fuel allowance in Ireland.  The UK winter fuel allowance is contribution based and, as an entitlement has been established, then the UK would have first responsibility to pay the allowance.  As the fuel allowance here is a means tested payment, which is paid on the basis that an applicant is unable to provide for his or her own heating needs, we would have to take account of the receipt of the UK payment in assessing eligibility.  This would also be the case with other payments received from countries which impact on social welfare payments.  </p><p>  My officials have been in contact with the UK authorities to determine the number of people who are eligible for the UK payment.  On receipt of that information the best mechanism for addressing this issue will be determined.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.</p><p>  Priority for funding under the school meals locals projects scheme is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  The Department wrote to approximately 170 DEIS schools requesting expressions of interest in participating in the school meals scheme for the coming school year. To date, some 75 schools have expressed an interest in participating in the scheme and are expected to join the scheme from September 2013.  </p><p>  The Department also contacted a further 11 schools/groups who had already made an application to join the scheme. These schools were invited to participate in the scheme for the remainder of the current school year. One group, a School Completion Programme in Bray Co. Wicklow, has accepted and is participating in the scheme since May 2013. This programme is providing a food club for children attending St. Fergal&rsquo;s Senior National School in Ballywaltram, Bray, Co. Wicklow.  It is expected that the remaining schools will join the scheme from September 2013.  The Department is currently considering all applications for the scheme for the coming academic year. </p></reply>

This followed a public request for expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced individuals in line with the procedures for appointment to State boards and bodies agreed by Government in May 2011. In response to this public request for expressions of interest, 172 applications were received through the Public Appointments Service (PAS) and the appointment was made following a rigorous selection process in accordance with the legislation governing appointments to the board. </p><p>  The other two appointments did not require public advertisement as one was the Department's representative to the Board, Ms. Fiona Ward, first appointed on 1 November 2011, and the other was the CIB's staff representative to the Board, Mr. David Stratton, who was appointed on 5 November 2012.  These appointments were made in accordance with the governing legislation: the Comhairle Act 2000, as amended by the Citizens Information Act 2007.  </p><p>  There are currently two vacancies on the Citizens Information Board. A public request for expressions of interest in March 2013 resulted in 76 applications being received through the Public Appointments Service (PAS). Appointments will be made in accordance with the legislation on completion of the selection process. </p><p><b>Pensions Board</b></p><p>  Under the current structure, there are two vacancies on the Pensions Board. No appointments have been advertised or made by me to the Pensions Board since I took office.</p><p>  The Public Service Reform Programme provides for a critical review of the integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator, and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman.   The Critical Review Group established to carry out this review has finalised its report, the recommendations of which have been accepted by Government. </p><p>  The key recommendation from the critical review in relation to Board membership is that the governance of the Pensions Board will be restructured with two distinct arms, one of which will be a three-person Pensions Commission, including an independent Chair, to provide oversight of pensions regulation, and the other a separate unpaid Pensions Council with a majority of members representing consumer interests and which will advise the Minister on pensions policy.  </p><p>  The relevant legislative measures to implement the changes to the governance structure of the Pensions Board are being provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013, which is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p><p><b>Social Welfare Tribunal</b></p><p>  The Board of the Social Welfare Tribunal is appointed for a three year term.  It consists of a Chairperson and four ordinary members, two of whom are nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and two by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC), in accordance with legislation.</p><p>  There have been 6 appointments to the board since March 2011. One of the ICTU members of the Tribunal resigned in 2011 and, on ICTU's nomination, a replacement member was appointed from 24 October 2011. </p><p>All appointments were due for renewal on 4th October 2012. Four members of the previous board, and one new person nominated by IBEC, were appointed to the new board, by me, effective from the 5<sup>th</sup>  of October 2012. Both bodies had forwarded their nominations, which I duly approved and appointed.  The Chairperson is sourced by the Department of Social Protection by way of a recommendation from the Labour Court with regard to a particular candidate's suitability.  The Chairperson, who was re-appointed in 2012, has held the position since 2003.  He is a former Rights Commissioner with extensive experience in dispute resolution and has been proven to hold all of the qualifications, skills and competencies necessary for the position.  </p><p>  None of these positions were filled on foot of public applications as, due to the nature of the work of the Tribunal, they are not subject to the new procedures. The Tribunal deals with entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance where a claim is refused because it is considered to be connected to a trade dispute.  The board is therefore made up of individuals deemed to be representative of both employers and employees, hence the nominations from both IBEC and ICTU.  The Chairperson, in the position since 2003 and with all the necessary experience, qualifications and skills, had indicated his willingness to continue in the role and was duly reappointed. </p><p>  The revised Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies does not apply to the Social Welfare Tribunal due to its structure and purpose. </p><p>  There are no vacancies on the Board of the Tribunal.</p></reply>

It was introduced in 1999 to replace &lsquo;Smallholders Unemployment Assistance&rsquo; for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work. Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues can ask his/her local social welfare / Intreo office to review the level of means applying to his/her claim.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income and looks at gross income, less any expenses necessarily incurred, from farming. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  In the case of new entrants or persons changing from one type of farming to another the assessment looks at all expected annual income and is based on normal output and costs appropriate to normal stock levels, capacity, and market trends.</p><p>  It may be noted that payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme or Special Area of Conservation schemes are assessed separately from other farm income. With regard to this income the first &euro;2,540 is disregarded, then 50% of the balance and related expenses are disregarded - with the balance being assessed as means.</p></reply>

The average number of staff employed was 48. </p><p>  In relation to amalgamation, the Public Service Reform Plan, designated two public institutions engaged in the oversight and operation of the Irish pension system for a critical review:</p><p>- The Pensions Board with a view to integrating its regulatory functions within the Central Bank </p><p>- The Pension Ombudsman with a view to amalgamating it with the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>  A Steering Group chaired by Mr Richard Hinz of the World Bank, (comprised of senior representatives of the affected institutions, the Pensions Board, the Central Bank, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman, the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Departments of Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Finance) was established to undertake a review of the proposed amalgamations.</p><p>  In relation to the Pensions Board, the recommendation of the Steering Group was not to integrate the regulatory function with the Central Bank at this time. The Steering Group did make recommendations in relation to the governance structure of the Pensions Board and these were approved by Government. The governance changes are as follows: </p><p>- Replace the current 17 person paid board with two bodies, a body which will provide operational oversight of the regulatory function with an independent chair and 2 ex officio members of government bodies and a policy advisory board (the Pensions Council);</p><p>- The Pensions Council will be comprised of unpaid members (up to 12) that encompass the balanced representation of the full range of relevant stakeholders, and act as an advisory body to the Minister.  The Pensions Regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Social Protection will be permanent members of the Pensions Council. </p><p>- The Pensions Council will report to the Minister/Department of Social Protection;  </p><p>- Nominating bodies as currently set down in the legislation will be removed;</p><p>- The Pensions Board will be renamed the Pensions Authority to ensure public awareness and clarity of its role and functions;</p><p>- The Chief Executive of the Pensions Authority will be known as the Pensions Regulator.</p><p>  These amendments are currently being brought in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013. </p><p>  These changes represent a modernisation of the governance structure of the Pensions Board - which was established in 1990 with a social partnership structure.  The new structure provides for separation of the regulatory oversight of occupational pensions from the policy advice. </p><p>  Policy advice will be provided by the Pensions Council which will be composed of stakeholder representatives. The nomination structure in the existing legislation is being removed and guidelines will be developed to provide for a broader, more consumer based representation on the Pensions Council.  Savings of approximately &euro;100,000 will be generated by the replacement of the paid Board members with unpaid representatives.</p></reply>

Both are included in a list of species protected under the EU Habitats Directive.  Consequently, Ireland is obliged to monitor and report on their status, including in relation to their population, every six years. The next such report is due this month.<font color="#004080"> </font>The assessments of seals will be available shortly on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at .</p><p>  My Department has carried out a number of surveys, including aerial surveys, on the population of both the common and grey seals in the past number of years.

Licences are issued in response to specific applications and each application is considered on its merits. This redress is available to individual fishermen to control damage to fisheries by seals at particular locations. </p></reply>

Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and my Department has no role to play in its executive or funding decisions. Full information on the Council's funding decisions is made available on their funding decisions database on their website www.artscouncil.ie.</p><p>  Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, heritage, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of these sectors. While I know that the Deputy appreciates the funding difficulties facing all Departments at this time, I can assure him that I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for these sectors. </p><p>  There is no specific funding provision in my Department's Vote to support ethnic groups.  There is, however, a philanthropic initiative for arts and culture organisations designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources. The initiative provides an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  </p><p>  A total of &euro;210,000 is available this year to arts organisations under the scheme.  A majority of the funding will be directed towards arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  In 2013, it is hoped that the Philanthropy Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fundraising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education.  </p></reply>

In consequence, as the Deputy will appreciate, the complexity of the ownership of fishing rights means that the position varies from lake to lake.  The owners of fishing rights and their agents have a right to reasonable access.  The allocation of the right to fish is a matter for those who own fishing rights on particular lakes or rivers.  In some instances ownership of fishing rights, going back significantly in time, is fragmented and can be ambiguous, with some lakes being in State ownership and some in private ownership.  My Department has no role in the allocation of privately owned fishing rights, or in investigating fishery right title.</p><p>  Some fishing rights are clearly identified property rights and are &lsquo;rated fisheries&rsquo; whereby the fishery owner pays an annual rate (similar to a commercial rate) to the State via Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) &ndash; in these instances the fishery would normally be identified on their property title.  There are other lakes where the fishing rights are owned by the riparian property owners.</p><p>  IFI is working with my Department on a major project to modernise, consolidate and simplify the law pertaining to inland fisheries.  The review of legislation is currently at the public consultation stage and my Department will be examining proposals improving access to waters as part of this process as well as seeking to clarify, in as far as possible, the issue of ownership of fishing rights.</p><p>  A key objective of this process is to put in place the legislative basis to allow IFI to develop the potential of the sector, mainly by increasing the number of anglers utilising the resource, empowering stakeholders to take an active role in the development of the resource and to maximise the returns from the inland fisheries resource to local communities and the State.  </p></reply>

The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  Ireland is now therefore moving to a new phase of public and private sector investment in broadband in Ireland which will see significantly improved speeds delivered across the country.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan.</p><p>  Some of the key developments in the short and medium term are as follows:</p><p>- Eircom launched its next generation broadband services on 16<sup>th</sup> May last, with speeds of up to 70Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises.  By the end of this year, eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses.  It has a target to pass 1.2m premises by June 2015.</p><p>- UPC is continuing with its investment in the cable network, which should see 750,000 homes able to access services at data speeds of at least 150 Mbps by 2015.</p><p>- Other fixed operators also continue to invest in Local Loop Unbundling (LLU).  BT Ireland now supplies broadband access to both Vodafone and Sky Ireland, and along with other operators, is also investing in fixed infrastructure.</p><p>- Mobile wireless operators are making plans for the rollout of 4G services later this year.  The rollout of 4G will facilitate significantly increased mobile broadband speeds.</p><p>- ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services.</p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department will shortly embark on a formal mapping exercise to identify the areas of the country to be targeted in the State-led investment under the Government's National Broadband Plan to ensure the provision of high speed broadband services where the commercial market will not deliver.  This exercise will inform an EU State Aids application in respect of the State-led intervention and is a necessary prerequisite for State Aids approval.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses, including all those situated in the areas of Lucan, Clondalkin, Rathcoole, Saggart, Newcastle and Palmerstown, can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  The Deputy may wish to contact commercial operators directly with a view to establishing what commercial services are available or planned in these areas, in the first instance.  </p></reply>

I have no statutory function in the matter of disconnections of electricity or gas customers regardless of the supply company involved.</p><p>  The CER provides quarterly and annual updates on the electricity and gas retail markets, including on disconnections on a national level, and further information may be found at: .</p><p>  Nevertheless, the number of disconnections is a matter of great concern to me as it is for the Government, the CER, voluntary organisations and suppliers.  The rise in disconnections in recent years has coincided with the economic recession, which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise.</p><p>  In line with the CER's Code of Practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options or plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a Pay As You Go Meter.  According to CER's published Electricity and Gas Retail Markets Report 2012, 14,713 Pay As You Go electricity meters were installed in 2012.  That report also states that there are approximately 18,000 token meters in operation. In the gas market, 12,730 Pay As You Go gas meters were installed in 2012, bringing the total to over 66,000 meters in place, including the old style keypad (prepayment meters).  In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement. </p><p>  I would strongly encourage any electricity and gas consumers who are in financial difficulty to engage with their suppliers and accept a Pay As You Go meter thus ending the possibility of being disconnected and not incurring further debts.  I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised, and only occur as a very last resort. </p><p>  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government's Affordable Energy Strategy, published last November, is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.</p><p>  In addition, the Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;18 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades in over 10,000 homes.</p></reply>

No other electricity supply company has to date chosen to enter the domestic market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff on a commercial basis, although the Commission for Energy Regulation invited them to do so.  In addition, no company has opted to offer, on a commercial basis, a feed-in-tariff for microgeneration of solar photovoltaic to the commercial and industrial sectors.  Previously, a joint ESB/Electric Ireland microgeneration support scheme for the domestic sector offering a total of 19c/kwh (comprising &euro;10c/kwh from ESB Networks combined with the 9c/kwh from ESB Customer Supply (now Electric Ireland)) ran for 3 years from February 2009 to February 2012, and had a take up of between 500 and 600 installations.</p><p>  In view of falling technology costs, my Department has recently asked the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to update analysis on the costs of varying levels of support for microgeneration technologies, with a view to considering how the sector could be supported in the future.  This analysis will also cover non-tariff support mechanisms, the cost of which is not funded from the Public Service Obligation.  Financial tax incentives, introduced in 2008, are also available for a wide range of energy efficient equipment through the Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) scheme.  The scheme enables companies to claim 100% of the capital cost of certain energy efficient plant and machinery against corporation tax in year of purchase. The range of technologies covered by the ACA scheme has been expanded to cover electricity provision, including photovoltaic systems.</p></reply>

Using a fixed feed in tariff mechanism, the certainty afforded by a guaranteed minimum price allows developers to access finance for renewable developments. The REFIT schemes are funded by the Public Service Obligation (PSO) which is paid for by all electricity consumers. The REFIT schemes have been designed to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation in order to ensure Ireland meets the legally binding target of 40% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2020. </p><p>  In the second round of REFIT - REFIT 2 - a total of 4,000 MW can be supported.  The scheme is open to renewable generation constructed between the start of 2010 and the end of 2017. The current reference prices per megawatt hour for REFIT 2 is  &euro;69.23 for installations above 5 MW (large wind), &euro;71.66 for installations equal to, or below, 5MW (small wind), &euro;87.46 for hydroelectric projects and &euro;85.03 for biomass/landfill gas projects.</p><p>  The REFIT 3 scheme aims to incentivise the addition of 310MW of renewable electricity biomass capacity to the Irish grid, with a total of 200MW of this being new capacity in the anaerobic digestion and solid biomass areas.  Of this, 150MW will be high efficiency combined heat and power (CHP), using both anaerobic digestion and the thermochemical conversion of solid Biomass.  REFIT 3 also provide supports for up to 160MW from the co-firing of biomass with peat at Edenderry power station and potentially in future, subject to technical acceptance, at Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations.</p><p>  The 2013 REFIT 3 reference prices per kilowatt hour (kWH) are as follows:</p><p>  AD CHP less than or equal to 500 kW - 15.6c/kWh</p><p>  AD CHP &amp;gt;500 kW - 13.5c/kWh</p><p>  AD (non CHP less than or equal to 500 kW - 11.4c/kWh</p><p>  AD (non CHP) &amp;gt;500kW - 10.4c/kWh</p><p>  Biomass CHP less than or equal to 1500kW - 14.6c/kWh</p><p>  Biomass CHP &amp;gt;1500kW (1.5MW) - 12.5c/kWh</p><p>Biomass Combustion (including co firing in existing plant):</p><p>  For using energy crops - 9.9c/kWh</p><p>  For all other biomass - 8.8c/kWh</p><p>  In terms of reliefs, Section 62 of the Finance Act 1998 as amended provides for a scheme of tax relief for corporate investments in certain renewable energy projects.

Expert advice suggests that Ireland has the capability to achieve this national target from onshore renewable generation alone, with capacity to spare.  This means that there is potential for projects of scale onshore that are aimed at export markets.  It also means that our offshore wind resource can be developed as an export opportunity.</p><p>  The Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation that UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Edward Davey and I signed in January of this year, will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.</p><p>  The EU Directive provides a mechanism whereby renewable energy produced in one country can not only be exported to another but can also be counted towards meeting that other country&rsquo;s national target.  The electricity so exported is subtracted from the renewable output of the exporting state.  The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including the possibility of Ireland counting some of the export production towards meeting its own target, which is also allowed for under the Directive, are matters to be addressed in the coming year, and ahead of signing a potential Inter-Governmental Agreement, which would have to ensure no financial cost or risk to the Irish State or consumer.</p></reply>

Ireland will meet this target mainly by achieving significant increases in the use of biofuels with the increased use of electric vehicles also contributing a small percentage to the target.</p><p>  The Renewable Energy Directive specifies a set of sustainability criteria that must be applied to biofuels, before they can be counted towards a Member State&rsquo;s renewable energy in transport (RES-T) target.  Under these criteria biofuels may not be made from raw materials originating from tropical forests or recently deforested areas, drained peatland, wetland or highly biodiverse areas. However, the Directive currently does not account for Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC), where the growing of crops for biofuels may impact on land use change elsewhere.  A draft directive proposing amendments to a number of existing Directives including the Renewable Energy Directive to counteract the possible effects of ILUC is currently being progressed.  </p><p>  One of the proposals of the draft Directive involves placing a limit of 5%, in energy terms, from biofuels produced from certain feedstocks that Member States could use in meeting the 10% target.  Another proposal is to incentivise the production and use of certain other biofuels produced from feedstocks such as wastes, residues and non-food materials by allowing these biofuels to be counted more than once towards the 10% target.  It should be noted that, in 2012, around 55% of the biofuel placed on the market in Ireland was produced from wastes such as used cooking oil and tallow.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-18a.784.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061800059#WRQ00300"><p>The LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007 &ndash; 2013 commenced in February 2009 after a delay of more than two years which reduced the time available to allocate funding to less than five years rather than the original seven. Two main issues have impacted on the revised allocations recently notified to Local Development Companies (LDCs).   </p><p>  The first relates to overall Programme performance. During 2010 and 2011 it became evident that a significant number of LDCs who were contracted to deliver the Programme were not committing funds at the level required, to ensure that all the funding would be allocated by the December 2013 deadline. Similarly it became clear that a number of LDCs were more than capable of allocating additional funding if it was made available. </p><p>  In this regard, in January 2012 my Department notified all LDCs that the original allocations awarded in 2009 were no longer valid and that the Programme was being opened up on a &lsquo;first-come first served&rsquo; basis to all LDCs in order to ensure that all the available funding would be allocated to eligible projects within the timeframe allowed. All LDCs were encouraged to maximise the opportunity this created for them. All LDCs had an equal opportunity to maximise funding in their respective areas, and some companies availed of this more than others. </p><p>  The second issue relates to the change in co-financing rates. During 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for the LEADER elements of Ireland&rsquo;s RDP but only for expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013. This had the effect of reducing the available funding under the Programme from &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;370 million. </p><p>  In January 2013 in light of all the changes to the Programme it became necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the various measures of the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the LDCs, taking into account the level of commitments already entered into.   </p><p>  Using an estimated final programme allocation of &euro;370 million the total spend to date and outstanding contractual commitments under the Programme were established and deducted from the &euro;370 million. &euro;6 million was provided for the former MFG legacy files, new Gaeltacht projects and associated administration costs. Funding was also provided for projects that were greater than &euro;150,000 in value that had been submitted to my Department for assessment. The original percentage of the Programme which was awarded to each LDC in 2009 was then applied to apportion the remaining funding. Where an LDC would receive less than 80% of its original allocation, an adjustment was made to bring the revised allocation up to 80% of the original. </p><p>  In the case of Longford Community Resources the revised allocation represents a decrease of 19% from their original allocation. The redistribution of available funding was conducted in as fair and equitable a manner as was possible with many LDCs experiencing similar reductions. </p><p>  I am committed to the continued monitoring of this situation and my Department will conduct another formal review of commitments and expenditure levels at the end of August 2013. If LDCs are not performing with regard to the Programme commitment levels, allocations will again be revised in the context of maximizing commitments to the end of the Programme by December 2013. </p></reply>

As Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, I have no function in relation to the GMO licensing process in individual cases.  </p><p>  In July 2012, the EPA granted consent to Teagasc to carry out a field trial with genetically modified (GM) blight resistant potatoes in Carlow over a four year period from 2012 to 2016 inclusive. This field trial was granted subject to conditions and will be subject to ongoing inspections and reporting requirements.   </p><p>  Aside from this GM potato trial, there are currently no GM crops cultivated in Ireland either for field trial or for commercial purposes. The cultivation of GM crops on a commercial basis within the European Union is subject to a community authorisation procedure under the procedures set out under Directive 2001/18/EC on the Deliberate Release into the Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms and EU Regulation 1829/2003 on GM food and feed. The competent authorities in each Member State all participate in the decision making process.

The only two crops currently authorised for such cultivation within the EU have characteristics that are not relevant to Irish agriculture and industry. </p><p>  A proposal by the European Commission to amend the Deliberate Release Directive, which would allow Member States more choice in deciding whether or not to cultivate GMOs in their respective territories has not progressed since the March 2012 Environment Council, due to a blocking minority opposing the measure. </p></reply>

Under section 19 of the Act, it is prohibited to set the rent under a tenancy at a rate above the market rent at either the beginning of the tenancy or at any subsequent rent review.  Both tenants and landlords have the right to a review of rent, even where there is no provision to that effect in the tenancy agreement.  Such a review may not take place more frequently than once in each period of 12 months nor in the first 12 months of the tenancy. </p><p>  If non-compliance with the provisions of the Act relating to rent and rent reviews leads to a dispute between landlord and tenant either or both of the parties to the tenancy may refer the matter to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) for resolution.  The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits, and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination.  The Rent Tribunal, established under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) (Amendment) Act 1983, is the arbitrating body in the determination of the rent and other terms of tenancy of dwellings which were formerly rent controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts 1960-1981.  The Tribunal may determine new cases or may review cases previously determined by the District Court or by the Tribunal itself.  Since October 2009 the administrative functions of the Rent Tribunal have been carried out by the PRTB. </p><p>  With regard to local authority housing, local authorities set rents for social housing tenants based on their Differential Rents Schemes.  While it is a matter for each authority to determine an individual's rent, the principle of the scheme is that a household is charged a rent based on a proportion of their income.  I have no plans to introduce legislation in relation to rent control at this time.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Government has also decided that Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme and, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, will take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.  It is intended that the legislation to transfer statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water will provide for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements. </p><p>  It would be inappropriate to release estimates of the cost of the metering programme in advance of the completion of the ongoing competitive procurement process.  A pre-installation survey is currently being conducted by the local authorities to provide further information on the scope of the metering programme and this will identify those properties which already have boundary boxes and meters installed.  There will be no upfront charge for the installation of the meter.   </p><p>  The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them.  The Regulator will also be responsible for determining the framework for levying water charges.  An appropriate approach to charging customers will be put in place and a public consultation will take place as part of the regulatory process.  It has been decided, following the 9th Review of the Memorandum of Understanding by the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, that water charges will commence with effect from Quarter 4 2014.  It is expected, therefore, that Irish Water will issue the first bills to customers from January 2015. </p><p>  Irish Water will be required to have a range of options in place to assist householders who have difficulties in paying their bills.  Affordability issues will be addressed by my Department and the Department of Social Protection, in consultation with the Regulator, Irish Water and other stakeholders, in the context of developing a water pricing framework.  The agreed approach to affordability issues will then be reflected in the charging structure established by the Regulator.  It is important to distinguish between people who cannot afford to pay and people who refuse to pay.  It would be expected that Irish Water would pursue payment from customers who refuse to pay even when they have the financial capacity to pay the bill, and a range of options will also be put in place to this end, as is normal practice with other utility service providers.</p><p>  These matters will be addressed in legislation that is being prepared by my Department.</p></reply>

The Local Property Tax and Non Principal Private Residence Charge operate quite differently in many respects; however, in general, those properties which are liable for the Charge will also be liable for the Tax.  The amount of Local Property Tax incurred in respect of a liable property is based on that property's value, while the Non Principal Private Residence Charge is incurred on the basis of a flat rate of &euro;200 per liable property per annum.  Therefore, it is not appropriate to assume equivalence between the Charge and the Tax. Liability for the Charge will not be offset against the Tax.</p><p>  This year will be the final year of the operation of the Non Principal Private Residence Charge.</p></reply>

The scope of the remediation scheme is restricted to providing a solution for those homeowners whose homes are affected by significant pyritic damage and who have no other viable means to have their homes remediated.  It is not a compensation scheme and consequently the scope of the scheme does not extend to cover remediation works already undertaken.

Two main issues have impacted on the revised allocations recently notified to Local Development Companies.   </p><p>  The first relates to overall Programme performance.  During 2010 and 2011 it became evident that a significant number of Local Development Companies (LDCs) who were contracted to deliver the Programme were not committing funds at the level required to ensure that all the funding would be allocated by the December 2013 deadline.  Similarly it became clear that a number of LDCs were more than capable of allocating additional funding if it was made available.  In this regard, in January 2012 my Department notified all LDCs that the original allocations awarded in 2009 were no longer valid and that the Programme was being opened up on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis to all LDCs in order to ensure that all the available funding would be allocated to eligible projects within the timeframe allowed.  All LDCs were encouraged to maximise the opportunity this created for them.  All LDCs had an equal opportunity to maximise funding in their respective areas, and some companies availed of this more than others. </p><p>  The second issue relates to the change in co-financing rates.  During 2011, the European Commission approved a change in the maximum co-funding rate from 55% to 85% for the LEADER elements of Ireland's RDP but only for expenditure incurred in 2012 and 2013.  This had the effect of reducing the available funding under the Programme from &euro;427 million to an estimated &euro;370 million. </p><p>  In January 2013 in light of all the changes to the Programme it became necessary to carry out a comprehensive review of the level of commitments and expenditure across the various measures of the Programme in order to apportion the remaining funds among the LDCs, taking into account the level of commitments already entered into.  Using an estimated final programme allocation of &euro;370 million, the total spend to date and outstanding contractual commitments under the Programme were established and deducted from the &euro;370 million.  &euro;6 million was provided for the former MFG legacy files, new Gaeltacht projects and associated administration costs.  Funding was also provided for projects that were greater than &euro;150,000 in value that had been submitted to my Department for assessment.  The original percentage of the Programme which was awarded to each LDC in 2009 was then applied to apportion the remaining funding.  Where an LDC would receive less than 80% of its original allocation, bearing in mind that the overall Programme value has been reduced, an adjustment was made to bring the revised allocation up to 80% of the original. </p><p>  There are 35 LDCs contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.  LDCs make funding decisions in the context of their local development strategies, relevant EU Regulations and national rules and the resources available to them.  In line with the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to rural development my Department has no remit in relation to the selection of projects which are approved under the Programme.</p></reply>

The issue was considered again in 2008 when a Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) report on the matter was published.

The document was prepared by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department through a collaborative process, which included consultation with stakeholders. The intention is to ensure that Ireland continues to manage its fire risk effectively in accordance with current international best practice and that the successful approaches to fire safety, under which the level of fire fatalities recorded in 2012 was the lowest for four decades, are extended and consolidated. </p><p>  With a view to developing a common understanding in relation to terminology in risk management, relevant definitions are set out in KCS. In particular, the term &#8220;Risk Assessment<b>&#8221;</b>   as used in KCS is one stage of the systemic risk management process on which KCS is based. The National Directorate prepared a series of Task Analyses to show how the initial fire crew, including the incident commander, would work safely to undertake tasks normally associated with the range of fire scenarios set out in Appendix A to the document. This was developed by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) project team with the assistance of the Operations Research Committee, which assists the NDFEM with its work. The Operations Research Committee comprises fire service management and technical/operational expertise. Their work is overseen by the Management Board. </p><p>  Specifically on fire fighter safety, KCS recognises the importance of the twin duties on fire authorities under the Fire Services and Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation. An updated Fire Services Safety Management System (SMS) support document is being developed as part of the KCS implementation process (a draft is currently with stakeholders as part of the consultation process) to ensure that occupational health and safety in fire services is fully aligned with international best practise and the recently adopted local government SMS policy.   </p></reply>

This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector. </p><p>  AHBs are uniquely placed to help drive the achievement of the housing supply responses set out in the policy statement. However, the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. As such, I am developing an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement.   </p><p>  This framework is being developed in consultation with the sector and it will:   </p><p>  - assist approved housing bodies to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate an expanded remit;</p><p>  - provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies&rsquo; competences;</p><p> - place sustainable housing management policies and practices at the heart of a coordinated approach to the development of the sector.   </p><p>  An important step in this regard will be the publication in the coming weeks of a voluntary code for the regulation of AHBs. This code will be a first step towards a statutory regulatory framework that will protect the very significant State investment in the sector over the last two decades and will provide assistance to those working in the sector to meet the challenges ahead. It will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop this longer-term statutory framework t   o best support the enhanced role of AHBs. </p></reply>

As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee which will have lay representation.  </p><p>  In November 2011, the judiciary agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill. A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill, a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010. The observations of the sub-committee were conveyed to me by the Chief Justice on 8 May 2012. These observations were duly considered in my Department taking account of intervening developments and of current Government policy. Following this consideration, I conveyed the relevant drafting instructions to the Attorney General in November 2012.  Work on the drafting of the new Bill continues, therefore, in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel. Under the Government's Legislation Programme  publication of the Bill is expected later this year.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The appointment of six County Registrars as specialist judges will create the necessary ring fenced judicial capacity for personal insolvency applications without imposing an unnecessary additional burden on the Exchequer. </p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that in 2009 the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes recommended a reduction in the number of County Registrars from 26 to 15.   Since then three registrars have retired and have not been replaced.  It is intended the number will now reduce further, to a total of 17, following the appointment of six Specialist Judges who have recently been nominated by the Government. </p><p>  In 2009 a Working Group, the membership of which included a number of Registrars, found that with the reorganisation of management responsibilities, there was sufficient capacity and expertise to take on a range of additional functions with a view to speedier and more efficient administration of court business.   In this context it should be noted that the Service has put in place a series of work force planning measures over the last three years including the creation of multi-jurisdictional combined court offices under the management of a Chief Clerk.  This has created increased capacity for County Registrars and the Government very much appreciates the cooperation of these office holders in taking on additional functions, including acting as Vice Chairs of Employment Appeal Tribunals.    The Courts Service and my Department are currently considering the distribution of the work in consultation with the serving County Registrars.</p></reply>

Local Garda management is aware of incidents of anti-social behaviour in the area during the period referred to by the Deputy.  I am further informed that on Tuesday, 4 June 2013, a large group of up to 200 youths gathered on the East Pier in Howth. The majority of youths were well behaved, however approximately 30 youths had consumed alcohol. Local Garda&iacute; attached to Howth Garda Station monitored and patrolled the area and seized alcohol from youths and the youths concerned were dispersed. Local businesses were contacted by Garda&iacute; to appraise them of the situation and management at the local Supermarket agreed to remove alcohol from display. Garda&iacute; liaised with Fingal County Council to facilitate vehicular access to the beach to allow Garda&iacute; to patrol same. Liaison is continuing with the Howth Harbour Master to address the issues raised. Three persons were arrested and were dealt with by way of the juvenile diversion programme. Garda&iacute; remained on duty until all the youths had dispersed.</p><p>  On Saturday, 8   June 2013, an operation was mounted by Garda&iacute; as a result of information contained on Facebook suggesting a 'Rave' on Burrow Beach, Sutton. An Operational Policing Plan was put in place and additional resources were assigned to the Howth Garda Sub-District under direct supervision of the Superintendent, Raheny. Large amounts of alcohol were seized at local Dart stations and checkpoints were set up near the beach area. There were five Public Order Offences, four of which will be dealt with by way of juvenile referral and one by way of summons. There were no incidents of injury to persons or property reported. Garda&iacute; liaised with Fingal County Council and Iarnrod Eireann during this operation. </p><p>  Garda Operation Irene is a Regional Operational Plan which commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region on 1 June, 2013 and will continue until the 31 August, 2013. The operation incorporates a range of policing actions to be implemented at identified &ldquo;hot-spots&rdquo;, which with the advent of milder weather, longer evenings and school holidays, may experience an upsurge in anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol consumption.  This is a targeted operation to combat under-age alcohol consumption and consumption of alcohol in public spaces throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region through the enforcement of legislation regulating the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol as well as relevant public order legislation.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware of issues which can be associated with periods of extended good weather. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to meet these challenges and deploy additional resources where necessary. Local Garda management in the areas concerned is satisfied that sufficient resources were available to deal with instances of public disorder and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also satisfied that sufficient legislation exists to deal with such instances.  These include measures under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides Garda&iacute; with powers to deal with anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking, including exclusion orders in respect of premises and closure orders for licensed premises and catering outlets following anti-social behaviour related offences. In addition, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to Garda&iacute; to tackle the misuse of alcohol, including the power to seize alcohol in the possession of an under 18 year old which they suspect is for consumption in a public place.  Garda&iacute; may can also seize alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property. Fixed charge notices may be issued for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place. This option has the benefit of a more efficient use of Garda and Court resources, while also allowing an offender who complies with the notice to avoid a possible criminal record.</p></reply>

I am, however, assured that deployment and allocation of Garda resources is kept under continuing review to ensure optimum use is made of those resources.  The Deputy will also appreciate that we have seen very positive sustained improvements in the attitudes and behaviour of all road users which underpinned another record year in terms of road safety in Ireland in 2012.  Enforcement by the Garda authorities continues to focus on high risk behaviour and on identified vulnerable road users with a view to reducing the number of serious injury collisions and fatalities on our roads.  </p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out planned, unplanned and 'ad hoc' checkpoints, including Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) checkpoints as part of this effective, visible enforcement policy.  The number of checkpoints conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains high.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that 71,960 MAT checkpoints operated in 2012, compared with 70,861 in 2011 and 57,568 in 2010.  A total of 32,236 MAT checkpoints have been conducted to 12 June, 2013.  More than half a million tests MAT tests are carried out annually, which represents a substantial proportion of the driving public.  Furthermore, the outsourced safety camera networks provides 6,000 hours of additional enforcement per month with increased compliance across all of the safety enforcement zones, indicating a positive change in driver behaviour.</p><p>  I can also assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to conduct further specific targeted visible initiatives, such as the recent Operation Slowdown and related enforcement activity which took place over the recent June bank holiday weekend.  Awareness campaigns are also conducted as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ongoing commitment to work with all road safety partners and contribute fully to the effective implementation of the Road Safety Strategy 2013 - 2020. </p></reply>

The Act provides that the Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.</p><p>In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with the Courts Service regarding the number of children referred to the Children's Courts and I am informed that statistics are not compiled in the manner sought by the Deputy and the data could not be extracted without a disproportionate expenditure of staff time and resources which could not be justified in the circumstances.</p><p>I presume that in referring to the Juvenile Liaison Officers' (JLOs) supervision scheme, the Deputy is referring to the statutory Diversion Programme operated by the JLOs under Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 as amended. The Programme provides that, where a child commits a crime a report is submitted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Director of the Diversion Programme for a decision on whether to admit the child to the Programme.  Information and statistics on the operation of that Programme are contained in an &quot;Annual Report of the Committee Appointed to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Diversion Programme&quot;, which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas annually and is also published on the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) website www.iyjs.ie.  General statistics (no. of children referred, decision type) in the report are collated on a Garda divisional basis, while the top crime types are reported on a national basis only. The locations which the Deputy is seeking information on are contained in the Dublin Metropolitan Region West statistics in the reports.</p><p>The latest published report is for the year 2011 and I understand that the 2012 report is currently at draft stage.</p><p>My Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service funds 100 Garda Youth Diversion projects (GYDPs) nationwide of which three cover areas mentioned by the Deputy.  These projects are community-based, multi-agency, crime prevention initiatives which are designed to engage with and seek to divert young people from becoming involved in or further involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour. They operate in tandem with and as a support to the statutory Garda Diversion Programme mentioned above. They aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project. The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of them remaining within the justice system.The funding to these three projects from my Department in the requested years is set out in the table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Project Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Coverage</th><th> 2009 Funding</th><th>2010 Funding</th><th> 2011 Funding</th><th>2012 Funding</th></tr><tr><td>GRAFT</td><td>Neilstown Rd, Clondalkin</td><td> North Clondalkin and Lucan</td><td>&euro;143,282</td><td>&euro;120,728</td><td>&euro;120,814</td><td>&euro;128,814</td></tr><tr><td>SWIFT</td><td>Bawnogue Youth and Community Centre, Clondalkin</td><td>Clondalkin</td><td> &euro;118,947</td><td> &euro;118,112</td><td> &euro;114,131</td><td>&euro;114,131</td></tr><tr><td>Valley</td><td>Neilstown Village</td><td>Palmerstown, Lucan, North Clondalkin</td><td>&euro;113,230</td><td>&euro;108,746</td><td>&euro;105,234</td><td>&euro;105,234</td></tr></table></p><p>Finally, I wish to add that the Diversion Programme has been shown to be successful in diverting young offenders away from crime by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families. Tackling youth crime continues to be a key priority for this Government as set out in the Programme for Government and I am committed to continuing the Programme as is reflected in the resources available to the Garda Commissioner and the 2013 budget for the GYDPs which remains similar to the budget of 2012.</p></reply>

However, I am aware that, for the purposes of developing appropriate policy responses, there is a need for data of both a quantitative and qualitative nature on the extent of gambling in Ireland and its impacts.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department is currently preparing legislative proposals on gambling. The new legislation will be comprehensive and extensive. I hope to obtain the Government's approval soon for the drafting of a Bill based on a General Scheme I  have submitted. The new legislation will have consumer protection generally as its main aim, and will include several measures aimed at assisting and protecting vulnerable persons, the young and those for whom gambling has become a problem. </p><p>  I will be expecting the gambling industry to embrace this central aim and to work with the authorities and on their own initiative to promote responsible gambling.  My proposals will facilitate the industry's involvement by providing for a Fund to aid research, education and awareness activities and to support treatment programmes. The Fund will be based on contributions from the industry but my proposals will ensure independent supervision of its disbursement.  </p><p>  In light of its purposes, I would expect that, in time, the Fund will  be used to undertake studies of the kind referred to by the Deputy. However, pending the establishment of that statutory fund, my Department is actively considering how the data I mentioned earlier can be collected so that work on the development of suitable policies can get under way in advance of the new legislation coming into operation. </p></reply>

All inter-country adoptions must be carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation  in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption 1993. Ghana is not a signatory to this Convention nor is there any administrative arrangement between the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Ghanaian authorities.</p><p>  A visa will only be granted in respect of a child adopted in another State where that adoption will be legally recognised in this State. That was not the case in relation to this application. Therefore, there was no possibility of this application succeeding. The person in question was contacted by an official in my Department and advised of this fact and invited to withdraw the application, which she subsequently did, thus preventing the creation of a visa refusal record which could have negatively impacted on any future visa applications made or sponsored by her.</p><p>  At all times, the protection of children is paramount to INIS.

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. </p><p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  ISIS is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much welcomed the recent initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information via the website.   The Deputy may be aware that the ISIS committee are providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues and a number of seminars have also been held.  </p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I have established a Penal Policy Review Group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy including prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, accommodation and regimes, support for reintegration and rehabilitation and the issue of female prisoners.  I expect the Group to report later this year and I intend to publish that report.  It would not be in keeping with the principles of judicial independence for the Executive to impose a Sentencing Council on the Judiciary and it will be noted that is not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published last week. The report covers a number of complex issues and the recommendations contained in the report will be fully considered in my Department together with the report of the Penal Policy Review Group when it has been finalised.</p></reply>

The term State Boards is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &#8220;Board&#8221;.  In the cases where expressions of interest were sought, details of the appointments are provided below.</p><p><b><i>Censorship of Publications Board</i></b></p><p>  There are currently five vacancies on the Censorship of Publications Board.  Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 36 applications were received.

Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 33 applications were received.  Again I expect to fill these positions shortly. </p><p><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management</i></b></p><p> One appointment was made to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management.  The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act, 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.</p><p><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>  There are currently nine vacancies on the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 44 applications were received.  I expect to make appointments to these positions in the near future. </p><p><b><i>Courts Service Board</i></b></p><p>  The Courts Service Board has 17 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice. There have been 15 appointments, three of which were individuals nominated by myself including a civil servant from my Department.  There are no vacancies at present.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board</i></b></p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government and consists of a Chairperson, a member nominated by the representatives associations and a member nominated by the Government.  The Chairperson is appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in agreement with the representative associations.  Four appointments were made to the board.  There are no current vacancies.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board</i></b></p><p>  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only has a few outstanding cases on hands.  The 9th appointee is a civil servant.</p><p><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board</i></b></p><p>  Six appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The Board consists of 10 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Three of the appointments were individuals nominated by myself. There are no current vacancies.</p><p><b><i>Legal Aid Board</i></b></p><p>  Fourteen vacancies occurred.  Of the 14 appointments to this Board, eight were civil or public servants.  There are no current vacancies.</p><p><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board</i></b></p><p>  Four appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.  There are currently no vacancies.</p><p><b><i>National Disability Authority (NDA)</i></b></p><p>  One appointment was made to the board of the National Disability Authority (NDA).   I made the appointment after seeking expressions of interest of which I received 12 applications.  This appointment was from a public applicant.  There are currently no vacancies on the board of the NDA.</p><p><b><i>Parole Board</i></b></p><p>  There were ten appointments made to the Parole Board.  There are currently no vacancies.</p><p><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>  Four vacancies occurred.  The Government appointed four people on 3 April, 2012.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. There are no current vacancies. </p><p><b><i>Private Security Authority (PSA)</i></b></p><p>  Eleven vacancies occurred.  Out of these seven positions were advertised as the remaining four positions, in accordance with the relevant legislation, are to be nominated representatives from my own Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSA itself.  Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 29 applications were received.  While I have not yet announced details of the Board, I can advise that I expect to fill the seven positions from those 29 applications received.</p><p><b><i>Property Registration Authority</i></b></p><p>  Three appointments were made to the Property Registration Authority, of which, in accordance with the legislation, one is a nominee of the Law Society, one is a nominee of the Bar Council and the 3rd the elected Property Registration Authority staff representative.  There are no current vacancies.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>  The Government made six appointments after seeking expressions of interest of which my Department received 41 applications.  Those appointed were public applicants.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.   There are no current vacancies.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Regulatory Authority</i></b></p><p>  Eleven appointments were made to the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA).  I received 114 applications after seeking expressions of interest from members of the public.  Nine of those appointed were public applicants, one is a civil servant and the Chairperson, who was a member of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Implementation Team, was appointed in order to provide continuity to the Authority which had operated on a non-statutory basis for a number of years. The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  There are no current vacancies.</p><p><b><i>The Equality Authority</i></b></p><p>  The fourteen outgoing board members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012, and therefore the issues of selection did not arise.  The Deputy will be aware that the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority are in the process of merging to form a new enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Authority Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.   The  Working Group that I established to advise me on the practical issues in relation to the establishment of a new Commission in its Report of April 2012 recommended that an independent Selection Panel be set up for the purpose of appointing the new members.  This is in line with a fundamental requirement of the Paris Principles that the members of the IHREC be independent and that the selection process be independent of Government.  </p><p>  In November 2012 advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; member appeared in the media. The independent panel forwarded its recommendations of 14 names in March 2013. While the persons recommended cannot be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the  Government has appointed the 14 individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they will be appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation is enacted, on a 3 year or 5 year basis to ensure that the term of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.    On 31 May 2013, I appointed 12 of their number to the board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of 3 years, but which will otherwise expire when the Bill to establish the IHREC is enacted and commenced and the two bodies are dissolved.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and is scheduled to commence Committee Stage next month. The Bill does not make any provision in relation to the role or status of &quot;legal executives&quot; nor is any such provision envisaged. It is clear from the correspondence I have received from the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd that the scope of their proposals to confer legal status and a whole range of functions on such a category of persons is extensive and goes beyond those measures to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill. </p><p>It is evident that the proposals being made by the Irish Institute of Legal Executives Ltd, on behalf of its members, are far-reaching from the fact that they relate <i>inter alia</i>  to &quot;a right of audience in the District and Circuit Courts, before tribunals and, subject to review, subsequently in all courts&quot;, and to the eligibility of members for quasi-judicial and judicial appointments (e.g as District Court judges or members of Tribunals). These proposals also draw heavily from the  regulatory and practise models of England and Wales which do not always correspond to those of our jurisdiction nor to those set out under current Government policy in the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. </p><p>  While recognising that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for &quot;legal executives&quot;, the far-reaching proposals being made on their behalf at this time lie beyond the scope of the Legal Services Regulation Bill impinging, as they do, on aspects of the courts and the judiciary. Such matters will, therefore, need to be considered separately on their own merits, while others may come to be considered in due course by the new  Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  <b><font color="#000080">    </font></b></p></reply>

I hope to secure the Government's approval for my proposals in the near future.</p><p>  Under current law, regulation is, in general, sector specific, with a number of State agencies performing functions in relation to the sector in question. My Department's Scheme will replace those current systems with the result that, for the first time, all regulatory, licensing and enforcement functions will come under a single agency, namely  the Minister for Justice and Equality. I would expect that the reorganisation of responsibilities now being proposed should overcome problems that may have in the past made it more difficult to undertake initiatives to, for example, measure on a national basis the scale and impact of gambling across different sectors. </p><p>  The Scheme will also provide for the creation of a statutory Fund. The Fund will be based on contributions by the industry. Its purpose is to support research, education and awareness as well as treatment programmes for persons who have acquired a harmful gambling habit or addiction. The Fund will be managed independently. </p><p>  I can tell the Deputy that, pending the enactment and coming into operation of the new legislation, my Department is actively looking at ways to collect data that is current and reliable and that can be used for the developments of policies to address gambling difficulties. </p><p>  My Department does not have access to information that would support, or otherwise, suggestions of an increase in the  numbers of persons presenting with addiction problems. I am not, therefore, in a position to comment on the matter other than to say that information on not only numbers, but other factors such as age and gender could assist in targeting our policies. The scarcity of information on this and on other impacts of gambling underlines the need for measures such as the Fund I referred to above. </p></reply>

It provides for a range of  offences which cover behaviours such as disorderly conduct, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour, wilful obstruction, trespass and entry with intent to commit an offence as well as categories of violent behaviour. The Act also provides for offences for failure to comply with Garda directions. </p><p>  In addition, the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provide Garda&iacute; with powers to address public order problems and anti-social behaviour related to the misuse of alcohol. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides Garda&iacute; with powers to deal with anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking, including exclusion orders in respect of premises and closure orders for licensed premises and catering outlets following anti-social behaviour related offences. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to Garda&iacute; to tackle the misuse of alcohol, including the power to seize alcohol in the possession of an under 18 year old which they suspect is for consumption in a public place.  Garda&iacute; may can also seize alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property. Fixed charge notices may be issued for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place. This option has the benefit of a more efficient use of Garda and Court resources, while also allowing an offender who complies with the notice to avoid a possible criminal record. </p><p>  Where anti-social behaviour is directed at property, the Garda&iacute; may have recourse to the provisions of the Criminal Damage Act 1991 which provides a range of offences and penalties, up to and including, on conviction on indictment, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years for the damage, threat of damage or possession of anything with intent to damage, a person&rsquo;s property. </p><p>  Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act relates to anti-social behaviour by children.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.</p><p>  I am advised that there are some issues which come within the remit of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government which could be relevant to the matters referred to in the Deputy's question.  In the case of private rented dwellings landlords are responsible for enforcing the obligations that apply to their tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. In this regard the Act prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies it also allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour, subject to a notice period of only 7 days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour. </p><p>  The Residential Tenancies Act also provides that a third party directly and adversely affected by anti-social behaviour may, subject to certain conditions, refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations. A specific condition is that the third party complainant must have taken reasonable steps to resolve the matter by communicating or attempting to communicate with the parties to the tenancy concerned.</p><p>  In relation to avenues of civil redress generally, it is, of course, always open to a person to seek independent legal advice in relation to the forms of redress, including civil remedies,  which might be relevant to particular situations.</p></reply>

In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that discussions are ongoing with the Office of Public Works and the National Development Finance Agency in order to progress the projects. The projects are to be procured and delivered through a Public Private Partnership.</p><p>  I am informed that the Office of Public Works is currently working on a design for the Waterford project. The development will include 6 courtrooms, replacing the current 2 courtrooms, and improved facilities for all court users, including jurors, persons in custody, and victim support. Consultation facilities will also be improved. There will be discussions with court users on the proposed design in the coming weeks.</p><p>  I am informed that the delivery of a project of this scale as a traditional capital project would be likely to cost in excess of &euro;20m. However, as the project is to be delivered on a Public Private Partnership basis, the total cost will include not only the cost of construction but also the costs of maintenance and other services to be provided by the PPP company. This will be paid by way of charges over a period of 25 years.</p><p>  It is intended that this project will go through the Part 9 Planning process later this year with the PPP procurement process commencing around the end of the year.

As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members including those being raised by the Deputy on this occasion.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee and work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis while also taking account of any intervening matters of relevance such as decisions by the Courts.  It remains my objective under this new approach, and subject to having to deal with the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring a revised Bill to Government for approval and publication before the end of the year.</p></reply>

In addition to the introduction of the Directive, it is my intention to bring forward, by the end of the year, a broadly-based Mediation Bill to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes. The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings. It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.<b></b></p><p>  I should add that since 2010 Ireland has had a modern Arbitration Act - the Arbitration Act 2010 - which applies the Model Law on Arbitration to all arbitrations which take place within the State.    The legislation incorporates key principles which are important to commercial arbitrations such as party autonomy and a court intervention system which is supportive of arbitration but which aims at minimal interference in the overall process.</p><p>  In addition, the Deputy should note that, the following non-judicial alternatives for resolving disputes and settling issues are available within the court system:</p><p><b>Superior Courts</b></p><p>  New rules to promote mediation and conciliation in proceedings in the Superior Courts have been in force since 2010.  These rules provide for a mechanism similar to the type used extensively in the Commercial Court whereby a judge can order the parties to engage in an alternative dispute resolution process. The provisions specify that the refusal or failure without good reason of a party to participate in mediation or conciliation may be taken into account by the court when awarding costs. The aim of this measure is to minimise the cost of the proceedings and to ensure that the time and other resources of the court are employed optimally.</p><p><b>Family Law</b></p><p>  A unique tripartite initiative involving the Courts Service, Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service commenced in March 2011 in the Family Law Court in Dolphin House District Court. The project's objective is to offer a more appropriate means of resolving certain family disputes through, in the first instance, offering mediation information to persons who have made contact with the Courts Service with a view to issuing proceedings in relation to access, custody or guardianship matters. </p><p>  The Circuit Court in Dublin is facilitating mediation information sessions free of charge to parties in family law cases. This is provided by mediators from the Mediators Institute of Ireland, Friary Hall and the Family Mediation Service. </p><p><b>Civil Law</b></p><p>  Callers to the Dublin Circuit and District Civil Court Office are encouraged to use the mediation process when seeking certain court remedies. The County Registrar may also refer cases from her court which she deems suitable for mediation. The initiative, supported by the Courts Service, involves three mediation services - South Dublin Mediation Service, Ballymun Mediation and Mediation Northside and is supported by the Mediators' Institute of Ireland (MII).  Disputes considered appropriate for mediation include boundary disputes, private prosecutions for breach of the peace, complaints about noise or nuisance and disputes between adult family members on questions of property. </p></reply>

Under Section 2 of the Act, Ministerial authorisation may be given for interceptions solely in the interests of the security of the State or for the purpose of criminal investigation. </p><p>  The 2011 Communications (Retention of Data) Act  provides for access to traffic data, location data and subscriber data.

The content of calls, texts etc are not disclosed under this Act.</p><p>  Both statutory schemes are subject to judicial oversight. Both the 1993 and 2011 Acts provide for the appointment of a High Court Judge to carry out reviews of their operation and the relevant reports to An Taoiseach are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the Acts provide for a procedure whereby a member of the public who believes their communications have been intercepted or that their personal data has been accessed (whichever the case may be) may make a complaint to a &quot;Complaints Referee&quot;.

The information requested in respect of 2012 in relation to those Agencies is set out in the Table below.

In the context of the current strength being below the agreed stabilised strength, it is my intention that targeted recruitment will take place, within the resource envelope allocated to Defence, from the existing 2012 General Service Recruitment panels in the Autumn.</p><p>  The intention is to call persons as per their numerical order on current panels.  However, due to the passage of time since the last intake of recruits some stages in the recruitment process such as medical examination, physical fitness testing and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Security Clearance which are time dependant will have to be completed again.</p><p>  No decisions have yet been made with regard to recruitment in 2014.</p></reply>

The Civil Defence Board was established in 2003. I appointed an interim Board as a temporary measure from 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised. The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished and legislation was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012 for the dissolution of the Board.

The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p><p>The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011, and I have since appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff. As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps,   this position was not publicly advertised. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 13 January 2012.</p><p>The current non military ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board, a civilian doctor, will retire at the end of June 2013.  Expressions of interest in the position of civilian doctor to the Army Pensions Board have been invited by way of advertisement on the Department&rsquo;s website and the Public Appointments Service website.  Closing date for receipt of applications was 10 June 2013.</p><p>In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure.

Participation in ongoing overseas operations also necessitates multi lateral-training and assessment. This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces training methods and standards within an international military context.  I am advised that Defence Forces personnel continue to have the most modern and effective range of equipment and technology available for their training and day-to-day roles.</p><p>  I am satisfied that Naval Service training techniques and technologies are up to date in all respects,  with the most up to date equipment, including modern technology and IT equipment available to Naval Service personnel. Preparations for the construction of two new offshore Patrol Vessels are advancing with the first ship due for delivery in early 2014. These modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure the Naval Service continues to meet the required operational capability.   A considerable training effort is also involved with the new ships programme to allow for a smooth entry of the first ship into operational service in 2014 and the second ship in 2015.</p><p>  The Air Corps keeps abreast of all developments in modern aviation.  It will continue to conduct its training in accordance with industry best practices and to the highest standards, referencing European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements, using the most modern methods and equipment available.</p><p>  The budgetary situation, in the context of the current difficult economic situation, will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment, training and upgrades.  Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The following table (Annex B) outlines the number serving, by rank, as advised by the Military Authorities for 30 April 2013, the latest date for which figures are available.  In relation to the figures provided I would like to point out to the Deputy that the Military Authorities have implemented a revised policy of reporting strength figures from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2013. With effect from this date the strength figures for the Permanent Defence Force are being calculated on the basis of actual numbers serving on the date i.e. excluding those on career breaks or leave of absence for periods exceeding eight weeks. This change in how strengths are calculated brings the strength returns for the Permanent Defence Force in line with the remainder of the Public Service.  </p><p>  Competitions to establish panels to fill outstanding vacancies were held last year. Promotions from the panels are currently ongoing within the Permanent Defence Force in order to fill rank vacancies.

On 12-13 February 2013, I hosted an informal meeting of EU Ministers of Defence in Dublin Castle.  The Operational Commanders of three of the four current EU-led missions were also in attendance. Discussions were focused on these current operations and future proposed developments.  Ireland contributes Defence Forces personnel to three of the four current EU military missions.  Ireland contributes seven personnel to the Operation ALTHEA mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Ireland also contributes ten Defence Forces personnel, including Mission Commander Brigadier General Gerald Aherne, to EUTM Somalia, the EU&rsquo;s mission to train Somali security forces in Uganda.  Ireland has also contributed eight Defence Forces personnel to the EUTM Mali mission as part of a joint contingent with the UK.</p><p>  The other EU military mission, Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA, is the EU&rsquo;s first maritime operation which contributes to improving maritime security off the coast of Somalia and in the Indian Ocean.  Ireland does not currently contribute personnel to this operation.  </p><p>  As well as these four military operations, the EU has recently launched three new civilian Common Security and Defence Policy missions. These include EUCAP Nestor, a Regional Maritime Capacity Building mission to enhance the capacity of Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa region to fight piracy.  This mission is complementary to and has close coordination with Operation EUNAVFOR ATALANTA and EUTM Somalia and international actors.  This civilian mission is augmented with military expertise.  </p><p>  Regarding UN missions, Ireland currently contributes 361 personnel to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) Mission.  Following the deployment of a contingent of some 170 personnel of the Armed forces of Finland to UNIFIL, a joint Irish-Finnish Battalion was formed in May 2012.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with several United Nations missions.  Overall there are currently 445 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas. </p><p>  In response to a request from the United Nations to deploy personnel to the headquarters of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria, three personnel are expected to deploy to the mission shortly.  A fourth member of the Permanent Defence Force will deploy to the mission in the coming weeks.</p><p>  In April 2013 a request was received from the United Nations to deploy additional Military Observers to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East to the Headquarters of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria.  This request is currently receiving consideration and a decision is expected shortly.</p><p>  We have also received a request from the UN to deploy a specialist training team on Conventional Munitions Disposal (CMD), mine and specialist search awareness to South Sudan to support the work of the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS).  I will shortly be bringing proposals to Government to seek approval for the deployment of a training team of four (4) personnel to South Sudan.</p><p>  As regards future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered. </p><p>  Within the EU itself, a number of committees, including the Political and Security Committee and the EU Military Committee, keep the issues of troop deployments, including rapid response, under constant review in consultation with all EU Member States.</p></reply>

The Department has been engaged on an ongoing programme of barrack consolidation since 1998. This programme has brought to fourteen the number of barracks closed during that time.  In addition to the main barracks a number of other smaller properties have also been identified as surplus to military requirements. Some of these have already been disposed of whilst others are in the process of being prepared for disposal. These mainly consist of married quarters and Reserve Defence Force premises. Earlier this year as part of the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force a number of additional properties became surplus to requirements and these will also be disposed of.</p><p>  The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years.

Rates of reimbursement, fixed in accordance with UN categories of equipment and personnel, are agreed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ireland and the UN for each mission. The only mission for which Ireland is currently entitled to reimbursement of some troop and equipment costs, is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).    Since 1 January 2012, the total amount received from the United Nations in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Forces personnel in UNIFIL is calculated at &euro;13.4m. The amount currently owing to the Department of Defence by the United Nations is calculated at &euro;10.8 million approximately. This amount includes &euro;4.4 million in respect of the current UNIFIL mission which we would expect to receive in the coming weeks and &euro;6.4 million in respect of repatriation costs of equipment from the MINURCAT mission in Chad. The amount owing in relation to the MINURCAT mission is currently the subject of ongoing negotiations with the UN. Ireland is not entitled to any reimbursement in respect of Defence Forces participation in EU-led missions as all troop contributors to such missions are responsible for their own costs. </p></reply>

The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished and legislation was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012 for the dissolution of the Board.  Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence.</p><p>  In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013.</p><p>  The only body remaining under the aegis of my Department is the Army Pensions Board, which is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927. Its principal function under the Army Pensions Acts is to investigate applications for pensions, allowances and gratuities arising from the death or disablement of members of the Defence Forces in the course of their military service.  No new semi- State organisations have been established under the aegis of my Department since March 2011.</p></reply>

Operations in a total of four plants were suspended (in some cases on a voluntary basis) for varying periods arising from the investigation.  While the report concluded that none of the meat plants in Ireland knowingly purchased horsemeat information in relation to activities by traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain outside of the jurisdiction has been passed to Europol and other Member States to facilitate continuing investigations in other countries.</p><p>  It is important to note in that context that while some of the failures referred to in the report risked reputational damage to the Irish food sector, they did not breach EU or national law.  My Department is however considering the possibility of introducing legal proceedings in certain instances as referred to in the report.</p><p>  A range of actions taken in relation to this issue at both national and EU level include a programme of DNA testing of beef products and testing of horse meat for the presence of phenylbutazone.  Controls relating to horse identification are being strengthened and my Department has taken responsibility for the supervision of all horse abattoirs in Ireland.  Meat traders/agents will also be required to register as food business operators.</p><p>  On 16th April results were published of the EU wide testing programme for equine DNA in beef products and phenylbutazone (bute) in horse carcases.  The results showed that, across the EU, there were 4,144 tests under the equine DNA programme of which 193 were positive.  In Ireland, all of the results of the 50 DNA tests on Irish beef products under the EU programme were negative.</p><p>  In addition there were 7,951 tests reported for equine DNA carried out by food business operators across the EU, of which 110 were positive.  Under the Irish national DNA testing regime the results of 2185 DNA tests published by the FSAI to date showed only a small number of positives (32 representing 9 products), all of which were published previously and related to products withdrawn from the market.  DNA testing by food business operators is ongoing and results will be published periodically by the FSAI.</p><p>  In relation to the EU programme for bute testing there were 16 positives from 3,115 tests.  In Ireland of the 840 tests carried out on horse carcases for bute, only one was positive.  The carcase concerned was destroyed and the case is under investigation.</p><p>  The Irish authorities were the first to discover and disclose this problem of adulteration of beef products, which turned out to be a pan European problem.  Exposure of this malpractice will result in improved consumer protection not just in Ireland, but also throughout Europe. In that regard, the EU Commission is pursuing an action plan over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014 which includes specific actions and measures on the following basic elements: fighting food fraud, testing programmes, horse passports, official controls and origin labelling.  It is important that controls in this area are strengthened on a pan European basis, not just at national level, and as stated in the report some of the measures envisaged will require legislative change at EU level.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-18a.1198.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061800059#WRY01300"><p>From a mitigation point of view there are a number of particular challenges for the Irish agriculture sector: Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in the agriculture sector arise mainly due to natural processes which have developed over a long period of time.  To date, mitigation technologies that would significantly abate the impact of these processes, without impacting productivity, have not been identified on a large scale.  A high proportion of non-Emissions Trading System (non-ETS) emissions come from the agriculture sector.  Irish agriculture, with its temperate grassland production system, has already demonstrated a high level of carbon efficiency compared with other EU Member States and third countries, and this has been recognised by the EU's Joint Research Centre and Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations.  The level of efficiency already achieved in the Irish sector means that there is limited additional mitigation potential available using currently available technologies and practices.</p><p>  My Department continues to engage in extensive assessment of the mitigation potential in the agricultural sector, based on knowledge generated through its research programmes<font color="#FF0000">.</font>  Since 2005, the Department has made awards totalling more than &euro;20m on climate change related projects.  For example, last November some &euro;2.7M was allocated to projects that are examining aspects of sustainability in agriculture and climate action, including sustainable nitrogen use, ruminant production and life cycle analysis.  The results of the assessment to date indicate that there is mitigation potential of the order of 5% compared to Business as Usual.</p><p>  National and international research has provided some cost-effective mitigation options.  While none of these are groundbreaking, reductions in emissions can be achieved, particularly when a number of measures are employed in combination.  The emphasis must be on improving carbon efficiency and intensity with an even greater number farmers availing of the latest available knowledge and best practices current output levels.</p><p>  My Department continues to stress the need to combine climate change mitigation ambition with a competitive and carbon efficient farming system.  The key underlying themes to the industry's Food Harvest 2020 strategy are &#8220;Smart, Green, Growth&#8221;.  All actors in the Irish agri-food industry understand the importance of sustainability in increased production.  In June 2012 Bord Bia launched Origin Green, a national voluntary sustainability development programme that is designed to help Ireland become a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink.  Interested companies sign up to a Sustainability Charter where they set out clear targets in key areas such as raw material sourcing, emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and social sustainability.</p><p>  At the food manufacturing level it is intended that 75% of Irish food and drink exports will be sourced from companies participating in Origin Green before the end of 2014.  With some 254 Irish food and drink companies already registered to participate in the programme, this represents more than 70% of Ireland's food and drink exporters.  At farm level, since 2011, over 43,000 members of Bord Bia's Beef Quality Assurance Scheme members have participated in a sustainability survey, developed by Bord Bia in conjunction with Teagasc, as part of their regular farm audit. Ireland is the first country in the world to assess the footprint performance of farms on a national scale.  The audit results combined with the development of the Teagasc/Bord Bia Carbon Navigator Tool enables farmers to set targets in areas that can improve the environmental and financial performance of their farm in addition to providing a unique selling point for Irish beef in key export markets.</p><p>  Similar programmes are planned across the entire range of primary agricultural production - for the dairy industry; for poultry production at both farm and processing level; for pigmeat and lamb production with a view to completing this work by the end of 2013; and projects are also being planned for grain and horticulture.  My Department continues to play a central role in the development of schemes to incentivize participation by farmers in discussion groups that are designed to promote best practices in farming.  The Department has developed and provides the funding for the Dairy Efficiency Programme and the Beef and Sheep Technology Action Programmes.  Teagasc and other private advisors in turn provide the advisory service on the ground to farmers.  The Department will continue to seek to maximise the opportunities under CAP to mobilise an effective advisory service that takes account of environmental issues.</p></reply>

Every two years the FAO organises a conference to agree its multi-year Programme of work, strategy, and budget.  This conference also organises seats on the FAO Council (of which Ireland is currently a member) and provides updates on many aspects of its work.  My colleague, Minister of State Tom Hayes TD, will attend this important event, along with other EU and global ministers, and will address the Conference as President of the Council of EU Member States.</p><p>  My officials have been active in preparing for this conference for several months now, co-ordinating the EU&rsquo;s position and seeking agreement with other countries. Ireland, together with the EU is seeking to ensure that the FAO continues its valuable work and its major re-organization while improving its efficiency and re-focussing its strategy.  We will also ensure that gender remains a key cross-cutting measure in all FAO work.  The theme of this year&rsquo;s report on the State of Food and Agriculture is &ldquo;Sustainable food systems for Food Security and Nutrition.&rdquo;  Ireland and its fellow Member States will support the FAO in continuing to ensure that food security remains at the heart of FAO work and that the role of nutrition in world health is given the prominence that it deserves.</p></reply>

In terms of available quota, the whitefish quotas for 2013 were down 1% from the 2012 quotas.  However, the 2012 quotas represented a 3 % increase on the 2011 quotas.  Accordingly, whitefish quota levels have remained relatively stable over the recent past with some 36,538 tonnes of whitefish available to the Irish fishing fleet.</p><p>  Supplies of cod, in particular, to the EU market have increased significantly in 2013 reflecting the high quotas of cod in the Arctic Ocean and the increased availability has placed downward pressure on whitefish species generally.  Prices have also been impacted by the situation of the EU economy and especially in Spain where the market for high end fish species, such as hake and monk, is reduced.</p><p>  Bord Bia and BIM are available to support Irish fishermen to identify and pursue market opportunities.  Bord Bia supports Irish seafood exporters who are continually working to diversify and broaden export opportunities and also to promote fish in the domestic market.  BIM is supporting the industry during 2013 with a &euro;5 million investment package involving &euro;1.6 million in grant-aid for Ireland&rsquo;s fisheries sector.  This package covers a range of 150 environmental and conservation initiatives, quality schemes as well as local employment and coastal community support programmes.</p></reply>

Due to the particular time pressures during the specific period of the EU Presidency, it was simply not possible to schedule as many meetings with industry representatives as I would have liked.  I met the Federation of Irish Fishermen twice in Dublin during that extremely busy period and I also met them when they travelled to the Council meetings.  Indeed, I had a lengthy and very useful meeting with the FIF during the critical May Fisheries Council when the final Council mandate was being negotiated.  I was fully aware at all times of the position of Irish fishermen from consultations and submissions over the course of the entire reform period.  I very much appreciated and valued their input.</p><p>  It is important to both understand and accept that Ireland&rsquo;s fisheries are managed collaboratively at EU level through the Common Fisheries Policy.  Our EU colleagues will acknowledge, I believe, that Ireland is prepared to drive a hard bargain in every area of fisheries policy determined at EU level and I believe our record over the past two years has been one of steady progress across a range of issues.  While I always strenuously argue Ireland&rsquo;s case on all issues related to fisheries, it is not always possible for any individual Member State, whether large or small, to achieve absolutely everything wished for in terms of outcomes.</p><p>  An impartial assessment of the new CFP reforms will, I believe, show that many of the proposals from the Irish industry, have been delivered either in full or in part in the final agreement.  I believe that these reforms once implemented and embedded will in due course provide the basis for a significant period of growth in both our own domestic Irish fishing industry and in EU fisheries generally.</p><p>  I have recently been in touch with all recognised industry representatives to advise them of the detail of the reforms and of my intention to convene a meeting in the coming weeks to consult them directly on the implementation of the reform including on the &lsquo;discards ban/ obligation to land&rsquo; aspects.</p></reply>

However, as tractor design has moved on considerably since that Directive was introduced in 1986, the location imposed by it is not compatible with several newer tractor models.  The amending Directive 2012/24/EU updates the old specifications and makes provision for front PTO&rsquo;s as laid down in ISO 8759-1:1998 (with the exception of clause 4.2).

However the definition of an active farmer is still the subject of substantial discussion in the CAP reform negotiations and there is no clear outcome as yet.  The current final stage of the negotiations involves reaching agreement between the three Institutions.  At this point it is too early to speculate on the final definition that may emerge.</p></reply>

Its breeding programme originally focused on the breeding of varieties for the home market but since the inception of its partnership with Irish Potato Marketing, (IPM) in the 1970&rsquo;s, the scope of the breeding programme expanded very successfully to include breeding for the export market as well as to producing a suitable processing variety for the home market. Since its partnership with IPM, Teagasc has released 39 varieties and at least 25 of these are still being marketed commercially by IPM in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.  </p><p>  The first big success was the variety Cara, bred in the early 1970&rsquo;s. Cara became the main seed export variety from Ireland following its release and is still a popular variety in the U.K., North Africa and the Mediterranean regions. The variety Rooster, released in 1990 as a variety suitable for the Irish home market, is probably the best-known of the Teagasc-bred varieties and  accounts for 56% of the total potato area grown in Ireland. Less well known varieties such as Setanta and Infinity, released in 2004 and 2009 respectively, are showing promise in the potato crisping industry.  </p><p>  The Teagasc Breeding Programme usually submit 3 to 4 new seedlings each year to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Crop Evaluation and Certification Programme, to evaluate yield and agronomic characters and to ensure the uniformity and stability of the potentially new varieties. A successful outcome from these examinations is a legal prerequisite before commercial marketing of new varieties can commence. Fourteen new varieties were released from the Teagasc Breeding Programme over the last 10 years.</p></reply>

Given the restrictions faced by those farming in recognised Disadvantaged Areas and mindful of the aims of the Scheme, as outlined, it will be readily appreciated that appropriate stocking levels are crucial.  In this regard, balance must be struck between the need to ensure that at least the minimum is done to ensure the land is adequately utilised and grazed, while at the same time being sufficiently aware of the natural constraints.  In this regard the minimum stocking levels currently set under the Scheme, which are not unduly onerous, achieve this twin objective.  </p><p>  Bearing in mind the efforts of my Department to help farmers maintain stocking levels in response to weather difficulties, I believe that the terms of the 2013 Scheme, as previously announced, remain appropriate.  However, farmers with genuine fodder-related stocking difficulties may avail of the force majeure provisions of the Scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-18a.1265.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013061800059#WRZ01900"><p>I would consider that the output of organic nitrogen per hectare, NPH, on livestock farms is a good indication of stocking density on those farms.  In response to a previous question from the Deputy, I provided data on NPH based on payment per hectare categories as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Payment per hectare category</th><th>Number of farms</th><th>Average NPH per Category</th></tr><tr><td>&amp;lt; 250 Euro</td><td>49,804</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 250 &amp;lt;= 350</td><td>27,903</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 350 &amp;lt;= 450</td><td>15,964</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 450 &amp;lt;= 500</td><td>3,777</td><td>109</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 500</td><td>6,880</td><td>112</td></tr></table></p><p>Note that the payment per hectare categories are based on the 2010 SPS payment database, which my Department has used to model various CAP reform proposals.  The nitrogen per hectare (NPH) figures are calculated for the purpose of enforcing the Nitrates Directive, based on data from the AIM and SPS systems.  Please note also that these NPH figures (from livestock manure) are calculated using the claimed/reference area for the whole farm (whichever is the lesser), including arable lands. Additionally, NPH is also influenced by the type of stock held on the farm.  Farms which are exclusively arable are excluded from this data.</p><p>Based on the same payment per hectare categories, the 2010 modelling database shows the following stocking densities expressed as livestock units per hectare.  It should be borne in mind that these are the average values per payment category, and there would be a considerable range of stocking densities within each category.</p><p><table><tr><th>Payment per hectare category</th><th>Stocking density<br />(Livestock units per hectare)</th></tr><tr><td>less than &euro;250</td><td>0.80</td></tr><tr><td>250-350</td><td>1.52</td></tr><tr><td>350-450</td><td>1.75</td></tr><tr><td>450-500</td><td>1.81</td></tr><tr><td>over &euro;500</td><td>1.82</td></tr></table></p><p>While stocking density does not represent all the elements of agricultural productivity, it is a tangible measurement of activity where data from my Department is readily available.</p><p>This data shows that, using average results per payment category, farmers on higher payment per hectare rates have roughly double the stocking density of those below the average.  However, it does also show that the stocking density of farms on the very highest payment rates (e.g. over &euro;500 per hectare) is not significantly higher than the stocking density of farms just above the national average (e.g. &euro;300 to &euro;400 per hectare).</p></reply>

This radical reform will support the rebuilding of  fish stocks in our waters as Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas are set to deliver maximum sustainable yield by 2015, where possible and by 2020 for all stocks and the wasteful practice of discarding fish is phased out.

It will empower fishermen by giving them a key role in the decision making for their fisheries.</p><p>- This reform places long term sustainability at the core of fisheries policy with annual fishing quotas  based, in future,  on sound scientific advice.  Rebuilding of fish stocks so that fishing levels are based on Maximum Sustainable Yield; leading to potentially higher quotas for fishermen over time. </p><p>- Practical and phased discards policy where in early years of implementation, TACs and  quotas will be set to take account of current levels of discards- this should see quotas for Irish fishermen increase in the short term;  </p><p>- Technical measures to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish; </p><p>- It also involves a strong commitment  to protect juvenile fish and spawning grounds and to develop and strengthen biologically sensitive areas; it commits to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in biologically sensitive areas which includes the BSA off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box).</p><p>- The Hague Preferences are maintained and given increased reference.  These are critically important for Ireland and each December have given us an increased share of traditional whitefish stocks such as cod, haddock and whiting in the waters off our coast when stock levels are decreasing. </p><p>  I strongly believe that these reforms once implemented and embedded will provide the basis for a significant period of growth in both our own domestic Irish fishing industry and in European fisheries generally. </p></reply>

The eligibility criteria under which trainees and students qualify for the programme is determined by F&Aacute;S and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs).  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.</p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based child care services to enable them to provide child care at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low or relatively modest incomes. For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and qualifying income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.   Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including child care costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with middle incomes may also benefit from subvention.</p><p>  The ECCE programme provides one free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.   Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free preschool provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age child care initiative.  This After-school Childcare Programme, which represents a full year investment of &euro;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, by ensuring that some 6,000 quality after-school care places are provided to support children's development.  </p><p>  Eligibility for this programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.  The first pilot phase has commenced with up to 500 child care places available, with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.   </p><p>  These programmes have been maintained and expanded despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of child care.  </p><p>  Fingal County Childcare Committee (tel. 01 8077660) will advise parents in relation to their eligibility under these programmes.</p></reply>

The programme is being introduced on foot of the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty, drawing on best international practice and existing services to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people.  The programme will build on and continue much of the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which was also implemented by my Department.  </p><p>  The three existing PEIP sites and at least three additional sites are expected to participate in the new programme.  In addition, it is my intention to broaden the impact of the programme by beginning the process of mainstreaming some of the evidence-based programmes which have been positively evaluated and are cost-effective.  The establishment of my Department's new Child and Family Agency later this year will be important to this process.  </p><p>  Applications to participate in the programme were invited from interested not for profit consortia earlier this year.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 31st May and fifty applications were received, including the one referred to by the Deputy.  These are currently being reviewed by officials in my Department assisted by members of the cross-Departmental Project Team which is overseeing the process.  When completed, I hope to be in a position to announce successful applicants later this year.</p></reply>

These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.</p><p>  My Department has been actively working with the Department of Health, specifically the Office of Disability and Mental Health, in the context of building better supports to facilitate the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream pre-school settings.</p><p>  I was successful in securing capital funding in Budget 2013 to support the ongoing improvement of the childcare sector.

The approach I am taking in developing  the Strategy has received Government approval.  My intention is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.  </p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.  At present pre-school services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  </p><p>  A broad range of issues relating to regulations, standards, quality assurance, and inspection are currently being considered by the Expert Advisory Group which is advising my Department on the Strategy. As Minister I am committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum. The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and I am determined that this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Draft Heads and General Scheme for the Children First Bill 2012 on 25 April 2012 and immediately referred the Heads of Bill to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for consideration and advice.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published their report in July 2012.</p><p>  As part of the Joint Committees consultation process a number of submissions were received.  Overall there was a welcome that the legislation would increase the focus on child protection.  The contributions in the main came from organisations already implementing Children First.</p><p>  Submissions were not all in agreement and many points emerging needed to be considered and reconciled.  This involves consideration of policy and operational issues, including those pertaining to childminders, as well as the best legal approach to achieving Children First objectives. In this regard, officials within my Department have consulted with a number of organisations and individuals and I recently met with a number of key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues that have arisen. I have also taken the opportunity to consult with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area. These discussions will inform the preparation of enhanced policy proposals that is currently underway.</p><p>  The obligations of mandatory reporting are onerous and the inclusion of specific professionals and post holders is being considered very carefully at this time including persons working in the child care sector generally.</p><p>  I should emphasise that under the existing Children First National Guidelines there is very clear advice available to all employees, volunteers and parents on how to raise any concerns they have about a child's safety and welfare.</p><p>  It is my intention to submit further proposals to Government as soon as possible with a view to the drafting of the Children First Bill as a priority.</p></reply>

HIQA undertakes inspection of foster care services against the National Standards for Foster Care, under Section 69 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The purpose of foster care inspections is to review compliance with regulations and standards for all children.  HIQA's inspection methodology includes interviewing HSE managers and social workers, a sample of children, carers and birth parents and review a range of files, including complaints.</p><p>  This announced inspection was carried out on dates between the 15<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup>  October 2012.  This is the first inspection of this particular service and the findings highlighted areas of good practice as well as areas where improvements are required.   </p><p>  Arising from the recommendations contained in this report, the HSE has drawn up an Action Plan for implementation by end of 2013.</p><p><b>Social Work numbers</b></p><p>  Figures supplied by the HSE, from its April 2013 census of employment in the public health and social care sector, indicate that the number of whole-time equivalent Social Workers is 1,399. </p><p>  According to the HSE there are 36 professionally qualified social workers vacancies currently being filled and a further 114 social work posts including social work team leaders, principals etc are being processed.</p><p><b>Future Plans</b></p><p>  The Government has approved the Heads of the Child and Family Agency Bill and has also agreed to the priority drafting of this Bill. The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as soon as possible.

The minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. </p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, the inspection of pre-schools is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>  It is important to realise that inspections alone are not the answer to improving quality. What is required is a multi-faceted approach, and since this Government came to office we have been working to ensure issues relating to child protection and welfare are put front and centre. The establishment of a Department of Children and Youth Affairs was recognition of the huge body of work which needs to be done in this area.</p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing pre-school inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.</p><p>  In support of this, a Joint Pilot Inspection of Early Years Services was carried out by Inspectors from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills between September 2011 and May 2012.  This pilot will inform the proactive approach being taken.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Pre-School Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce.  </p><p>  This commitment has always been a key priority for me.  This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive Pre-School Quality Agenda. </p><p>  We have identified a number of key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  These include:</p><p>-   Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services </p><p>-   Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust</p><p>-   Publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible</p><p>-   Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance</p><p>-   Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance. </p><p><b>Registration of all childcare providers</b></p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for pre-school services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Pre-School Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All pre-school services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement. </p><p><b>Publication of Inspection Reports</b></p><p>  Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current</i> inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.  </p><p><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust</b></p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  </p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of pre-school services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.  The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. </p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for pre-schools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child wellbeing.  This work is being informed by the findings of the recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance</b></p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.  It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Pre-School Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.</p><p><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance</b></p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.  Gaisce also comes under the remit of my Department.  With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001.  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office and Gaisce who do not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.  Since I took office in March 2011, I have directly appointed 35 persons to the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis.

My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  </p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the Board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. </p><p>  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of  7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. </p><p>  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board. </p><p>  The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the Board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency.   Between March 2011 and 31st May 2013, 9 of the FSA Board members appointed by me had submitted an expression of interest.  Two other members appointed include an Officer of the Minister and a staff representative the Family Support Agency as prescribed under the Act.   </p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   I can confirm that since March 2011, there have been 163 expressions of interest submitted in respect of vacancies on the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department.  Of this total, 90 expressions of interest were received via my Department&rsquo;s website and 73 were recently received via the Public Appointments Service (PAS) who ran a competition for the filling of vacancies for the new Board of Management of the FSA.  I am currently considering all of these expressions of interest and I intend to appoint the Board of Management in the near future.  Pending the legal establishment of the Child and Family Agency (CFA), the newly appointed Board of the FSA will, in addition to its existing functions, provide oversight and direction to the organisational preparations which are underway for the CFA.   </p><p>  The expressions of interest received by the Department were submitted by a mixture of academics, professionals and other members of the public. Board appointments are not necessarily confined to those who make these expressions of interest but the process ensures that all those appointed have the relevant qualifications for the positions in question. </p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  </p><p>  I can confirm that there is currently once vacancy on the Board of Management of the AAI, 12 vacancies for the FSA, no vacancies for the NEWB and one vacancy for the Children Detention Schools.</p></reply>

To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.  </p></reply>

This is relevant to the Early Years Strategy as the Strategy is one of three, more detailed strategies which will be developed under the Framework.</p><p>  The Early Years Strategy, which will be Ireland's first ever national strategy for early years, is under development. It is expected that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education. The Strategy will further recognise the economic imperative and benefits accruing from targeted investment in early years interventions.</p><p>  Key issues to be addressed in the Strategy include:</p><p>- the further development of early childhood care and education programmes;</p><p>- the need to enhance quality provision, curricular support; and workforce capacity in early years services;</p><p>- support and regulation of the childminding sector; and</p><p>- the future development of early intervention, therapeutic and family support services to support young children and their parents.</p><p>  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the &quot;Growing Up in Ireland&quot; study. It will also be informed by the evaluations from the Prevention and Early Intervention Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources. The major programme of institutional change which is currently underway, including the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency, will also be taken into account.</p><p>  The results of a public consultation, undertaken as part of the development of the Children and Young People Policy Framework, is currently being analysed and will inform both the Framework and the Early Years Strategy. </p><p>  I have appointed an Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy, Head of School of Psychology at UCD, to advise on the preparation of the Strategy. The Group comprises external experts from a range of specialties, including paediatrics, early childhood care and education, child protection and public health nursing and is continuing to meet on a regular basis.  I have met the Expert Advisory Group on a number of occasions,  and I am very satisfied with the progress being made in developing Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.

However, an acceptable definition of public service regulator might be that it has functions in at least two of the following three areas of activities: the formulation of goals, the making of rules, [and/or] the setting of standards; monitoring, gathering information, scrutiny, inspection, audit and evaluation; and enforcement, modifying behaviour, applying rewards and sanctions.</p><p>  As a result, there is one body under the aegis of my Department that might be considered to fall within this definition of regulator, namely the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  The Authority is an independent quasi- judicial statutory body appointed by Government to regulate adoption in Ireland.  The total cost of running the Authority during 2012 is estimated at &euro;2.265 million and there are currently 24.65 whole-time equivalents employed.  Due to the nature of the work of the Authority, I have no plans to amalgamate any of its functions or roles with other regulators.  That said, administrative efficiencies are always under consideration and the Authority already utilises shared service facilities in terms of its finance and ICT functions and I will continue to support the Authority in terms of maximising any other efficiencies that it identifies.</p></reply>

The final report of the Review Group, which will include consideration of the wider issue of accessible transport, will be presented to Government in the coming weeks.</p><p>  On Wednesday 12 June, the Government decided to extend payments of Mobility Allowance by the Health Service Executive to those currently in receipt for a further number of months, pending establishment of new statutory provisions to support the mobility needs of people with severe disabilities, on the basis that this will prevent hardship, and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.  The Government is very conscious of the needs of people with a disability who have relied on individual payments of Mobility Allowance to support their independence and will take all of this into consideration when making a decision on future arrangements.</p><p>  Following detailed consideration of the Interim Report of the Review Group the Government has decided that new statutory provisions will be established to provide individual payments to people with severe disabilities who require additional income to address the costs of their mobility needs.  The Government has agreed that an inter-departmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, will now be asked to develop detailed proposals for the operation of the new scheme or schemes, including eligibility criteria and administrative arrangements, and should report back to Government by October.   </p><p>  The existing position regarding the Motorised Transport Grant remains as before, i.e. the scheme remains closed.  The inter-departmental group will examine this issue as part of its considerations of how future statutory arrangements should operate.</p><p>  I have arranged for the individual case highlighted by the Deputy to be referred to the Health Service Executive for a direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is not available to Home Helps employed by other bodies, who are not public servants.</p><p>  In June 2009, following a hearing of union claims for access to a pension scheme for staff of voluntary home help providers, the Labour Court recommended that this issue should be dealt with by way of a Gratuity Scheme based on 4.5 weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service, and that the scheme should take effect from the date of the Home Helps&rsquo; Collective Agreement of August 2000.  The funding of such arrangements this is not, per se, a matter for the HSE and, given the budgetary constraints under which the HSE must operate, the Executive is not in a position to provide financial assistance towards such arrangements.

Presidency of the Mechanism is shared by the EU and CELAC (Communities of Latin America and the Caribbean). Ecuador is the current CELAC President.  The location of the High Level Meeting alternates between each region and thus Quito was the location this year.</p><p>  The Minister of State co-chaired the High Level Meeting. This included delivering the opening address to the meeting on behalf of the EU, as well as co-ordinating the overall input of the EU delegation to the event. The meeting was also attended by the Ecuadorian Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs, the Vice Minister of Health and the General Attorney, each of whom the Minister of State had the opportunity to meet. </p><p>A range of topics relating to the world drug problem were discussed at the meeting. Particular focus was placed on four thematic debates on alternative development; drug prevention programmes for vulnerable groups; the effectiveness of drug policies; and links between illicit drug trafficking and other criminal activities. It also included a presentation by Ireland on the EU Drugs Strategy 2013-2020 and the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2013-2016, which was negotiated under the Irish Presidency and agreed by the EU Council at its meeting of 6 June. The substantive outcome from the High Level Meeting was agreement between the EU and CELAC on the Quito Declaration on Drugs.</p><p>Having arrived in Quito the previous evening, the Minister of State represented the EU Presidency at the final day of the 3rd COPOLAD Conference on 12 June (COPOLAD is a partnership programme between the EU and Latin America aimed at improving the coherence, balance and impact of drugs policies). The Minister of State delivered the closing statement, on behalf of the EU, at this conference. </p><p>  During his stay in Quito, Minister White took the opportunity to hold a valuable bilateral discussion with the Ecuadorean Minister for Health, as well as meeting with the Vice Minister of the Interior. He also had the benefit of lengthy briefings from the National Council for the Control of Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances (CONSEP). During these meetings a range of issues pertaining to the global drug problem were discussed and national approaches were outlined. The Minister also discussed broader health policy challenges at his meeting with the Ecuadorean Minister for Health, Ms. Carina Vance Mafla. </p><p>  The Minister of State was accompanied on the visit by his private secretary. Two officials from the Department of Health and one from the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade attended the EU CELAC High Level and the COPOLAD meetings in fulfilment of duties of the Irish Presidency of the EU. </p></reply>

Under Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015, this will ensure a clinically driven, nationally coordinated system to support all pre-hospital emergency care activity in the State.</p><p>  The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is taking steps to improve response times where possible, by addressing challenges such as reliance on on-call rostering, geography, resourcing and the use of emergency ambulances for routine patient transport.</p><p>  The NAS is moving its emergency ambulance services from on-call to on-duty rostering. This means highly trained paramedic crews are in their stations or vehicles to respond immediately to 112/999 dispatches, and they can move to optimal locations at any time during a shift.</p><p>  The national control centre reconfiguration project will produce one national control and dispatching system. With improved technology, this will allow the NAS to deploy emergency resources more effectively and efficiently, on a regional and national basis rather than within small geographic areas.  The project, endorsed by HIQA, is a key element of Future Health.</p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised  by the Deputy regarding provision of ambulance services in Co.Kerry, as this is a service issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive regulatory framework and the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland. </i></p><p>  All nursing homes are subject to the same core standards and regulations in relation to quality and safety in order to ensure the well-being of their residents.  Standard 24 requires that <i>&#8220;Staff receive induction and continued professional development and appropriate supervision&#8221;.  </i>  The underlying criteria require that </p><p><i>- &#8220;All newly recruited care staff and those in post less than one year commence training to FETAC Level 5 or equivalent within two years of taking up employment.  - - Long standing care staff have their competency and skills assessed to determine their need for further training and suitable arrangements are put in place to meet their identified needs&#8221;.</i></p><p>  In relation to home care, the HSE, as part of the home care tender process introduced written standards of care in 2012. These standards covered such areas as:</p><p>  - principles of service delivery</p><p>  - confidentiality</p><p>  - complaints procedure</p><p>  - protection of service user</p><p>  - consent policy</p><p>  - governance and management</p><p>  - workforce recruitment, training, staff development and supervision.</p><p>  The purpose of these measures is to promote quality and safety and to provide a more standardised approach to service provision nationally.</p><p>  The standards apply to all external providers, private and voluntary, who have been approved to provide home care funded through the Home Care Package Scheme.  Each Local Health Office area monitors the service providers approved under this process to ensure that the standards are being adhered to. Audits are completed and quarterly reports are requested and reviewed. Supporting this is the ongoing monitoring and review carried out by healthcare professionals such as public health nurses.</p><p>HIQA introduced the <i>National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare</i>   in June 2012. These standards set out the key principles of quality and safety that apply to all healthcare services provided or funded by the HSE.</p><p>Building on both the residential care standards and <i>Better Safer Healthcare, </i>the HSE has developed draft <i>National Quality Guidelines for Home Help Services.</i>   These guidelines are currently the subject of negotiations between the HSE and the relevant union under the auspices of the Labour Court.</p><p>  Home Help Services, as well as services provided as part of a Home Care Package are reviewed regularly by HSE personnel to ensure that clients care needs are being met. In addition, the HSE complaints procedures are available to all service users where services are funded through the HSE. Complaints are monitored as an indicator of quality of care provided and to ensure that clients needs are supported.</p></reply>

The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed last year by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. </p><p>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of pirfenidone and concluded that, at the submitted price, pirfenidone is not cost-effective for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). </p><p>The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.  The HSE has had negotiations with Intermune (the manufacturer of pirfenidone) in relation to the pricing of pirfenidone and is examining an offer made by Intermune. The offer will be assessed in the context of the procedures for the assessment of new medicines as per the 2012 agreement between IPHA, the HSE and the Department of Health. The HSE is carefully considering all the issues which arise in relation to the proposed benefits and costs of this medicine and expects to reach a decision in the near future.</p></reply>

Desired outcomes range from a return to full independence in social and work situations to a person requiring long-term support and care but with a higher level of independence than in the absence of neuro-rehabilitation.  Current services available include acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multi-disciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitative training services.  These services are provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and several non-statutory organisations.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE) have developed and published the &#8220;National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2015&#8221;. In addition, the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate. The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland, including key elements such as</p><p>  -  guiding principles;</p><p>  -  implementation structure;</p><p>  -  methodology for implementation; and</p><p>  -  information and communication.</p><p>  The Report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.</p><p>  The key priority areas, as identified in the HSE's National Operational Plan for 2013 are to:</p><p>  -   Map and develop Integrated Service Area level rehabilitation networks;</p><p>  -  Implement the model of care for rehabilitation services within the networks with a focus on community rehabilitation.</p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has been working in collaboration with the HSE's National Disability Unit as part of an expert Working Group planning for the implementation of the Report. The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy's recommendation of &#8220;hub and spoke&#8221; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community. This co-operation will continue in 2013.</p></reply>

It may encompass the determination of resource allocation to agencies based on assessed client need and actual costs, a &lsquo;money follows the client&rsquo; model, a brokerage system or a personal budget model administered by the individual service user.  With individualised budgeting, the main transfer to the service user is the transfer of choice and control over funding decisions, including decisions on preferred care settings and service providers.  Both the HSE and disability agencies are already working on demonstration projects aimed at giving service users greater choice and control, particularly in the context of facilitating people to move from congregated residential centres to community settings.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will pursue the issue of individualised budgeting in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Report.  The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from newer models of individualised supports through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.  The balance and emphasis will shift firmly and comprehensively towards these new models of individualised supports once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context.</p></reply>

Addressing this issue has been a priority for the health service and has included a number of recruitment programmes internationally.  As a result, over the past three years, the vast majority of NCHD posts &ndash; 98% - have been filled normally.  Where staffing issues exist, there remains sufficient agency staff to meet service needs.  This means that the hospital system has operated with a small ongoing vacancy level in recent years.  NCHDs are recruited twice a year &ndash; in January and July &ndash; to accommodate training rotations.  A number of recruitment processes are underway in preparation for July 2013. </p><p>  Improvements in staffing and processes overall in the ED at CUH include the recruitment of two additional Consultants in Emergency Medicine at the beginning of 2013, which ensures full Consultant presence within the ED from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  In addition, NCHD staffing has been increased by 5 WTEs.  A Consultant led Rapid Access treatment programme has been put in place to ensure patients are seen by senior doctors and treated and discharged within the shortest timeframe possible.  At CUH recruitment of NCHDs for the intake commencing 8  July, 2013 is still being finalised.  Not all registrar posts are filled at this stage and the hospital is pursuing a number of options to ensure a sufficient number of staff will be available.</p><p>  More effective use of staff in hospitals is also critical and in this regard the establishment of hospital groups which I announced last month will allow for greater flexibility and help address implementation of the European Working Time Directive.  The establishment of hospital groups will enable staff to be deployed under one management across the hospitals in each group to allow more effective use of skilled resources, removing any unnecessary duplication and concentrating where the need is most in the group.  It will  support staff recruitment to cover smaller hospitals, as staff will work both in the larger hospitals and be rostered for periods in the smaller hospitals in the group as required.</p></reply>

Under Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015, this will ensure a clinically driven, nationally coordinated system to support all pre-hospital emergency care activity in the State.</p><p>  The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is taking steps to improve response times where possible, by addressing challenges such as reliance on on-call rostering, geography, resourcing and the use of emergency ambulances for routine patient transport.</p><p>  The NAS is moving its emergency ambulance services from on-call to on-duty rostering. This means highly trained paramedic crews are in their stations or vehicles to respond immediately to 112/999 dispatches, and they can move to optimal locations at any time during a shift.</p><p>  The national control centre reconfiguration project will produce one national control and dispatching system. With improved technology, this will allow the NAS to deploy emergency resources more effectively and efficiently, on a regional and national basis rather than within small geographic areas.  The project, endorsed by HIQA, is a key element of Future Health.</p><p>  In relation to the particular information sought by the Deputy, as this is a service issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

In doing so I have sought able candidates  with experience or qualifications in finance (including audit capability and/or project assessment), law, corporate governance, marketing, IT, or  with experience relevant to the transport, tourism and sports sectors. I have received over 500 expressions of interest to date.</p><p>  I stated clearly that, given the importance of ensuring the right mix of skills and experience on every board, appointments would not necessarily be confined to those who had made such an expression of interest.  I may also decide from time to time not to fill all existing vacancies. All appointments from 8th April 2011 have followed these procedures.</p><p>  In summary, I have made a total of 114 appointments and 46 re-appointments since March 2011 and a number of other appointments are in the process of being made at the moment. Of the 114, 51 (44%) were from persons who had availed of the opportunity to submit an expression of interest.</p><p>  Also under the new procedures, all new Chairpersons appointed by me will generally appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee prior to their appointment taking effect.</p></reply>

A final decision on which cities or towns to include in initial phases will only be made following selection of a preferred supplier, when final prices from the tender process are known<font color="#1F497D">.</font></p></reply>

In relation to the IAA and CAR, I plan to amalgamate the regulatory functions carried out by these two agencies by end 2014.</p><p>  With regard to the number of staff employed and income and expenditure for 2012, these are available from the Annual Reports of those agencies which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas once they have been approved by Government. In relation to accommodation costs, I have forwarded the Deputy's query to the agencies referred to above for direct reply.
