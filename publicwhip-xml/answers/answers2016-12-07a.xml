The Governments would also have the option to take out appropriate insurance to cover any unforeseen events that would impact on the tournament.   In the event that the all-island bid is successful, Governments would split their support in a manner that would reflect the relative benefits of hosting the Rugby World Cup.</p></reply>

These five ports retain important roles as facilitators of their regional economies and, in some instances, as centres of marine-related amenity and tourism activities. However, the scale and nature of these activities are not such as to warrant continued central Government involvement.</p>  <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is designated under the National Ports Policy for transfer to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.   As the Deputy is aware, it was necessary to enact primary legislation, namely the Harbours Act 2015, to provide the legislative framework to allow for the transfer of the Ports of Regional Significance, to local authority control. The relevant legislation was enacted in December 2015.</p>  <p>  The Act is not prescriptive in relation to the model of transfer for each port. It is designed to provide maximum legislative flexibility by providing two possible models 1) retention of the existing company structure and transfer of the Ministerial shareholding in the company to the local authority or 2) dissolution of existing company and transfer of all assets, liabilities and employees into local authority structures. </p>  <p>  The process of transferring governance of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company to the Council is on-going. The future governance and operational structures of the port are primarily matters for agreement between the Council and the port company.</p>  <p>  The decision on the model of transfer will be informed by a due diligence process, carried out by the local authority, with funding support from my Department.</p>  <p>  The port and local authority are working together on due diligence which I understand is well advanced. When the due diligence is completed, I expect that progress will then be made towards finalising the model, the timeline and the preparations for transfer.</p></reply>

The Road Traffic Act 2004 makes it an offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a person under 16 years of age, including a gift or loan, with severe penalties on conviction.  Mini-motorised scooters, micro-motorcycles and quadricycles all come within the definition of a mechanically propelled vehicle for road traffic law purposes.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of the road traffic laws are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I am informed that they are satisfied that they have the necessary powers to deal with cases concerning the use of quads, scrambler bikes and similar vehicles under the Road Traffic Acts.  Notwithstanding this, I will discuss the matter with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality to see if there are any legislative amendments needed to specifically deal with the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-07a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120700069#WRB01600"><p>​It is the responsibility of the National Transport Authority (NTA) to conduct the current public procurement process relating to the tendering out of 10% of the PSO bus network. NTA is undertaking this by way of three separate competitions and has now completed the pre-qualification phase of each, and candidates have been informed.  The NTA has issued formal invitations to tender in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan competition and tenders are due by end-January 2017.  It is planned that documentation for the other two competitions - Dublin commuter and Waterford - will issue by end year, with proposals to be evaluated during Quarter 1 2017.Anticipating the timeline to complete the competitions is not straightforward; it seems that completing tender assessments and negotiations and awarding contracts and then mobilising new operators, including securing depots, will take at least 12 months and could well be longer.  I am told that, at this stage, it is expected that contracts will be awarded in mid-2017 with services coming into operation in late 2017 and during 2018.  Each competition can commence services independently of the other two.     The tendering processes underway should allow us to capture potential benefits as regards value for money in terms of the use of taxpayers' money in securing the provision of public services, and I look forward to the NTA's successful progression of all three competitions.</p></reply>

The boundaries of the aforementioned initiatives will remain in place. </p>  <p>  The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Study will include areas of those counties that border the Shannon Waterway on both sides.  Accordingly, depending on the recommendations of the Study, those areas along the Shannon may end up benefitting from the work of more than one brand. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Ballina and Killaloe are very much included in the area that is being reviewed. It is expected that the first draft report will be available at the end of March 2017.</p>  <p>  Given that this is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I have referred the Deputy's question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for direct reply to the Deputy.  Please contact my private office if you have not received a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-07a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120700069#WRB02200"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Transport Authority (NTA) is currently running a public consultation on rail in Ireland. It was launched with the publication of the Rail Review 2016 - which the NTA undertook in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann - together with an NTA consultation document "The Role of Rail in Ireland and Funding its Delivery".  Both documents are available on the NTA's website.</p>  <p>  The NTA's public consultation will run until 18th January.  Through the consultation process, the public and interested parties have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the future of rail. The purpose of the public consultation is to open up a public discussion on the role of rail and its funding and to provide factual material to inform that discussion.  The NTA will then prepare a report about the consultation process which I intend to bring to Government.   While there has been much speculation regarding the future of individual rail lines, I want to stress that no decisions will be taken on any of the options identified in the Review in advance of the full process of public consultation. </p>  <p>  The Review examines the funding required to support the heavy rail network now and into the future. It provides analysis of the company's financial situation, some possible funding solutions and some proposals for measures to grow passenger numbers. While considerable amounts of State support are already being provided for Irish Rail, the Review identifies a funding gap for Irish Rail of the order of &euro;100 million per annum. The funding gap identified in the Review is based on the projected allocations prior to Budget 2017. In the meantime, decisions on Budget 2017 provide for additional funding of over &euro;50 million to Irish Rail next year, bringing the total funding next year to over &euro;300m.</p>  <p>  This significant increase in funding for next year allows for increasing investment in maintenance and renewal of the network and the rolling stock, and also to provide more funding for safety projects. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I want to again emphasise that no decisions will be taken in relation to any individual rail lines, or any of the options identified in the Review, in advance of the full process of public consultation. In the meantime, I would encourage all stakeholders to avail of the opportunity to outline their views on the future of the rail network.</p></reply>

Rail services would have to operate at low frequencies in order to meet demand and this would be less attractive to passengers than a higher frequency bus-based service.  Buses provide greater flexibility within transport systems, catering for high volumes of demand in the city centre as well as diverging out to less-dense suburban areas.</p>  <p>  Funding is provided by my Department for the provision of public transport and sustainable transport infrastructure in the Regional Cities, including Galway, in order to encourage people to use public transport or more active travel modes including cycling and walking in order to reduce congestion and tackle emissions from transport.  The Regional Cities Programme funds the development of bus lanes, green routes, other bus priority measures and safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists.  Overall funding for this programme in 2016 is &euro;13.5m. </p>  <p>  My Department is strongly committed to both the reduction of traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. The National Mitigation Plan is currently being developed in line with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and my Department is actively contributing to its development.</p></reply>

It is fair to say that we will have to secure a step change in funding of public transport if we are to deliver and maintain a well-functioning transport system that will support economic recovery and deliver modal shift.  My Department is in close contact with the NTA about addressing travel demand growth in the Dublin region with a view to intensifying efforts to combat congestion in the short to medium term through greater use of bus priority, demand  management and  other alleviating measures.  I expect this work to allow me to make the case for increased public transport investment, as part of the review of the Government's capital plan in 2017.</p></reply>

For this reason, the company considers that the current practice of staff assisting boarding passengers, with ramps where necessary, is the best solution currently available.</p><p>To enable this, it is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's policy to have a portable wheelchair ramp at all stations and portable wheelchair ramps are also located on board <i>InterCity</i>trains.  A member of staff is required to safely deploy the ramp for use from either the station or train.  The only alternative to the use of portable ramps is for electric ramps to be permanently fitted on board trains; but the company has explained that, due to their complexity, electric ramps cannot be retro-fitted on to existing rolling stock on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network.  It is intended that all purchases of new rolling stock will incorporate, where feasible, new technological advances in wheelchair assistance. </p><p>In relation to stations, I understand that at least 84 out of the 143 railway stations on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network have received accessibility upgrades or were constructed new to accessibility standards.  Some lightly used stations may not be fully upgraded and instead, passengers with mobility and sensory impairments within the catchment area of those stations will continue to be facilitated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann through the provision of a taxi or hackney to the nearest accessible station;  this is arranged at a local level.</p></reply>

In the Plan, specific focus is being placed on the sectorial areas of electricity generation, the built environment, agriculture and transport. While responsibility for meeting Ireland's EU emissions reduction targets is a collective one, transport will be required to play a significant role in the national mitigation effort.</p>  <p>  The measures under consideration for transport will be wide-ranging and will focus on modal shift, behavioural change and large scale movement to alternative fuels and technologies.  Within this context, we must be careful not to undermine the capacity of our transport system, including the road network, to respond to the challenge of reducing emissions.  The delivery and maintenance of high quality road infrastructure is crucial for the efficient transportation of all vehicles, not least buses, coaches and bicycles.</p>  <p>  For future investment in transport infrastructure, my Department's overarching priorities are to achieve steady state maintenance of strategically important existing networks, to address urban congestion and to maximise the contribution that all our land transport networks can make to national development.</p>  <p>  Thorough appraisal of all new infrastructural proposals is conducted, to ensure the taxpayer receives value for money on the investment. This includes a full appraisal of environmental impacts, including CO2 emissions, and so the impact of transport infrastructure on carbon mitigation is fully taken into account in investment decisions.</p>  <p>As the Deputy will know, the role of heavy rail in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector is currently under review. The National Transport Authority (NTA) is currently running a public consultation on rail in Ireland. It was launched in mid-November with the publication of the Rail Review 2016 &ndash; which the NTA undertook in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann &ndash; together with the NTA consultation document &ldquo;The Role of Rail in Ireland and Funding its Delivery&rdquo;. Both documents are available on the NTA&rsquo;s website.  The purpose of the consultation exercise is to open up a public discussion on the role of rail in Ireland and the funding of the rail network and services. This process will give the public and all interested parties the opportunity to give their views and contribute to the debate on the future of heavy rail in Ireland.  The public consultation process will run until 18th  January and the NTA will then prepare a report based on the findings which I intend to bring to Government.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the Government has committed to a review of the Capital Plan in 2017 and I am determined to make a case for public transport investment to be both increased and accelerated in order to address our growing transport needs.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding, through the NTA, for the provision of public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford through the Regional Cities Programme.  This Programme funds the development of bus lanes, bus priority measures, green routes and safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists.  The aim of the Programme is to encourage people to use public transport or more active travel modes in order to reduce congestion and tackle emissions from transport. Overall funding for this programme in 2016 is &euro;13.5m.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the targets set out in Smarter Travel were predicated on investment of &euro;4.5 billion over the lifetime of the policy, which did not materialise due to the financial crisis which took hold in parallel with the publication of the policy in 2009.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, these goals remain the cornerstone of transport policy and are reflected in a number of policies being developed by my Department including the National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport, which is due to be published in the coming weeks, following our recent public consultation on the draft Framework.</p>  <p>  Our current investment programme continues to support a more efficient bus fleet and the commissioning of Luas Cross-City and the Phoenix Park Tunnel will contribute to attracting people out of their cars and onto public transport. We are also seeing year on year growth in the numbers cycling, particularly in Dublin. The mid-term review of the Capital Investment Plan in 2017 will afford an opportunity to seek additional funding for sustainable and public transport measures.</p>  <p>  In order for Ireland to effectively and equitably contribute to the EU emissions reduction commitments, an ambitious low-carbon development strategy, the National Mitigation Plan, is currently being developed. In the Plan, specific focus is being placed on the sectorial areas of electricity generation, the built environment, agriculture and transport. While responsibility for meeting Ireland's EU emissions reduction targets is a collective one, transport will be required to play a significant role in the national mitigation effort.</p>  <p>  The measures under consideration for transport will be wide-ranging and will focus on modal shift, behavioural change and large scale movement to alternative fuels and technologies.</p></reply>

This is a matter for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Cruise Stakeholder Group which lodged the formal planning application with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of the proposed development.</p>  <p>  The possible development of the cruise business was identified as one of the opportunities to be pursued in the Dun Laoghaire Harbour Masterplan. A Cruise Stakeholder Group was established comprising of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Business Improvement District. The Harbour Company prepared a business case for the construction and operation of a cruise facility. The study estimated that the cost of a new cruise berth of this size would be of the order of &euro;15m-&euro;18m.</p>  <p>  The expansion and development of the cruise business would offer some economic benefits to the Harbour and the surrounding areas. However, it is important to recognise that the cruise industry is not a lucrative source of revenue for harbour companies themselves and it can be difficult for investments in this area to repay their costs through charges or port levies.  Indeed, it is my understanding that any return to the Harbour in this instance would not balance out the level of investment required.</p>  <p>  There is no Exchequer funding for port companies and any cruise infrastructure developments must be funded on a commercial basis and/or through collaboration with those beneficiaries of cruise tourism, be they regional interests or the cruise operators themselves.</p></reply>

While not binding, their purpose is to launch a debate on the most viable options.</p>  <p>  The Paris COP21 Agreement of December 2015 underpins global initiatives towards emissions reductions. In October 2014, the European Council agreed to reduce GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 emission levels.  In order for Ireland to effectively and equitably contribute to the EU emissions reduction commitments, an ambitious low-carbon development strategy, the National Mitigation Plan, is currently being developed. </p>  <p>  The Plan will reflect the overall aims of the National Policy Position on climate action and low carbon development published in April 2014, which envisages that its development will be guided by a long-term vision of transition to a low carbon economy.  The responsibility for emissions reduction is, of course, a collective one and Ireland's EU emission reduction targets are national and not sectorial in nature.</p>  <p>  Transport will of course have to play a significant role in the national mitigation effort. The measures under consideration for transport are wide-ranging. They focus on encouraging modal shift from private to public transport, movement to alternative fuels and targeted measures aimed at promoting improved technologies such as the rebalancing of Vehicle Registration Tax and Motor Taxation in favour of cleaner-fuelled vehicles.</p>  <p>  These measures can apply to freight (including rail freight) as much as to passenger movement.  While the proportion of freight in Ireland moved by rail is low at present at a little over 1% of the total domestic freight tonnage, there has been some growth in recent years, with a 6% increase of rail freight tonne/kms between 2012 and 2014.  The Government's Capital Plan included a commitment to carry out a feasibility study into the potential to grow rail freight.</p></reply>

Some have departure/approach routes over hugely populated areas and city areas &ndash; the air routes to and from Dublin Airport go some way to avoiding dense residential areas.</p>  <p>  In any event my primary objective now is to take the opportunity, provided under Regulation 598 of 2014, to ensure that Ireland has a robust regulatory regime in place to deal with any harmful effects of aircraft noise relevant to the circumstances at Dublin Airport.  Following completion of the transposition of Regulation 598/14, for the first time there will be a designated Competent Authority with appropriate expertise to take responsibility for airport noise.  I believe this will be the best outcome to achieving aircraft noise management.</p></reply>

It will seek to promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more to complete a wage survey and is giving a strengthened role to the Low Pay Commission in relation to the gender pay gap.  Other Programme for Government commitments include the provision of locally delivered courses for women to assist their return to the labour market and to promote entrepreneurship. The Government has also committed to reducing poverty levels by supporting an increase in the minimum wage to &euro;10.50 per hour over the next five years.</p>  <p>  The preponderance of women on the national minimum wage was highlighted in the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s 2015 Report. In order to obtain a better understanding of this issue, the Low Pay Commission was asked by the then Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Minister for Business and Employment to examine this issue as part of its 2016 Work Programme, to report its views as to the underlying reasons for this position, and make any recommendations it considers appropriate. The Commission submitted its report to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on this matter in October 2016 and the report will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  From September 2017 a new Affordable Childcare Scheme will be introduced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs which will provide financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare, under a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare. The new scheme, which will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes, aims to streamline the existing targeted schemes to make them more accessible for both parents and providers, provide a fair and consistent scheme of progressive financial support towards the cost of childcare, with a particular focus, at least initially, on lower income families but also incorporating universal supports, and provide a robust and flexible platform for future investment in childcare. By achieving the above aims, it is intended that the new scheme will, inter alia, contribute to poverty reduction by ensuring that access to affordable childcare is not a barrier to labour market participation, including female labour market participation. </p>  <p>  Lone parents, of whom over 90% are women, are among the target groups of the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) 2015-2017, which is under the responsibility of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. This programme aims to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality by improving the life chances and opportunities of those who are marginalised in society, living in poverty or in unemployment through community development approaches, targeted supports and interagency collaboration.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Renewal Plan recognises the clear need to continue to increase female participation at senior levels in the Civil Service. To this end, the Renewal Plan contains a commitment to improve gender balance at each level by reviewing supports and policies to ensure these are impactful and measurable.  This work has commenced under the leadership of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is now a key project under the Plan.</p>  <p>  The advancement of women into leadership and decision-making roles was actively promoted under the National Women's Strategy 2007-2016. Public consultation has begun on an updated National Women&rsquo;s Strategy. It is anticipated that reducing gender inequality in senior appointments will be among the issues raised in the consultation and addressed in the new Strategy.</p></reply>

The CIF was established in April, 1985 by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland under a Scheme pursuant to Section 46 of the Charities Act, 1961. </p>  <p>  By virtue of S.82 of the Charities Act 2009,  all  functions of  the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland were transferred  to the Charities Regulatory Authority. This includes oversight of the CIF which is independently managed.   I am informed by the Charities Regulator that they are currently reviewing all legacy matters, including those relating to the CIF and ethical indices will form part of that review process.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Courts Service, in accordance with the Courts Service Act 1998, has a role in the management and investment of Court funds held in trust by the Courts on behalf of ward of courts, minors and other beneficiaries.  These funds are invested in line with the provisions of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958 and subsequent orders.   I am informed that, in accordance with the Trustee Act, and based on independent investment advice, the Courts Service invests a portion of these funds in equities/shares, including a small proportion in tobacco stocks on a passive basis.   I understand that the funds are invested in line with the FTSE All World Developed Index across a very wide range of diversified funds, in the best interests of the beneficiaries.  As of 30 November 2016, the % allocation within the FTSE All World Developed Index to tobacco stocks was 1.51%. This index is tracked by the Gross Roll Up World ex Eurozone Equity Fund within which the Courts Service invest a portion of the total investments. The total number of stocks within the index is 2,109 so it is a well-diversified index.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that both these funds are operated independently of my Department in the best interests of the beneficiaries, and my Department has no role in managing or directing investments.  Neither am I aware of all the investments, either directly or through a pension or other investment funds, by organisations that are in recipient of grant funding by my Department. There are currently no guidelines regarding such investments but the matter is kept under review.</p></reply>

Such investments should be considered in the context of ISIF's broader portfolio and the Fund's commitment to responsible investment. ISIF operates to high international standards and it recently published a Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy. In relation to investments in tobacco companies through its pension or other investments funds I will write directly to the Deputy in respect of this aspect of the question as the material in respect of the NTMA has not been made available in the time to provide a complete response.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) that its shareholdings with fossil fuel exposure includes certain investments inherited from its predecessor the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF).</p>  <p>  These shareholdings are in companies based outside Ireland and, as such, are held in ISIF's global portfolio. The global portfolio has been restructured and is being sold over time to fund Irish investment commitments as they arise, in keeping with ISIF's mandate to invest, on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment, in Ireland. Based on portfolio holdings as of 30th Sept 2016, ISIF's equity holding in the energy sector amounted to circa. &euro;11m (0.1% of ISIF's assets under management). </p>  <p>  Such investments should be considered in the context of ISIF's Irish portfolio and its significant commitment to renewables. ISIF's investment strategy is aligned with Government policy and the State's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy. ISIF published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy in July 2016 and this emphasises climate change as part of the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) into its investment decision making. </p>  <p>  Many major funds internationally have made significant divestments from fossil fuels such as coal, while other such funds have adopted an approach of engagement with energy companies to establish their strategy and positioning for the transition to a low carbon economy.  ISIF continually reviews its carbon exposure and the investment case for companies that may not be aligned with the long term transition to a low-carbon economy. </p>  <p>  In that context, ISIF is currently considering the investment case for companies that may not be aligned with the long term transition to a low-carbon economy. ISIF's senior management and the NTMA Board's Investment Committee have committed to reviewing the current Prohibited Securities policy to examine the potential of adding to the list of excluded investment categories.  This process is taking place in parallel with the ISIF Investment Strategy Review and is expected to be completed by end Q1 2017.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, which established ISIF on a statutory basis, provides that ISIF shall review its investment strategy after 18 months of operation. It also provides that in reviewing its investment strategy ISIF shall consult with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I am advised by ISIF that this review will be completed in the near future.</p></reply>

The NCSE has also advised that the current model can lead to unnecessary labelling of children from a young age.</p><p>The NCSE has proposed a new resource teaching allocation model which will, when introduced, remove the formal requirement for diagnostic assessment to access additional support and which will provide resources to schools based on school profiles.</p><p>Given that the NCSE has recommended the introduction of a new allocation model, it is considered that the best use of any additional resources will be to provide for the introduction of the new model, as opposed to revisiting the allocation basis of the old model.</p><p>As part the recent Budget announcements, I announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.  </p><p>An additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for around 900 resource teacher posts, which represents the period of 2017 from September to the end of the year.</p><p>Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months.</p></reply>

The contents of the Circular were agreed with teacher unions and management bodies.</p>  <p>  One of the basic requirement of the HSCL Scheme since its inception is the rotation of the HSCL post among eligible staff in the school or school cluster of schools at regular intervals, currently 5 years.  The rotation of the post gives eligible staff members within the school the opportunity to serve as HSCL Coordinator and to gain an insight and develop experience of educational disadvantage first hand.   </p>  <p>  Rotation of the HSCL post helps to build capacity within the teaching staff in the important area of parental engagement.  The HSCL role provides an understanding of the challenges in the home background and community life of particular pupils.

The Teacher Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers. The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes.

The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years. </p>  <p>  In the current year the issue of this limit and the purpose of the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.   </p>  <p>  I would advise that if the parents of the child, the subject of the question, have ongoing concerns in relation to their son's educational development they should, in the first instance, discuss them with the Principal of the school with a view to his raising the matter with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

Security of tenure under the Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles. Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period. This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except on clearly defined grounds which are set out in the Table to section 34 of the Act.  These grounds include that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, that the landlord wishes to change the use of the dwelling, and that the landlord requires the dwelling for a family member. </p>  <p>  Amendments introduced in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015   strengthen the protections around tenancy terminations by providing for measures that will guard against, for example, landlords falsely declaring that the property is needed for a family member, or that it is going to be sold. In addition, the Act provides for graduated increases in the notice periods that must be given to tenants of the termination of a tenancy so that a landlord must now give a tenant up to a maximum of 224 days&rsquo; notice for tenancies of 8 years or more. </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 has completed all stages in the Seanad and second stage is scheduled to resume in the D&aacute;il on 7 December 2016. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted by the end of the year. The Bill includes two significant provisions in relation to security of tenure. Section 30 contains a provision to deal with terminations in very specific circumstances, that is, where a number of tenants in a single development are served with termination notices at the same time. In addition, section 31 of the Bill provides for the repeal of section 42 of the Act of 2004, thereby extinguishing the landlord&rsquo;s right to terminate a further Part 4 tenancy in the first 6 months of that tenancy for no stated ground.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the number of families and individuals currently entering homeless services is unacceptable and that the period of time spent in emergency accommodation should be minimised for those that do enter homeless services.  Rebuilding Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness , provides for early solutions to address the unacceptable levels of homelessness, including the commitment that, by mid-2017,  ommercial hotels will only be used in limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families.  The Action Plan outlines that the housing needs of homeless households will be met through the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general housing allocations, and by providing new supply to be delivered through an expanded Rapid Delivery Housing Programme and a Housing Agency initiative to acquire vacant houses.</p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector. The strategy will include measures to address immediate issues affecting the supply, cost and accessibility of accommodation. In addition, the strategy will consider measures to increase security of tenure and, in particular, the potential of new mechanisms for both setting and reviewing rents. There will also be a focus on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply. It is expected that the Strategy will be published before the end of the year.</p></reply>

This brings to 28 the number of local authorities in which the HAP scheme is operational. The statutory instruments concerned, the Housing Assistance Payment (Section 50) (No.2) Regulations 2016 and the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) (No.4) Regulations 2016, which provide for the commencement of the HAP scheme and the related rent limits in these additional local authority areas, are available on the Irish Statute Book website at .

Of the 3,498 cases submitted, 2,642 were ineligible or terminated during the process for a variety of reasons. Of the remaining cases submitted, 669 are being actively progressed and 187 have been completed.  The MTR scheme is part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process. A number of amendments were made to the scheme in July 2015 to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers. Despite these amendments, the rate of uptake on the scheme remains low. The reasons for this are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the amendments made to the scheme in 2015, the Government has included a review of the MTR scheme as an action in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. The review, currently underway, is examining what further amendments can be made to the scheme to make it work better for borrowers and my Department is consulting with key stakeholders in this regard. The review is to be completed by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has established a new scheme to help people who are insolvent and in serious mortgage arrears on their home to access free, independent expert advice. The Scheme of Aid and Advice for People in Mortgage Arrears provides financial and / or legal advice and assistance to people in this situation. The aim of the scheme is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  It is my Department&rsquo;s policy to provide permanent accommodation insofar as is possible, while at the same time respecting the nomadic tradition of the Traveller community. In that regard, a scheme of loans and grants for the purchase of caravans by Travellers was established by Circular TAU1/2000, underpinned by Section 25 of the 1998 Traveller Accommodation Act.  This provision gives local authorities discretionary powers to provide loans to Traveller families for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation, i.e. loans for caravans or sites for caravans, subject to terms and conditions specified by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance. </p>  <p>  Cognisant of emergencies which arise from time to time which by their nature cannot be anticipated or planned for, my Department provides funding to local authorities of up to 50% of the cost of purchase of emergency replacement mobile homes. </p>  <p>  With regard to the individual case referred to by the Deputy, due to the medical circumstances outlined in the Council&rsquo;s proposals, my Department agreed, in this instance, to fund 50% of the purchase price of the mobile home for the family concerned on the condition that the Council pay the balance.  The Council were notified of this decision by email on 6th   October 2016.  Any additional funding apart from what has already been approved is not a matter for my Department and the Council was advised that any additional financial requirement is a matter to be resolved between the Council and the tenant in question. A formal response to the Deputy&rsquo;s representations on the matter will issue shortly from my Department. </p></reply>

However any customer who wishes to see an officer in Loughrea can make an appointment and they will typically be seen in a matter of a few days.  Where the issue is urgent, they can be seen that day.  If a person is unable to travel to Loughrea, for example due to illness, alternative arrangements are in place including arranging a house call, if necessary.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Inspector covering Ballinasloe is based four days a week in Ballinasloe, and the one other day a week in Loughrea Intreo Centre.</p>  <p>  The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As there are no agencies under the aegis of my Department the issue raised by the Deputy does not arise. My Department administers a number of funding programmes, including Ireland's official overseas development programme, Irish Aid.  Information on development funding is available on the Irish Aid website www.irishaid.ie. Smaller funding programmes administered by my Department include the Reconciliation Fund, the Emigrant Support Fund and from time to time my Department also funds a small number of other projects.    Through the Reconciliation Fund, my Department awards funding to organisations and projects aimed at advancing peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, on a cross-border basis and between Ireland and Britain. Information on Reconciliation Fund grants awarded is available at www.dfa.ie/reconciliation.  </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme supports Irish communities overseas by funding non-profit organisations and projects overseas which foster more strategic links with the global Irish and to support frontline welfare services that help the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities. </p>  <p>  In relation to organisations in receipt of funding, through careful evaluation and auditing of such organisations, the Department ensures the money spent is accounted for, represents good value for the taxpayer&rsquo;s money and minimises potential exposure to reputational risk. While my Department has no guidelines in relation to tobacco investments, given the nature of the organisations in receipt of funding, I am satisfied with my Department&rsquo;s approach to date but will keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

As a result, the Motorised Transport Grant referred to by the Deputy, has not been in place for over three years.  There are no plans for its restoration on the basis upon which it was previously operated.</p>  <p>  However, the Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments that support choice and independence.  In this regard, monthly payments of up to &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Programme for Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is seeking a solution which will best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the costs of their mobility needs, while keeping within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.

These Regulations which are a first step in the regulation of electronic cigarettes and refill containers will give confidence to users as to the safety and efficacy of products used for vaping. </p><p>The Regulations include the following provisions:</p><p>- Obligatory health warnings advising consumers that electronic cigarettes contain nicotine;</p><p>- Obligatory information leaflets setting out instructions for use and information on adverse effects, risk groups, addictiveness and toxicity;</p><p>- Mandatory safety and quality requirements setting maximum nicotine concentration levels for electronic cigarettes and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and containers of nicotine liquids.</p><p>In addition to the regulations under the Directive, e-cigarettes will be further regulated in Ireland through the introduction of a retail licensing system.  The legislation, approved by Government will also prohibit the sale of these products to, and by, persons under 18 years of age.</p><p>I engage regularly with my officials on this matter.

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public; </p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi. This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website. It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug. The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p><p>The HSE has recently completed its most recent round of negotiations with the manufacturer. On foot of this, the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee, having considered the NCPE recommendation and other expert advice, is in the process of sending its latest recommendation on the cost-effectiveness of Orkambi to the HSE Directorate. The HSE Directorate will then make a decision taking into consideration the manufacturer&rsquo;s latest price offer. This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>I share the HSE's disappointment that the manufacturer in this case has maintained a very high price in the course of negotiations in relation to the potential reimbursement of Orkambi for Irish patients.</p><p>I appreciate that this is a very stressful time for Cystic Fibrosis patients and their families.  However, I want to assure them that I do not consider this to be the end of the process. I would strongly urge Vertex, as the manufacturer in this case, to fundamentally reconsider its position and to table a pricing proposal which can facilitate the provision of Orkambi at a price that will represent value for money for the Irish health service, patients and the taxpayer.</p></reply>

The case regarding Grace (a pseudonym for the young woman at the centre of the alleged abuse) was raised by the Committee on Public Accounts in 2015 in the context of the procurement process for the Resilience Ireland and the Conal Devine reports and the extended period of time during which it has not been possible to publish them. </p>  <p>It is important to note that the HSE has always emphasised that it has not waited for the publication of the Devine report to act on its recommendations, and that it has put in place a number of changes to take account of the service and management deficiencies identified. This includes the publication, in December 2014, of its national policy:   Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse- National Policy and Procedures.</p>  <p>  In response to the concerns raised regarding the procurement and publication of the reports, the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch T.D., appointed Conor Dignam S.C. to undertake a review into these matters, taking account of the ongoing Garda investigation.  </p>  <p>   In relation to the publication of the Devine and Resilience reports, Mr. Dignam found that:</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s general approach to publication of reviews and investigations is not to publish anything which Garda&iacute; advise may adversely affect a criminal investigation, and he agreed that such an approach has very considerable merit; </p>  <p>  However, the HSE&rsquo;s decision to accept that the validity of the Garda&iacute;&rsquo;s opinions and wishes can only properly be made following an exploration of the case with the Garda&iacute;. The documentation does not show that type of exploration;</p>  <p>  Publication is ultimately a judgement call for the HSE, which it must make in the exercise of its statutory functions. </p>  <p>  Mr. Dignam further advised that there is no civil law bar to publication, and in the event of a criminal prosecution, publicity is unlikely to fatally interfere with a fair trial. </p>  <p>  In light of Mr. Dignam&rsquo;s conclusions, I asked the HSE to examine again the case for publication of the Devine and Resilience Ireland reports and, if necessary, to initiate appropriate discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to reach an early decision on the matter. In reply, the HSE informed me that it has commenced a process of engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enable it to make a decision regarding the potential for publication, in whole or in part, of both reports. The HSE has also reiterated its commitment to publish both reports as soon as is feasibly possible. </p></reply>

In relation to other agencies, I have requested the HSE and the agencies under the auspices of my Department to reply directly to the Deputy with information sought by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In relation to guidelines on investing in the tobacco industry, Ireland has ratified and is a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).  The FCTC is the first global public health treaty.  It is an evidence -based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health and was developed by countries in response to the globalisation of the tobacco epidemic.  It aims to tackle some of the causes of that epidemic and Ireland has made very good progress in implementing the FCTC to date.</p>  <p>  Article 5.3 of that legally binding Convention states the following:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;In setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Guidelines for the implementation of the above-mention Article 5.3 were developed to assist parties.  Paragraphs 4.7 and 7.2 of the guidelines state the following:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;4.7 Government institutions and their bodies should not have any financial interest in the tobacco industry, unless they are responsible for managing a Party&rsquo;s ownership in a State-owned tobacco industry.</p>  <p>  7.2 Parties that do not have a State-owned tobacco industry should not invest in the tobacco industry and related ventures.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that Minister Harris and I have recently written to the Minister for Finance in relation to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and its equity holdings in tobacco companies.  In the context of a review of ISIF&rsquo;s investment strategy, we have requested that the investment in tobacco companies be excluded from the investments undertaken by the ISIF.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-07a.586.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016120700078#WRL05400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 to 239, inclusive, together.</p><p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p><p>Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  </p><p>Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in Ireland in the context of the HSE schools immunisation programme,.  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 620,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.</p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a decentralised agency of the European Union responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  The EMA granted market authorisation for Gardasil on 20 September 2006.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a federal agency of the Government of the United States of America and has no role in the approval of vaccines for use in the EU.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on a government agency in another country. </p><p>No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level. In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  It would be inappropriate to comment on the details of individual clinical trials carried out by pharmaceutical companies. </p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Seizures, muscle weakness, leg pain, joint pain and chronic fatigue are not mentioned as known side effects to Gardasil in the Patient Information Leaflet.  There are no known long term side effects to the vaccine Gardasil.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. </p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website ().  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.</p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.  The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.</p><p>I am aware of media reports concerning the activities people in other countries, including Mr Alvarez-Dardet and Ms Ravasi, who claim that children have suffered adverse effects after receiving the HPV vaccine and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on media reports concerning the claims or activities of individuals in other countries. </p><p>The benefits of HPV vaccines  outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

The number of Basic Payment Scheme entitlements allocated to a farmer in 2015 was based on the number of eligible hectares declared by them in 2013 or 2015, whichever was the lesser. </p>  <p>  The value of entitlements allocated to a farmer in 2015 was based on a fixed percentage of the value of entitlements held by the farmer in 2014 and any payment received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme.  In this regard, if an existing farmer purchased entitlements under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme, this value was included in the calculation of their Basic Payment Scheme entitlements.</p>  <p>  During 2013 and 2014 it was widely advertised in the Media, CAP booklet, at farmer meetings and published in the Terms and Conditions of the 2014 Scheme that persons who did not hold an allocation right should not purchase entitlements under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme.  While such entitlements would be eligible for payment under the 2014 scheme year, they would not carry forward to the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015.</p>  <p>  The EU Regulations governing the allocation of entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme is determined at EU level and binding on all Member States, therefore I do not have discretion on this matter.</p></reply>

Better Energy Homes provides a financial incentive  to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating  systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).</p>  <p>  SEAI's policy is that to be eligible for grant aid, a home must be built and occupied before 2006.  Homes built from this point onwards have been constructed to the 2003 Building Regulations and so should not require significant insulation or heating system upgrades.  Proof of construction and occupancy is taken as the date the ESB meter is installed.  These procedures are detailed in the Better Energy Homes Application Guide. </p>  <p>  If an application were received that does not meet the criteria set out in the application guide, then SEAI have an appeals process that applicants can avail of.  If a homeowner can provide sufficient evidence to prove that their home was built and finished in 2005, then SEAI have the authority to re-consider an application, provided that the homeowner meets all the other conditions of the scheme.</p>  <p>  In general, I have no function in relation to individual grant applications and queries in relation to individual grant applications are an operational matter for the SEAI.  A dedicated hotline to deal with questions about applications is available at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members: oireachtas@seai.ie.  Such queries will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

In addition, the media coverage of sports events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.</p><p>Accordingly, I am very supportive of the ongoing efforts of the tourism agencies and the national governing bodies of sport to attract international events, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs/benefits involved in any State financial support, in particular the number of overseas visitors.</p><p>For example, the Government assisted the IRFU in its successful bid to host the Women's Rugby World Cup which will take place in 2017.  The Government also supported the FAI in its successful bid to host four games as part  of the UEFA Euro 2020 football championship and the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are supporting the IRFU in its preparation of a bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023.  Ireland has successfully passed the Applicant Phase of that process and is now through to the Candidate Phase.  The Governments will be working very closely with the IRFU to ensure that the best possible bid is lodged with World Rugby next June.  A final decision will be made by World Rugby in November 2017.</p><p>A number of other international sports events hosted in Ireland in 2016 have been supported by the Event Ireland division of F&aacute;ilte Ireland such as the <font color="#222222">World Masters Fly Fishing Championships, the World Karate Championships, the World Archery Field Championships, the World Boat Angling Championships, the FEI European Jumping Championship for Juniors, the Modern Pentathlon Youth A World Championships, </font><font color="#333333">the World Rugby Women's Sevens Olympic Repechage, the </font><font color="#222222">World Junior and Cadet Kickboxing Championships and the World Shore Angling Championships.</font></p></reply>

As part of this process, my Department has been heavily engaged in working with other Government Departments, and with key public and private stakeholders across the tourism and transport sectors, in analysing the implications of the UK exit from the EU.  I am meeting Chris Hazzard, MLA, Minister for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland on Monday next under the North South Ministerial Council framework to consider, amongst other matters, the transport risks and impacts of the UK exit.  Officials have also met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and in London as part of the overall transport and tourism assessment of these implications and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  The analyses is challenging as Article 50 is not expected to be triggered until early 2017.  The detail of the implications of UK's exit and future relationship with the EU will only become clearer as the negotiation process evolves.</p></reply>

The transport element of the Capital Plan does provide for some targeted investment in a number of new projects.  In addition, a number of other schemes targeted at removing bottlenecks and upgrading port access, will commence subject to necessary consents. </p>  <p>  It will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for national, regional and local roads and in the interim the primary focus will have to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.</p>  <p>  However, congestion, particularly in and around urban areas, is not sustainably managed by investment in the road network alone.  Investing in the infrastructure needs to be complemented by public transport and other measures to facilitate the movement of large numbers of commuters and other users of transport networks.  This too is reflected in the provisions of the Capital Plan.</p></reply>

The purpose of the consultation exercise is to open up a public discussion on the current and future role of rail in Ireland as well as the funding of the rail network and services.  The public consultation process is open until 18th January and no decisions will be taken on the future of the rail network or rail services until the public consultation process has concluded and been evaluated.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Rail Review, funding for the operation and maintenance of the rail network was significantly reduced during the economic downturn and has not recovered to a sustainable level.  The main emphasis of funding for the rail network under the Capital Plan is on the maintenance of the existing network to ensure it remains safe and fit for purpose.  Based on the funding allocations for public transport under the Capital Plan we should achieve steady state levels by 2020.  In view of the current constraints on availability of funding, this remains our focus, rather than expanding the network.  The Government has committed to a review of the Capital Plan in 2017 and I am determined to make a case for public transport investment to be both increased and accelerated in order to address our growing transport needs.</p>  <p>  With the funding available under the capital plan, we have been able to complete work on a small number of projects aimed at improving the performance of the network.  Work on the Phoenix Park Tunnel was completed this year and, as the Deputy will be aware, it opened for services on the 21st November 2016 enabling passenger services on the Kildare Line to continue straight into the heart of the business district in the city centre. </p>  <p>  In addition, funding under the Capital Plan has been allocated for the completion of the City Centre Re-signalling Programme and the construction of a new Central Traffic Control Centre which will improve rail movements through Dublin city centre and help improve movements more widely on the network as well.</p></reply>

Consideration is being given to the "Brexit" challenge in the context of various fora, including Senior Officials Groups, Cabinet Committees, and other work groups.  </p>  <p>  While there has been a significant devaluation in sterling, and a consequent negative impact on consumer confidence in the UK, all of the details of the UK's exit cannot be known until the conclusion of the EU/UK negotiations.  Of particular interest to tourism will be the implications for the border, for the Common Travel Area, for trade, and for the peace process.</p>  <p>  With regard to tourism, expert forecasting has highlighted the strong likelihood of a significant reduction in the number of residents in Great Britain (GB) expected to travel abroad on holidays, including a reduction in the number of GB residents expected to travel to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with the tourism agencies on how best to plan to respond to the known implications.  Importantly, Budget 2017 retained the 9% VAT rate which has been very beneficial to the tourism sector, in order to provide stability to the industry.  Additionally, Tourism Ireland recently launched its plans for overseas marketing for 2017 which include increased marketing activity in North America and Mainland Europe in order to offset the anticipated reduction in visitors from GB.  Other initiatives, under the Tourism Action Plan, are either underway or in various stages of development and are aimed at growing tourism to reach ambitious targets by 2025.</p>  <p>  Following on from the all-island civic dialogue held on 2 November my Department is continuing this consultation and is currently planning a sectoral dialogue with a theme of tourism and hospitality.</p></reply>

This is a direct result of excellent progress on major infrastructure investments such as LUAS Cross City and additional requirements involved in addressing flood damage to our transport network.  In that regard, I have sought a Supplementary Estimate which will increase my capital budget this year by &euro;96.1m.  The additional allocation is required to address repair/preventative works caused by severe weather earlier this year.  The funding has been allocated to individual projects across the country and will be used to complete motorway drainage and embankment remediation works and to repair damage to the rail network.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Government's Capital Plan, my Department and its agencies are pressing ahead with the key projects envisaged and I look forward to inputting into the mid term review of the Capital Plan which was announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on Budget Day with a view to ensuring transport investment remains a top priority.</p></reply>

In relation to transport infrastructure, I am confident that access to all the stadia would be well facilitated and a transport plan for spectators utilising rail, road and bus networks, with assistance where required from both Garda&iacute; and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, would be put in place.</p></reply>
