At present, my Department is liaising with local authorities in relation to increasing social housing targets and accelerating social housing delivery over the coming years.  Having regard to the Social Housing Assessment 2016 and reflecting the increased targets and significantly increased budget of &euro;5.35 billion provided by the Government for social housing delivery under <i>Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, new individual targets will be formally issued to local authorities in early 2017. </p><p>I can advise the Deputy that the Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016 is now well advanced and will provide updated figures of national housing need.  This updated information will allow for social housing delivery and resources to be aligned with the up-to-date priority housing needs locally.</p><p>In the meantime, social housing building programmes across all local authorities are well underway and continue to be ramped up.</p><p>It should be noted that the exact blend of delivery on new units between, for example, new builds and acquisitions, will depend in the first instance on the approach of individual local authorities.  Some authorities may, for example, pursue a greater number of new builds where the local market does not support acquisitions as strongly.  Other authorities may take a different approach and it is appropriate that, having regard to overall national targets, some level of local responsiveness is available to local authorities in their pursuit of the earliest possible delivery.</p></reply>

These include the four projects referred to in Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s Question, which have been advanced as quickly as possible, subject to the need to complete procurement and contractual arrangements necessary to ensure value for money.  I am advised that works will commence on each of these sites very shortly and units will be handed over to Dublin City Council, on a phased basis over the coming months.  Sites for a further 200 homes have already been identified and work is ongoing to identify sites for a further 500 homes to be constructed in 2017. </p><p>In relation to the unit cost for each project, this will vary from site to site and this information is financially sensitive, as Dublin City Council is in the process of finalising the procurement-contract phase for the four projects and a wider procurement framework is being put in place by the Office of Government Procurement. </p><p>As Deputies will be aware, I am rolling out the rapid-build housing programme in order to address issues associated with inappropriate hotel arrangements for homeless families and to expedite social housing supply.  This type of accommodation offers a greater level of stability for homeless families, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more co-ordinated needs assessment and support planning for these families, with access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services. </p><p>Funding for the delivery of rapid-build housing units is being made available as part of my Department&rsquo;s capital funding for the provision of social housing units.  It will not impact on the funding previously approved for other social housing projects, which will continue to be delivered under the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  The specific breakdown of the funding allocation for the capital housing programmes will be determined annually in the context of the estimates process.</p><p>I can assure the Deputies that rapid-build homes are being built to the highest construction standards, with a minimum 50 to 60 year life guarantee.  My Department is working closely with the local authorities, particularly in the greater Dublin region and other urban areas where the need is greatest, with a view to expediting the delivery of rapid-build units as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

The Action Plan, published on 19 July 2016, aims to deliver 47,000 units of social housing over the period to 2021 through construction, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, supported by Exchequer investment of some &euro;5.35 billion. </p><p>The Plan also provides for early solutions to address the unacceptable level of families in emergency accommodation, including the objective that by mid-2017, hotels will only be used for emergency accommodation in very limited circumstances.  The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 2017, in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation, will play an important role in the achievement of this overall objective.  However where families do find themselves in a homeless situation their needs will be met through the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment, general social housing allocations, as well as by the additional housing supply to be delivered through an expanded Rapid-Build housing programme and a Housing Agency initiative to acquire 1,600 vacant housing units.</p><p>The Action Plan also outlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure that services are fully responsive to the particular needs that might arise for families with dependents that are residing in emergency accommodation with a number of measures to be overseen by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  These measures include the appointment of a Dedicated Child Support Worker, assistance by Home School Community Liaison and School Completion staff, and access to cr&egrave;ches and preschool services. </p><p>Also contained in the Plan is a cross-Government action to ensure that young people leaving State care and at risk of homelessness are identified and catered for through appropriate housing and other supports appropriate for their needs.  My Department will allocate specific funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme for the accommodation needs, while the health and independent living supports will be provided by the HSE, Tusla and expert NGOs.</p><p>With regard to housing delivery, all local authority areas already have targets out to 2017.  New targets, reflecting the increased ambition of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, will be issued based on the Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016, which is now well advanced and will provide updated figures of national housing need in all local authority areas.  This will allow for social housing delivery and resources to be aligned with priority need.  In the meantime, social housing building programmes across all local authorities are well underway and will be ramped up in line with the new targets.</p><p>As outlined in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, continued collaborative engagement and co-ordinated implementation and delivery will be essential to ensure that the ambition of the plan is fully realised.  A dedicated Cabinet Committee on Housing, chaired by An Taoiseach, has been established to oversee both the development and implementation of the plan.  Progress reports on implementation of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>will be published on a quarterly basis and the initial Q3 2016 progress report is currently being compiled.</p></reply>

Between these three announcements, details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions.  Since those announcements, I have continued to approve further additional projects and details of these latest approvals will be provided shortly on my Department&rsquo;s website.  All of these projects are now undergoing planning and development work by local authorities; in parallel, the authorities are engaging with my Department in relation to the funding approval process.  On an ongoing basis, projects are moving through the four stages of the approval process according as they are advanced by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, and considered by my Department.</p><p>I am keen that these projects are advanced as soon as possible and I have assured the local authorities that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard.  I am pleased to see the increasing number of such projects that are now starting on site and advancing through construction.  Funding is drawn down on these projects separately over the course of the planning, development and construction work involved and similarly, tenanting is undertaken as soon as construction and fit-out is complete on each project.</p><p>With the project approvals referenced above, I anticipate a notable ramping up in terms of both construction spend and delivery over the next year.  The Deputy can be assured that I and my Department are committed to ensuring that construction projects are advanced in the most effective and efficient manner. </p><p>My priority is to deliver quality value for money social housing in as speedy and efficient a timeframe as possible.</p></reply>

These draft revisions proposed: </p><p>- the setting of a more stringent day- and night-time noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments, </p><p>-  a mandatory minimum setback distance of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and </p><p>-  the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. </p><p>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the 2006 <i>Wind Energy Development Guidelines</i>, which ran until 21 February 2014.  My Department received over 7,500 submissions from organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process. </p><p>As outlined in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, the Government is committed to finalising the revisions to the 2006 <i>Wind Energy Development Guidelines</i>within the first six months of coming into office.  The revisions to the Guidelines will be informed by the public consultation process and by best international practice.  My Department is continuing to advance work on the Guidelines, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in order to bring the matter to a conclusion with in the Programme for Government timeline.</p><p>The revisions to the 2006 <i>Wind Energy Development Guidelines</i>, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to such guidelines, issued under Section 28, in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

This therefore includes a mix of units from the existing housing stock and newly built units.  Overall, it is estimated that around 4,700 units could be secured for social housing from Part V agreements. The final delivery will ultimately depend on many factors, including activity in the private sector, capacity of local authorities and approved housing bodies and readiness of projects.  All local authority areas already have targets out to 2017 and reflecting the increased targets of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, new individual targets will be issued which will be based on the Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016.  The Assessments process is now well advanced and will provide updated figures of national housing need; this will allow for social housing delivery and resources to be aligned with the up-to-date, priority housing needs locally.

The Assessment process is now well advanced and will provide updated figures of national housing need which will allow for social housing delivery and resources to be aligned with the up-to-date priority housing needs locally.  Following completion of the Assessments process by year end, I expect to be in a position to notify local authorities of their revised targets very early in 2017.</p><p>The kick-starting of delivery under the Social Housing Strategy had seen a substantial new set of social housing projects launched, with almost &euro;680 million allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions.

The Programme further provides that we will investigate with all stakeholders how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.</p><p>The <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>emphasises the need to look at new ways of funding social housing delivery, in particular the need to provide structural, funding and policy supports to increase delivery of social housing by Approved Housing Bodies.  In that context, it states that support will be provided to an Irish Council for Social Housing/sector led new special purpose vehicle, involving investors which could potentially include the credit union movement.</p><p>The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has also set out a proposed means by which funding could be provided by credit unions to Approved Housing Bodies for the development of social housing.  My Department has met with the ILCU on a number of occasions to address technical aspects of its proposal.</p><p>The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016.  Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications, including to Regulation 25(2), which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature.  The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p><p>I acknowledge the modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing.</p><p>Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.  My Department and the Department of Finance met with the Central Bank on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.  This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p><p>My Department received an update from the Irish League of Credit Unions on its progress on 31 May 2016 and responded on 1 June 2016.  Since then, my Department has met with representatives from the ILCU on two occasions, during July and August 2016.</p><p>Ultimately, the funding mechanisms required will have to be put in place in the first instance by the ILCU itself, with the support of its members and with the agreement of the Central Bank.  My Department will continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.</p></reply>

Principle No. 3, which is particularly relevant to the issue raised in the Question, states:</p><p><i></i><i><i>&lsquo;Planning is about creating communities and further developing existing communities in a sustainable manner</i></i><i>by securing high quality urban design through the design, delivery and co-ordination of new development providing a good quality of life for all existing and future users of land and buildings.&rsquo;</i></p><p>My Department has issued a number of Planning Guidelines aimed at ensuring that new housing development is well located and supported by the required infrastructure.  Where planning authorities have not sufficiently taken account of these national guidelines, I have statutory power to direct a planning authority to amend a development plan under procedures set out in Section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).</p><p>At a practical level, these principles are articulated in development plans and local area plans which set the local context for the assessment of new residential development proposals.  These statutory plans have evolved over recent years to become more sophisticated in identifying the supporting infrastructure, including community and recreational facilities, required to develop sustainable communities.  At local area plan level, they now include measures to phase appropriate housing development in conjunction with the identified infrastructure to ensure the creation of high quality places for our citizens to live and work.</p><p>An example of the type of integrated planning which I seek to support is the Government decision to designate Poolbeg West in the Dublin Docklands as a Strategic Development Zone under section 166 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Dublin City Council is preparing a comprehensive planning scheme for the planned development of these lands, including some 2,000 to 2,500 new homes, as well as supporting social, educational and recreational infrastructure.  The process will be undertaken in full statutory consultation with the local community and other stakeholders involved.</p></reply>

This cross-Government plan is divided into five pillars, each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention.</p><p>Pillar 2, for example, entitled Accelerate Social Housing, provides for a number of actions to increase the level and speed of delivery of social housing and other State supported housing.  Significant funding of &euro;5.35 billion is committed over the period of the plan, reflecting the increased level of ambition, to deliver 47,000 social housing units, through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, between now and 2021.</p><p>Pillar 3, entitled Build More Homes, has a key objective of increasing the output of private housing to meet demand at affordable prices.  The range of actions are summarised in Appendix 1 of the Plan, and they include a new Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) with &euro;200m in funding for infrastructure to facilitate housing provision at more affordable prices.  The LIHAF is designed to relieve critical infrastructural blockages with the potential to open up lands and facilitate housing of the order of 15,000 to 20,000 homes by 2019.</p><p>In addition, a dedicated Housing Delivery Office has been established within my Department, along with a Housing Procurement Unit and a One-Stop-Shop for Approved Housing Bodies within the Housing Agency.  These arrangements will support further streamlining and efficiency within the various approvals and procurement processes that are required in order to support the delivery of value for money for public funds.</p><p>The Government has just given approval for the priority drafting of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which will give early effect to a number of priority legislative commitments in <i>Rebuilding Ireland - An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.  The Bill proposes a number of key measures including the introduction of temporary fast-track planning arrangements whereby planning applications for large-scale housing developments will be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the streamlining of timelines for presenting and considering local authority own development proposals through the Part 8 processes, including social housing proposals.  These measures will provide greater certainty in the planning system and facilitate the earlier provision of increased housing supply and help to address the current housing supply shortage situation.</p><p>I do not believe that setting up another body to deal with housing is either necessary or appropriate, particularly given the time and resources that would need to be developed to such an endeavour.  My focus is firmly on the implementation of the actions set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, with all stakeholders, including Government departments and agencies, local authorities, AHBs, voluntary bodies, and the construction sector, to achieve its ambitious goals.</p></reply>

At an overall level, while 25,000 new homes a year are needed to meet demand, output fell to as low as 8,300 in recent years.  At its heart, the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness is about increasing and accelerating housing delivery, across all tenures, to help individuals and families find homes. The active pursuit of housing provision on State lands, including local authority lands, is an important part of delivering on this overall ambition.</p>  <p>  This involves the State extracting the maximum value for its lands in the shortest possible timeframe.  In practical terms this should include accelerating social housing delivery, securing more homes at lower price points and providing homes to rent at affordable prices.  Local authorities are pivotal in managing the overall planning and development of such mixed tenure housing developments, and will likely involve tailored solutions for each individual case.</p>  <p>  Opportunities for private and social housing development on publicly-owned land banks can be advanced under a variety of arrangements.  The development of these proposals, including the delivery and financing models used, will be influenced by experience gained from such models as Dublin City Council&rsquo;s Housing Land Initiative proposals for mixed-tenure developments. </p>  <p>  In addition, Rebuilding Ireland contains a number of integrated actions to underpin land supply management, including the development of a national Land Supply Management Strategy, within the context of the new National Planning Framework.  This will involve identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed-tenure housing, including social and more affordable housing.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme and applies to all existing local authority houses, other than those classes of houses excluded under legislation.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  The terms of the Scheme involve discounts of 40%, 50% or 60% off the purchase price of the house, linked to tenant income.  On the sale of a house under the Scheme, the housing authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount involved.</p>  <p>  The incremental purchase charge is the first charge placed on the house, and would normally have priority over any subsequent charge on the property, including any private mortgage charge.  However, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides that a housing authority may enter into an agreement with a licensed financial institution, giving the incremental purchase charge a lower priority relative to the private mortgage charge. </p>  <p>  The Department met with the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland during the course of the development of the new scheme and will continue to liaise with them as issues arise.</p></reply>

Final delivery on this and other elements of the delivery of the 47,000 units will ultimately depend on many factors, including activity in the private sector, capacity of local authorities and AHBs and readiness of projects.  However, the estimation is that approximately 2,300 units will be acquired by local authorities and 8, 700 by AHBs.</p>  <p>  Those to be acquired by local authorities will include second-hand units and turnkeys, while of those to be acquired by AHBs, the majority will be funded using the increased financial allocation available for the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF).  This provides an upfront repayable loan of up to 30% of the relevant capital cost of acquisitions, where the units are made available under long-term availability arrangements funded by the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  This upfront capital and long-term support allows the AHBs to raise private finance for the balance of the cost, including from the Housing Finance Agency, therefore harnessing off-balance sheet mechanisms.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that 1,600 units to be acquired by AHBs will come via a dedicated &euro;70 million fund operating through the Housing Agency, which will facilitate the direct purchase of properties in trust from banks and investors for social housing use.  These units will be offered for sale to AHBs, allowing them to access the funding support available under the CALF and the SHCEP, to match loan finance.  A further 600 units approximately of those to be purchased by AHBs are likely to be financed under the Capital Assistance Scheme.</p></reply>

Action 5.1 of the Action Plan relates to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy and I intend to examine the potential to widen the geographical range of social housing location options available to persons seeking such accommodation.</p><p>The Strategy will examine the potential for bringing existing but vacant housing back into beneficial use and I intend to examine mechanisms to match such accommodation potential to prospective applicants for social housing, through measures such as the Repair and Leasing Initiative which will see up front financial assistance being made available to upgrade empty but sub-standard accommodation in return for leasing the property back for social housing purposes.  Acquisition and leasing options are also available to local authorities to ensure that households needing accommodation may be provided with that accommodation.</p><p>The development of a rural resettlement programme will be considered further, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural &amp;amp; Gaeltacht Affairs, in the context of taking forward these measures, the details of which are set out in the Action Plan, which is available on the website, <i>www.rebuildingireland.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The response to all emergencies is appropriately locally-led in the first instance.  The generic response arrangements are detailed in <i>A Framework for Major Emergency Management</i>(2006).  Specific guidance for responding to severe weather events is outlined in <i>A Guide to Flood Emergencies</i>(2013) and <i>A Guide to Severe Weather Events</i>(2010).  Local authorities have in place severe weather sub-plans based on this guidance material.</p><p>Met &Eacute;ireann alerts local authorities directly when severe weather is forecast and such warnings are received by a severe weather assessment team within a local authority.  The severe weather assessment team take the appropriate action to scale a response and to ensure resources are in place to support a response.  During last winter&rsquo;s flooding, this approach helped to anticipate and prepare for the response required by local authorities. </p><p>In their role as Lead Agency, local authorities carry out a number of functions during the response stage of flooding events and deal with recovery issues in conjunction with other responsible agencies.  The local authority role includes:</p><p>-  Coordinating an inter-agency response;</p><p>-  Continuously monitoring forecasts/alerts/ warnings to scale the appropriate response measures;</p><p>-  Operating Flood Defences and deploying sand-bag defences;</p><p>-  Clearing debris and fallen trees;</p><p>-  Flood Rescue and pumping water (fire service); and</p><p>-  Public Communication.</p><p>When required, local authorities liaise with the other Principal Response Agencies (HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) and, where necessary, activate inter-agency structures to manage the response.</p><p>The procedures for coordination of emergencies, such as flooding events, at national level are set out in <i>Guidelines for Coordinating a National Level Emergency/ Crisis Response</i>, published by the Office of Emergency Planning in the Department of Defence, in 2011.  This document also sets out the designated lead Government Department for 41 risk scenarios identified for Ireland. </p><p>Where a situation merits, national level support can be brought to bear and the &lsquo;lead Government Department&rsquo; will lead the coordination of the national level response.  The purpose of this is to bring &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; support to bear in assisting the local response if required, to manage the national level issues and to ensure that information is provided to the public.</p><p>As lead Government Department for severe weather, my Department convened and chaired a National Coordination Group on Severe Weather during last winter&rsquo;s flooding events on the basis of the Guidelines referred to above.  In accordance with standing procedures, all aspects of these severe weather events, including response and coordination at national levels, are being reviewed and any lessons identified will be incorporated into future operating procedures. </p></reply>

Expenditure by a local authority on improvement/extension works is regarded as an interest free loan secured by a charge on the house.  The beneficiary under the scheme is required to make repayments based on his/her ability to pay and the repayments are calculated on the basis of the amount of the loan and the authority&rsquo;s current differential rent scheme.  The administration of the scheme, including the assessment of applications, is a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Local authorities who require this funding submit their requests annually as part of their funding requirements under the Disabled Person grant scheme.  Only 4 local authorities requested specific IWILs funding in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Disabled Person Grant scheme provides funding to local authorities for adaptations and extensions to the existing social housing stock to meet needs of elderly local authority tenants or those with a disability.  It also allows for the provision of extensions where needed to address over-crowding (for families who outgrow their current dwelling).  Funding of &euro;13,374,473 has been allocated to the 31 local authorities this year under the combined Disabled Person Grant/Extensions/IWILs scheme.</p></reply>

A new Vacant Housing Repair and Leasing initiative is being developed by my Department to assist private property owners, local authorities or approved housing bodies to harness this potential and bring these vacant houses into social housing use.</p><p>While the details of the new scheme are currently being finalised by my Department, it will broadly operate by providing a financial mechanism whereby the cost of the repairs required to bring a property up to the required standard for rental accommodation can be met initially by the local authority or approved housing body, and then offset against the rental income over an agreed period of time.  A property owner will be obliged to make the property available to the local authority for a defined period in exchange for a guaranteed income.  The benefits of the scheme to a property owner will be upfront financing for the cost of repairs; guaranteed rent; avoidance of loss of rent during vacant periods; no day to day responsibilities for managing the tenancy or collecting rent; no advertising costs or vacant periods.</p><p>Eligibility for the scheme will be determined by the relevant local authority having regard to the location and suitability of the property for social housing and also the extent of repairs that might be required.  Proof that the property has been vacant for a defined period will be required.</p><p>The new scheme will be piloted in Waterford and Carlow, and depending on the take-up from private property owners, will be rolled out to further local authorities early in 2017.</p><p>Further details of the scheme will be available shortly.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, to be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.  In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them.</p><p>Reckonable income is calculated as gross income.  Income from social welfare payments is included in the reckonable income but only where these payments constitute a secondary source of income.</p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period.

Pillar 4 of the Plan commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector in Q4 2016.  The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  In developing the strategy all measures to promote long term tenancies and provide for increased security of tenure will be explored.  One of the specific measures that will fall to be considered under the heading of security is the scope for a move to indefinite leases, replacing the Part 4 four-year tenancy, and measures that may be necessary to encourage landlords to waive their right to terminate a tenancy in the event of the sale of the property.  A public consultation process will also be undertaken shortly in order to inform the development of the strategy. </p><p>The overarching objective of the strategy will be to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering choice for households and investment opportunities for providers, while reflecting the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.</p></reply>

Some 9,500 separate landlords and agents are providing accommodation to those households supported by HAP.  The phased nature of the HAP roll out has allowed for significant learning in the operation of the scheme.  In this way, new HAP authorities have benefitted from the experience of those authorities where the scheme has been operational longest.  The HAP Practitioners Group, which is made up of local authority staff and was established following a review of HAP governance structures earlier this year, meets regularly to discuss issues or opportunities they see to improve the operation of the scheme.  My Department continues to work with key stakeholders, like the HAP Practitioners Group, who are also represented at the HAP Project Board, to ensure that the scheme's operation is as effective and efficient as possible.

This will complete the full roll out of the scheme.</p><p>Funding for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme has increased year on year, since it commenced in September 2014, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of additional households being supported.  In 2016 Exchequer funding allocated to HAP was &euro;47.7m; 62% of this funding has been utilised to date and will be fully expended this year.  The majority of this funding is to support ongoing rental payments to landlords in respect of existing HAP households and the cost of additional HAP tenancies as households find accommodation through the scheme during the year.  Funding also includes the operational costs of the HAP Shared Service Centre, which provides a central transactional service for all local authorities where HAP is operational, and the costs of the HAP administrative payment made to local authorities operating the scheme.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government committed to extending the capacity of local authorities to make discretionary payments, while providing a framework for the review of both Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) rent limits taking account of geographic variations in market rents.  The Government delivered on this commitment with the introduction of revised HAP and Rent Supplement rent limits with effect from 1 July 2016.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all HAP local authorities from the same date.  Since the introduction of the increased HAP rent limits in July 2016 more than 2,500 pre-existing HAP households have received an increase in their level of support.  </p><p>In general, I am very satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.  Having said that, my Department will of course, continue to keep the operation of the scheme under ongoing review.</p></reply>

The Act also allows each Minister to expand the range of positive actions which public bodies can take for the employment of people with disabilities, and gives the National Disability Authority a special role in monitoring compliance and ensuring implementation.  However the Act does not prescribe how the quota is to be achieved, and this is therefore a matter for each employer.  I have no responsibility for recruitment by the civil and public service generally, or by any particular organisation.  In this regard, I would suggest that the Deputy contact the Public Appointments Service, who may be able to offer advice.  It may be of interest to know that my Department co-ordinates the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.  This is a cross-government approach<b></b>that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  Over the lifetime of the Strategy the public service employment target of people with disabilities will be increased on a phased basis from 3% to 6%.  Furthermore, special public service competitions for people with disabilities will be arranged, as will the opening up alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a key role in relation to this, as does the Public Appointments Service, and work is underway.</p></reply>

Persons who are currently in another EU Member State, including those in the camps in Calais, and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so.  We also need to bear in mind that a defining characteristic of the people in Calais, including unaccompanied minors, has been their very strong desire to go to the UK as their ultimate destination and that this is unlikely to change.  In that respect I do not see that a unilateral initiative from Ireland would be appropriate in this case, not least given the fact that this is a delicate situation involving the borders between two other Member States. </p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  Under the programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons overall under the EU Relocation and Resettlement programmes.  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  With regard to unaccompanied minors Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.  Tusla - the Child and Family Agency with responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State - will travel to Greece to assess the needs of those minors and plan for their care and accommodation upon arrival. </p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concerns in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group and I expect this issue to remain high on the agenda at EU level.</p></reply>

Part 10 of the Act is divided into five Chapters of which Chapter 3, consisting of sections 149 to 153, deals with the duties of legal practitioners in relation to legal costs.  The remaining Chapters of this Part, including sections 154 to 161, deal with other aspects of the new legal costs regime including the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators that will take over the work currently carried out by the Office of the Taxing-Master along with the way in which the new legal costs adjudication process will operate.  There is no impediment to these provisions being commenced other than that of ensuring, through detailed planning and sequencing, that the relevant legal and administrative arrangements are properly in place within the Courts system and under the new legislative measures.  It should be noted that the Legal Costs Adjudicators will, like the present Taxing-Masters, be officers of the Court.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that a significant transformation of the existing taxation of costs system is provided for in Part 10 of the Act and that this cannot be done overnight and must be managed carefully - including in terms of having the relevant personnel and expertise in place and given the fundamental legal procedures involved. </p><p>On 19 July, under S.I. No. 383, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act as necessary to get the new Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment.  Just last week, on 29 September, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Act.  Following on from the setting of establishment day, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year - with some carry-over anticipated into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function.  The current implementation period will, therefore, include the phased commencement of Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.  Following this, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The various legal costs provisions and Chapters of Part 10 of the 2015 Act are very much interlinked and will, therefore, be key to the overall success of the phased commencement of the Act over the coming period.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>The total strength of the Donegal Garda Division on the 31 August 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 387 with 23 Reserve Garda&iacute;.  The detailed information requested on the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Donegal Garda Division by District, on the 31 December 2008 and 2010, and on the 31 August 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is set out in the table.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014 and start recruiting again.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the<font color="#2F2F2F"> &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 and to double the Garda Reserve.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 14 of these have been assigned to Donegal.  Another 150 will attest later this year and will be assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Divisional policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream.</p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; also includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  Reserve members have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is important that we build on the very real contribution that they are making to the policing of communities right across the country. </p><p>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of this commitment and what steps might be taken to ensure that the  expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office.  I understand that Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually, starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 789 members to 2,000. <table><tr><th colspan="5">Strength of Donegal Garda Division</th></tr><tr><td>Districts</td><td>31/12/2008</td><td>31/12/2010</td><td>31/08/2016</td><td>Reserve</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td>191</td><td>175</td><td>156</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Buncrana</td><td>91</td><td>80</td><td>70</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Milford</td><td>56</td><td>54</td><td>66</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Glenties</td><td>57</td><td>58</td><td>*</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Ballyshannon</td><td>93</td><td>99</td><td>95</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>488</td><td>466</td><td>387</td><td>23</td></tr></table></p><p>*The amalgamation of the Glenties District took place on the 11<sup>th</sup>November, 2013 which resulted in the Glenties District being apportioned between Ballyshannon and Milford Districts.</p></reply>

In this context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Office of Public Works has developed proposals to extend and refurbish Donegal Town Station and these proposals are currently being considered by local Garda management.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that some 139 Garda stations, including Dunkineely, were closed on foot of the Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme, which was implemented in 2012 and 2013, following the completion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of a comprehensive review of its district and station network.  As the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at her disposal, the review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.  It concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  </p>  <p>  With respect to the reopening of stations, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible.  Under the Programme, the Government is committed to asking the Policing Authority to oversee a review of, amongst other things, both the boundaries of Garda districts and the dispersement of Garda stations in rural areas and I have asked the Authority to initiate the proposed review.  I have previously informed the House that I intend to put the outcome of the review before the House.</p>  <p>  The Programme also commits the Government to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify for reopening 6 stations that were closed under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District and Station Rationalisation Programme.</p></reply>

This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-vetting system.</p>  <p>  In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and in tandem with that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-vetting system.  E-vetting facilitates the online processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am informed that at present 85% of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-vetting system and the Garda Authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so.</p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application online and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.</p>  <p>  For those vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks from the receipt of the application by the Vetting Bureau and this represents a minimum timeframe given the administrative input required.</p>  <p>  Processing times for applications can be longer in some individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:  </p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  -  be without both hands or without both arms; </p>  <p>  -  be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  The Medical Board of Appeal's clinical determination is limited to the scope of the six qualifying criteria, and the Board does not have discretion in relation to the application of these criteria.  The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014.  These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

The Initiative was extended beyond the original planned pilot cities of Limerick and Waterford, to include the cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Kilkenny.  In line with my Department's commitment to evidence based policy-making, the inclusion of these additional four cities followed the completion of a comprehensive, independent ex-ante cost benefit analysis.</p>  <p>  To date, take-up of the scheme has been lower than anticipated and as a result the Government has committed to introducing changes to the Initiative to make it more effective.  Analysis is being undertaken, including a review of the initial take-up, in order to learn more about how the Initiative might be more effective.  The aim is to get the design of the Initiative right so that it can work in an effective manner.  Once this is achieved, it will then be possible to consider how, or if, the Initiative could be extended to other locations.  The Deputy will be aware of a further commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government, to examine the introduction of a similar scheme to the "Living City Initiative" to regenerate town centres and villages throughout Ireland.  It is important that the underpinning scheme is made more effective, as until that has been achieved, extension of eligibility for it to other towns would be largely meaningless.</p>  <p>  Any announcements in relation to the Initiative will be made in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill. </p></reply>

These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2014, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  They are estimated by reference to projected 2017 incomes. They are provisional and may be revised.  </p>  <p>  In the event that I make no change to the entry threshold for USC in the Budget, it is estimated that 748,000 individuals would be exempt from USC in 2017 on the basis that their USC-liable income would be below &euro;13,000.</p>  <p>  While step effects are never ideal, they are often a feature of tax systems with exemption thresholds, as the application of a tax on this basis allows those with incomes below the threshold to be supported by means of the exemption, while also achieving the required yield from the tax.  The Deputy may be aware that both the Income Levy and the Health Levy, which were replaced by the USC, also had step effects.  The Health Levy in particular had a significant step effect of &euro;1,040 per annum, or &euro;20 per week, when weekly earnings exceeded &euro;500.</p>  <p>  PRSI also had a step effect for employees which existed for many years, and which was a significant issue for workers earning just over the PRSI entry threshold of &euro;352 per week.  The Deputy will be aware that I addressed this issue in Budget 2016 through the introduction of a new tapered PRSI Credit, which took effect from 1 January this year.  This credit smoothes entry into the PRSI system for employees on lower incomes, without providing an additional benefit to higher income-earners.</p>  <p>  As the USC step occurs at a lower income threshold and a low tax rate, its effect is much less significant than the steps of the two levies it replaced.  In 2015, the USC step was just over &euro;180 annually, or &euro;3.46 per week.  The Deputy will be aware that in Budget 2016 I reduced the two lower rates of USC by a half of one percent each with effect from 1 January this year.  Therefore, notwithstanding the increase in the USC exemption threshold to &euro;13,000, Budget 2016 actually reduced the USC step to under &euro;150, or &euro;2.88 per week.</p>  <p>  As regards future measures, in the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the Universal Social Charge (USC) as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-05a.244.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100500076#WRJ02500"><p>The 9% reduced VAT rate for tourism related services was introduced in July 2011 as part of the Government Jobs Initiative.  The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector.  The tourism sector is a key sector in the Irish Economy and the introduction of the 9% VAT rate was aimed at reducing costs during a very challenging time for the sector.  The objective was to boost tourism and create additional jobs.  While the VAT rate was due to revert to 13.5% in 2014, I retained the 9% rate on tourism activity in Budget 2014 because the initiative had proved to be a major success.  Between the second quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2016, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of people working in the Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services Sector nationally increased by 31,000, taking total employment from 114,900 to 145,900.  This increase of 27% compares to an increase of 7.2% in overall employment over the same period indicating that the measure may have been successful in terms of job creation and has made a significant impact on the competitiveness of the tourism product. </p>  <p>  The Government, in the Programme for Partnership Government, has committed to increasing revenue from overseas visitors, growing employment in the tourism sector and increasing the number of visits to Ireland, through the retention of the 9% VAT rate on tourism related services, among other measures, providing that prices remain competitive.  With reports of rising prices within the tourism sector, particularly in Dublin, it is incumbent on the industry to ensure that this relief continues to be passed through fully to the consumer.  My Department will continue to monitor developments in this regard.</p></reply>

I am advised by NAMA that, other than a small number of staff re-assigned from other functions within the NTMA, NAMA staff are employed on the basis of specified purpose contracts i.e. their employment lasts for as long as NAMA requires their particular function.</p>  <p>   I am further advised that, since inception, staff assigned to NAMA have a 3 month notice period provision in their contracts.  Following a review of NTMA notice periods and post termination restrictions of employment, a provision prohibiting certain activities in an employee's subsequent employment for a defined period of time has also been introduced on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  In addition, I would draw the Deputy's attention the NAMA Board's voluntary policy which sets out that non-executive NAMA Board members should not, within three months of retiring /resigning from the Board:</p>  <p> - accept an offer of employment or other appointment,</p>  <p> - accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project,</p>  <p> or </p>  <p> - accept a directorship or other similar opportunity,</p>  <p> where the nature and terms of such employment, appointment or engagement could reasonably be considered to lead to a conflict of interest or the perception of such, without first obtaining the approval from the Board of NAMA.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of Section 202 provisions in the NAMA Act, which are lifelong provisions with respect to confidentiality for all current and former staff assigned to NAMA and to members of the NAMA Board.</p>  <p>  I have also been advised that all NAMA officers are provided with a copy of the "Code of Practice Conduct of Officers of NAMA" when they are assigned to NAMA and they are required to sign an undertaking that they have read, understood and will comply with it.  This document, which is published on the NAMA website, sets out in detail the obligations of officers of NAMA with respect to confidentiality and conflicts of interest including statutory obligations regarding confidentiality and use of information including their obligation under the Official Secrets Act 1963.  The document is reviewed annually by the Board of NAMA and circulated annually to officers of NAMA, who are required to sign an undertaking on each occasion that they have read, understood and will comply with it.</p>  <p>  In addition, those officers of NAMA who are holders of designated positions of employment under the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 as amended by the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 ("the Ethics Acts") are notified in January each year of their obligations under the Ethics Acts. </p>  <p>  NAMA requires its entire staff to complete a disclosure under Section 42 of the NAMA Act outlining all assets, liabilities and interests which they hold. Each employee is also required to inform the CEO of NAMA of any changes to their disclosure and to immediately inform the CEO of any matter that could raise a question about their suitability to act (or continue to act) as an officer of NAMA or that could result in an actual or potential conflict of interest with respect to their duties or obligations as an officer of NAMA. </p></reply>

Consequently, while I have decided not to  reconstitute the Motor Insurance Advisory Board at this time, I have instead established a Cost of Insurance Working Group chaired by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D.. This Working Group consists of a number of relevant Government Departments, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the State Claims Agency.The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector. </p><p>The core areas to be examined by the Working Group in the first phase are: </p><p>- The motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years </p><p>- The effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs </p><p>- The current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims</p><p>- Insurance data and information </p><p>- The impact of accident rates </p><p>- The impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector, and </p><p>- Other market issues</p><p>A number of additional issues which impact upon consumers and the business sector in relation to motor insurance are also being considered.  These include: </p><p>- The lack of a link between the National Car Test and the availability of insurance,</p><p>-  Insurance costs for young drivers, and those over 65,</p><p>- The case for rural dwellers with no public transport to have car insurance at a reasonable cost, </p><p>- The issue of returning immigrants having difficulty obtaining car insurance,</p><p>- The cost of insurance to taxi drivers, hackneys and hauliers. </p><p>- The issue of insurance companies denying coverage to cars over 10 years or older.</p><p>Because the issue of the cost of insurance is complex and in order to get to the heart of these issues as soon as possible, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D. has established four sub-groups to review them in detail. Chairs have been appointed to these sub-groups and work has already commenced. The sub-groups are meeting weekly and their outputs will feed into the meetings of the Working Group. The Working Group has held five meetings to date and will continue to meet every two to three weeks to the end of 2016.</p><p>The consultation process has commenced. Minister of State Murphy has had informal meetings with representatives from a number of key stakeholders including: Insurance Ireland, AA Ireland, the Injuries Board, the Irish Brokers Association, IBEC, FBD Insurance, and the Central Bank of Ireland. The Working Group and the four sub-groups are also meeting with the relevant stakeholders. The Working Group has met with representatives from the Law Society, AA Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Irish Car Rental Council, the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Consumers Association of Ireland. Further consultations will be arranged. In addition, submissions received from all interested parties will be considered as part of the process.</p><p>By the end of October, the Working Group will provide me with an update report which will set out the priority actions required. From November to December, the Working Group will then develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions. </p></reply>

The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report of the study was published in November 2015.</p>  <p>  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the Hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one of the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Established earlier this year, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group is being chaired for the first year by SOLAS.  Membership of the Group includes the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licensed Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Group has met several times since it was established and a number of key actions are being progressed including an audit of courses and culinary facilities within both the Further and Higher education sectors with a view to obtaining a complete overview of existing courses and facilities, with a view to identifying gaps in provision and encouraging collaboration and sharing of facilities where possible.</p>  <p>  Since the EGFSN study has been carried out, new developments in providing for the skill needs of the sector have included: </p>  <p>  - Approximately 220 free hospitality-related higher education places under the 2016 Springboard+ programme. </p>  <p>  - A proposal to develop a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship is at an advanced stage and is due to commence in the coming months, with training courses taking place in Education and Training Boards (ETBs) along with a work placement component.</p>  <p>  - A proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship has been approved for development funding by the Apprenticeship Council at its last meeting in September. </p>  <p>  - New Career Traineeships in Hospitality are being rolled out by a number of ETBs on a pilot basis with over 100 participants engaging so far. These are shorter courses, typically of up to 12 months duration.</p>  <p>  In addition, Skillnets Limited is  scoping opportunities to establish a dedicated network to serve the needs of the sector and has held a series of meetings with representatives of the industry.</p>  <p>  The skill needs of the hospitality sector will also be addressed through the new skills architecture established under the Government&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, which includes the 9 Regional Skills Fora. </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 made provision for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools in the current school year.  These posts provided for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhanced the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, improved the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and provided additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p>  <p>  At primary level a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule has been implemented for the 2016/17 school year.  The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils.  Lower thresholds apply for DEIS Band 1 schools. </p>  <p>  At post primary level, the 2016 budget provided an improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation from September 2016 for the purpose of enhancing guidance provision.  It brings the basis of allocation from 18.25:1 to 17.25:1 in DEIS schools and from 19:1 to 18.7:1 in other schools for the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  The commitments in the Programme for Government, including the pupil-teacher ratio, will be considered in the context of the budgetary process. </p></reply>

Section 30 prohibits payment by the State of people employed as teachers in recognised schools unless they are registered with the Teaching Council.</p><p>Circular 31/2011 on Teacher Recruitment, Registration and Qualifications sets out the procedures regarding the employment of qualified registered teachers in approved teaching posts. </p><p>Paragraph 3.4 of Circular 0031/2011 states as follows: </p><blockquote>Where an employer can satisfactorily demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an appropriately qualified registered teacher, a teacher registered under any regulation of the Teaching Council [Registration] Regulations 2009 may be appointed pending the recruitment of an appropriately qualified registered teacher. The contract of employment must include a condition that the contract will terminate on the recruitment of an appropriately qualified registered teacher or the following 31 August, whichever happens first. Remuneration will be at the unqualified rate of pay. </blockquote><p>Paragraph 6.3 of Circular 0031/2011 states:</p><blockquote>An unregistered person employed in accordance with paragraph 6.1&ndash;<br /><br />(a) will be paid at the unqualified rate of pay;<br /><br />(b) may not be paid in respect of more than one week&rsquo;s continuous employment at any one time; and<br /><br />(c) must have included in his or her contract of employment a condition that the contract will terminate immediately if the employer is in a position to employ a registered teacher</blockquote><p>The teacher referred to by the Deputy was registered with the Teaching Council from 4 May 2016 for the Further Education sector.

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum, having been in receipt of social housing support for at least 1 year and having been allocated a house under a local authority allocation scheme.</p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them. </p><p>Reckonable income is calculated as gross income.  Income from social welfare payments is included in the reckonable income but only where these payments constitute a secondary source of income. </p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period.  This ensures compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>and reaffirmed in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme in January 2017 following the first 12 months of operation and I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage.</p></reply>

Local authorities and my Department are working closely together in order to ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.  HAP is now available to all qualified households in 19 local authority areas with over 13,600 households currently being supported by the scheme and 9,500 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to those households. </p><p>The Homelessness Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, i.e. Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of this pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.</p><p>While eligible homeless households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Place-Finder Service, has also been established to engage directly with property-owners and support qualified households to find suitable tenancies and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place.

My Department does not hold data on the number of homeless households that have sourced accommodation under the homeless HAP scheme without the assistance of the Dublin Place-Finder Service .</p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>commits to meeting the housing needs of 1,750 homeless households through the Homelessness Pilot of the HAP scheme over 2016 and 2017, as part of the overall accelerated HAP target of supporting 27,000 new households over the same period.  There are currently 573 households being supported by the Homelessness Pilot of the HAP scheme across the four Dublin local authority areas.

The full roll-out of the scheme to all remaining local authorities, including the remaining Dublin local authorities, is currently being planned.

The Direction was subsequently renewed on two occasions, with the last renewal expiring on 30 April 2016.  At the time of the last renewal in February 2016, the Housing Agency was requested to conduct a review of the operation of the Direction and provide an impartial assessment.   </p>  <p>  The Agency recommended that the Direction should be allowed to lapse upon its expiry date. </p>  <p>  This Direction was only ever intended to operate for a short period of time to provide an immediate increase in the number of social housing tenancies being allocated to homeless households.  In the normal course, local authorities and their elected members are best placed to determine the allocation of social housing for their own areas, in line with national policy.   </p>  <p>  Among the Agency&rsquo;s findings was that the well-established allocation procedures of housing authorities are capable of responding to particular housing need without an on-going Ministerial Direction.  This analysis is vindicated by the fact that, in the first 6 months of this year, local authorities nationally have assisted more than 1,350 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies, with almost half of these going into social housing tenancies. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the Housing Agency report, my predecessor decided not to renew the terms of this Direction.  I do not intend to revisit the matter as I am confident that the comprehensive range of actions and initiatives underway to increase housing supply generally, as set out in Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, will enable local authorities to maintain or indeed exceed the level of housing allocations to homeless households and other vulnerable groups achieved under the Ministerial Direction.</p></reply>

The Government recognises the major challenges presented by the shortage of housing at affordable prices, rising rents and the unacceptably high level of homelessness.  That is why, in publishing the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Government has set out a practical and readily implementable set of actions to create a functioning and sustainable housing system.  The Action Plan includes more than 80 separate actions and is very much focussed on the increased supply of affordable homes in the right locations.  Rebuilding Ireland can be accessed at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>The Plan also commits to the introduction of a new pilot affordable rental scheme, to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households, currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  The objective of this scheme will be to provide long-term affordable accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand and to provide an economic incentive to increase supply of rental accommodation.  Subject to the finalisation of the scheme by Government and market uptake thereafter, the scheme is expected to deliver at least 2,000 rental properties over a range of projects by 2018.</p><p>Any housing-related taxation matters are a matter for the Minister for Finance to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contains a number of integrated actions to underpin land supply management, including the development of a national Land Supply Management Strategy, within the context of the new National Planning Framework , which is due for publication in the first half of 2017.  This will involve identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed-tenure housing, including social and more affordable housing.  In addition, it is envisaged that local authorities will be supported in acquiring housing lands in key developable areas, and strategic opportunities for urban renewal and regeneration will be identified for co-ordinated action across relevant public sector bodies. </p><p>Furthermore, the Housing Agency, in consultation with my Department and local authorities, has already commenced the mapping of the circa 700 sites in local authority ownership and those held by the Agency under the Land Aggregation Scheme, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.  The map will be made available in due course and will be updated to record the development and use of these lands.</p><p>The Action Plan also proposes the development of new approaches to local authority housing strategies, as part of their statutory development plans, with a particular focus on the selection of privately owned sites for delivery of starter homes at affordable prices to meet housing needs across their area, across tenures and types as well as meeting the social housing requirement.</p><p>In 2014, my Department, in conjunction with local authority planning departments, carried out a national survey of all lands zoned for residential development in statutory local authority development plans and local area plans across Ireland.  The results of the survey indicated that there were 17,434 hectares of residential zoned lands nationally, which could support the construction of over 414,000 dwellings.

In Dublin City Council&rsquo;s case, the target is 3,347 additional units to be delivered through build, buying, refurbishment and leasing programmes, supported by a funding allocation of almost &euro;300 million.</p><p>Reflecting the increased targets of Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, new individual targets will be issued which will be based on the Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016.  The Assessment process is now well advanced and will provide updated figures of national housing need which will allow for social housing delivery and resources to be aligned with the up-to-date, priority housing needs locally.  Following completion of the Assessments process by year end, I expect to be in a position to notify local authorities of their revised targets very early in 2017.</p><p>Of the 47,000 social housing units to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, it is estimated at this stage that approximately 26,000 will be constructed, while 11,000 will be acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies directly from the market or the Housing Agency, with a portion of these being newly built units.  10,000 units will be leased by local authorities and approved housing bodies, which includes an estimated 5,000 units to be sourced from the NTMA Special Purpose Vehicle and a further 5,000 properties to be secured from a combination of the Repair and Leasing Initiative that will be piloted shortly and under long-term lease arrangements by local authorities and approved housing bodies from a range of different sources, not including Part V.  This therefore includes a mix of units from the existing housing stock and newly built units.  Overall, it is estimated that around 4,700 units could be secured for social housing from Part V agreements.  However, the final delivery will ultimately depend on many factors, including activity in the private sector, capacity of local authorities and approved housing bodies and readiness of projects.</p><p>Information on social housing units purchased in respect of all local authorities funded by direct capital investment by my Department is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>Data in relation to 2016 are currently being collated and will be published shortly.  The allocation of properties to families is a matter for the local authority.</p><p>There will always be a level of vacant social houses.  The number of vacant properties changes on a daily basis with local authorities having social units handed back and having units to be re-let.  The number of vacant units will therefore fluctuate constantly, as would be expected in the management of the thousands of homes owned by the local authorities, where tenants move out and move in all the time.  The low rates of vacant units of 1-2% recorded in 2016 is a strong indication that the local authorities, through the additional provision of funding provided by my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Social Housing Programme, have substantially addressed the back log that had accumulated pre-2014.  This programme is in addition to the routine turnaround of vacant social housing stock which is a matter for each local authority under their on-going maintenance programmes.</p><p>Statistics on the average re-letting times for local authority social housing are set out in the report of the National Oversight and Audit Commission on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities, the last published report being for 2014, which is available at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>This does not capture information on the average refurbishment time taken by local authorities.  Feedback from local authorities is that the time taken by them to turn around vacant social houses can vary from property to property, depending on the level of refurbishment required in each individual case.  Delays may also result when offers of accommodation are turned down by prospective tenants. </p></reply>

The results of the survey indicated that there were 17,434 hectares of residential zoned lands nationally which is sufficient to support the construction of over 414,000 dwellings.  This quantum of zoned land is considered to be more than sufficient to meet the annual new housing provision requirement of 25,000 homes and to provide for choice in the marketplace for development sites over the next decade or so.  My Department&rsquo;s<i>www.myplan.ie </i>web browser contains a detailed map of the residential land availability study which the Deputy and any other member of the public may consult, free of charge.  A further Residential Land Availability Survey will be undertaken in 2017.</p><p>In relation to housing in the Dublin Region specifically, where housing demand is particularly acute, the Government published Construction 2020 <b>&ndash; </b>A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector (May, 2014) which included a commitment to establishing a Housing Supply Coordination Taskforce for Dublin with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues (Action 2 of the Strategy).  This Task Force was convened by my Department and includes representatives of the four Dublin local authorities.  Recent data from the Task Force concluded that across the four Dublin authorities there is land immediately available with planning permission for development of approximately 27,000 housing units and a further tranche of lands that could accommodate a further 20,000 new homes or so, if the owners of such lands sought planning permission to do so.</p><p>In relation to Kildare, as the Deputy will be aware, the current County Development Plan is under review and the draft development plan indicates that there is sufficient residentially zoned land to accommodate some 32,000 new dwellings in Kildare overall.  The Draft Plan also addresses the degree to which further lands are required to achieve the housing allocation within the metropolitan area of the county under the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area and which will be further elaborated upon within the subsequent Local Area Plan process, in accordance with relevant statutory guidelines and in particular, the application of a sequential approach to the zoning of new residential lands. </p><p>In addition, the active pursuit of progressing housing developments on State lands, including local authority lands, is a major part of the new approach to housing provision under Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The Action Plan contains a number of integrated actions to underpin land supply management, including the development of a national Land Supply Management Strategy, within the context of the new National Planning Framework.  This will involve identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed-tenure housing, including social and more affordable housing.  It is also envisaged that local authorities will be supported in acquiring housing lands in key developable areas, and strategic opportunities for urban renewal and regeneration will be identified for co-ordinated action across relevant public sector bodies.</p><p>Furthermore, the Housing Agency, in consultation with my Department and local authorities, has already commenced the mapping of some 700 sites in local authority ownership and those held by the Agency under the Land Aggregation Scheme, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.  The map will be made available in due course and will be updated to record the development and use of these lands.</p><p>Taking account of the foregoing and as outlined in Pillar 3 of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness - Rebuilding Ireland, I am satisfied that local authorities have sufficient land for new housing and to ensure choice and competition for development land in the marketplace.  The principal challenge from a land supply management and housing supply perspective is to ensure a strong and steady supply of developable sites off this very considerable national land bank through a variety of active land management techniques, such as assistance in site assembly and removal of infrastructural blockages.  In line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment on this issue, the Action Plan sets out a further range of practical and readily implementable set of actions to create a functioning and sustainable housing system.</p></reply>

That is why, in publishing the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, the Government has set out a practical and readily implementable set of actions to create a functioning and sustainable housing system.  The Action Plan includes more than 80 separate actions and is very much focussed on the increased supply of affordable homes in the right locations.</p><p><b><i></i></b>Pillar 4 of the Action Plan deals with the rental sector and commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the sector in Q4 2016.  The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  In terms of supply, the strategy will focus on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply to foster greater rent stability and choice.  Moreover, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced a number of measures to address rent stability and housing supply.  The minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies was increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4-year period.</p><p>The rental market in Ireland has grown significantly in recent years and now accounts for around 20% of total Irish households.  There are no figures available, however, as to the proportion of those households who wish to purchase their own home.</p><p>The common thread running through the five Pillars of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>is a focus on increasing housing supply, in order to achieve a better supply/demand balance in the market, with consequential benefits in terms of social housing availability, moderated rents and house prices.  This focus on housing supply is shared across Government.  Any housing related taxation issues are a matter for the Minister for Finance to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

These schemes also provide a range of supports to encourage and assist people on long-term illness and disability payments to identify and take up available employment, training, educational and other self-development opportunities, where appropriate.  The objectives also make a significant contribution to the broader social inclusion goal through the provision of income support and support to work.</p>  <p>  My Department continually keeps its main disability payment schemes such as the Invalidity Pension and the Disability Allowance under review to ensure that they continue to meet these high-level objectives.</p>  <p>  It is not the function of the income support system to address the additional costs associated with a disability.  Accordingly, I have no plans to establish a cost of disability payment within the social protection system.  In any event, people with disabilities are not a homogeneous group and as such would have widely differing needs with the result that the extra costs of disability would not therefore arise to the same extent in all cases.  There is no single comprehensive payment available in respect of the additional costs of disability.  However, some of these are addressed across schemes provided by a number of agencies such as the health service and also the Revenue Commissioners through certain tax reliefs and other supports.</p>  <p>  I hope that clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The rent supplement scheme is supporting some 50,700 tenants at a cost of &euro;267 million this year.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the ongoing difficulties in the rented market, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach in assessing rent supplement where rents may exceed the maximum limits.  The Protocol arrangement in place with Threshold continues to operate in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute covering Dublin, Cork, Meath, Kildare, Wicklow and Galway City.</p>  <p>  The strategic policy direction of my Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme.  To achieve this, the Government has two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) which is in operation since 2004 and the more recent HAP scheme which has been in operation since 2014 and is a key pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020.</p>  <p>  Under HAP, responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities. HAP will contribute to the provision of a more integrated and streamlined system of social housing supports as it has been designed, unlike rent supplement, to allow any households that find full-time employment to remain in the scheme.  Officials in my Department will continue to work with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Local Authorities to support the accelerated roll out of HAP as committed to in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p>  <p>  Policy responsibility and reporting on HAP and the Affordable Rental Scheme, as outlined in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

Of these, 900 are estimated to be unaccompanied minors.  On a visit to Calais on 26th September, President Hollande announced the definitive closure of the Camp and the redistribution of its inhabitants to centres throughout France.  The President described the planned closure as a &ldquo;full and final&rdquo; dismantlement which will be completed by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  The French Government is to provide for 9,000 places in the centres throughout the country.  Migrants will be offered the chance to apply for asylum in France, and those who do not qualify will be sent home. For unaccompanied minors, there will be specific accommodation arrangements.</p>  <p>  President Hollande said that the objectives of these actions are to &ldquo;guarantee the security of the people of Calais, to maintain public order and to ensure for the migrants and refugees that conditions are dignified&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that persons who are currently in another EU Member State - including those in the camps in Calais - and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  With regard to unaccompanied minors Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.</p>  <p>  Matters relating to Asylum and Refugees in Calais are a matter for France in the first instance, acting in conformity with applicable EU agreements and processes, and I have confidence in the French authorities to manage this issue.</p>  <p>  Of course I share the concerns expressed by the Deputy in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group.</p></reply>

In so far as this is intended to compensate for the likely financial losses that whistle-blowers face because of their disclosures, our legislation has a different emphasis.  In the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, we have provided a range of robust protections against any penalisation, financial or otherwise, suffered as a result of having disclosed wrongdoing observed in the workplace.  Our approach has been to create a supportive environment to allow for disclosures of wrongdoing to be made in the public interest rather than providing financial incentives for whistle-blowing, which may lead to moral or other hazards such as, for example, malicious reporting, entrapment and conflicts of interest in court proceedings.</p>  <p>  Section 2 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 provides for the  legislation to be reviewed after three years of operation and my Department will commence such a review in 2017.  This will be a suitable opportunity to further consider the matters referred to in the Deputy's question, in particular whether direct financial incentives for whistle-blowers are appropriate in an Irish statutory context.</p></reply>

However, as a consequence of the transition of pension payrolls to the Payroll Shared Services Centre at the end of 2015, data with respect to 2016 retirements can be more readily interrogated.  Accordingly, I can tell the Deputy that the average lump sum paid to a civil servant who retired on a full pension in 2016 to date, that is, to someone who retired at or after the minimum pension age and with 40 years of service, is approximately &euro;97,000.  Such a person would be in receipt of a pension of just over &euro;32,300 per annum.  I would also point out that because many civil service pensioners retire without full service, the average civil service pension in payment is approximately &euro;24,000.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that all new entrants to the public service since 1 January 2013 will be entitled to pensions based on career average salary as opposed to the final salary schemes applicable to employments commenced before that date.  </p><p>Unfortunately, issues with the recording of historical data have also resulted in the necessity to correct material provided to the Deputy in response to PQ 27235/16 answered on 27 September, 2016.  The table is a corrected version of the table supplied in response to that question.  </p><p>The table shows the number of lump sums paid centrally to civil servants on retirement in 2013, 2014 and 2015, broken down by the bands requested by the Deputy, and the corresponding total value of lump sums paid centrally in each year.  It also shows the total value of lump sums paid to all civil servants on retirement in the year.<table><tr><th>Band</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>0- 5,000 </td><td>87</td><td>25</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>5,000-10,000 </td><td>25</td><td>80</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>10,000 - 15,000 </td><td>30</td><td>61</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>15,000-20,000 </td><td>32</td><td>55</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>20,000-25,000 </td><td>15</td><td>40</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>25,000-30,000 </td><td>18</td><td>30</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>30,000 -35,000 </td><td>9</td><td>32</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>35,000-40,000 </td><td>10</td><td>33</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>40,000- 45,000 </td><td>10</td><td>26</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>45,000-50,000 </td><td>6</td><td>33</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>50,000-55,000 </td><td>13</td><td>49</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>55,000-60,000 </td><td>7</td><td>27</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>60,000-65,000 </td><td>12</td><td>45</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>65,000-70,000 </td><td>9</td><td>39</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>70,000-75,000 </td><td>8</td><td>34</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>75,000-80,000 </td><td>12</td><td>40</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>80,000-85,000 </td><td>9</td><td>32</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>85,000-90,000 </td><td>13</td><td>38</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>90,000-95,000 </td><td>15</td><td>38</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>96,000-100,000 </td><td>3</td><td>21</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>100,000-150,000 </td><td>47</td><td>179</td><td>173</td></tr><tr><td>150,000-200,000 </td><td>8</td><td>36</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>200,000-250,000 </td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>250,000-300,000 </td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of lump sums paid by PSSC (was PMGs)</td><td>402</td><td>1,006</td><td>1,181</td></tr><tr><td>Total value of lump sums paid by PSSC (was PMGs)</td><td>&euro;18,831,179</td><td>&euro;65,901,506</td><td>&euro;71,464,015</td></tr><tr><td>Total value of lump sums paid to civil servants</td><td>&euro;43,774,896</td><td>&euro;85,984,735</td><td>&euro;80,895,256</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In their 2016 National Service Plan, the HSE's priority is to provide 1.3 million hours of personal assistance to more than 2,000 people with a disability.  This is the same activity level that was funded in 2014 and 2015.  Personal Assistant hours are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the service is at all times responsive to client's needs and that the hours available are allocated appropriately and in a timely manner.  The HSE has confirmed that in excess of &euro;30 million is spent annually on the provision of Personal Assistant Services.</p>  <p>  The HSE funds a range of assisted living services, including personal assistant services, to support individuals to live full and independent lives.  The personal assistant works on a one-to-one basis with the person with a disability both in the home and in the community.  A vital element of this personalised support is the full involvement of the individual service user in planning and agreeing the type of support and the time that support is required.  Assisted living services are provided either directly by the HSE or in partnership with a range of voluntary service providers.  </p>  <p>  Any increases in demand for personal assistant services due to demographic pressures and changing needs must be met within the level of resources available.  As the Deputy will be aware, the level of funding available for the HSE is being considered as part of the national estimates / budgetary process for 2017, which is currently underway.  Following this process, the HSE will then prepare its National Service Plan for 2017.  Pending agreement of the National Service Plan, I am not in a position to comment on service levels, including personal assistant hours, to be provided in 2017.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-05a.470.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100500085#WRS01500"><p>Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependents and every application must be assessed on that basis.  In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependents.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they may face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p><p>It should be noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying  for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  </p><p>Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 110,453 as of 1st September this year.  This followed the measures announced by my predecessor Minister Varadkar, when the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>was published.  The &quot;Keane&quot; Report found that it is not feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility.  On foot of the publication of the report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and demonstrates the HSE's commitment to the development of a medical system which is responsive and considerate  of an applicant's particular circumstances.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-05a.492.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100500086#WRT01600"><p>The Report on the Establishment of Hospital Groups notes that UHW should continue to provide invasive cardiology services for the population of the South East, in collaboration with the cardiology service in Cork.  The patient flow analysis, detailed in the report of Dr. Herity's independent clinical review, provides evidence that the cath lab in UHW is currently providing services to the population of the South East and, in particular, to residents of counties Wexford, Waterford and South Tipperary.  I am confident that implementation of Dr. Herity's report will provide improved, and safer cardiology services for the South East and will strengthen links between clinicians in UHW and Cork University Hospital.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have accepted Dr. Herity's recommendation that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified.  I have also accepted his recommendation for investment in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology service there.  This investment will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan for 2017.  During this period of investment and enhancement of services, the situation will be closely monitored.  A further independent review will be carried out in early 2017 to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending the cath lab.</p>  <p>  Before we can implement Dr. Herity recommendation that some emergency services be provided elsewhere, it will first be necessary to ensure that a number of operational processes are embedded.  I want to be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access on a 24/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017.</p>  <p>  Beyond Dr. Herity's report, I am delighted to see UHW's plans to develop the hospital as a centre for orthopaedic excellence.  I am fully committed to supporting UHW's plans in relation to this and for the centralisation of orthopaedic services for the people of the South East.  The Deputy can be assured of the Government's commitment to the development of services at UHW as evidenced by the recent approval of two new academic posts for UHW, namely Professor of Orthopaedics and Professor of Oncology.</p></reply>

In order to address the ongoing difficulties in the Dairy markets at EU and international level, the Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July 2016.  The main component of the package is a fund of &euro;500 million, which is in turn comprised of two elements. </p>  <p>  The first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure to compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg).  The detailed rules regarding this measure were agreed at EU level on August 25 and the Commission provided the legal provisions to give effect to this measure earlier this month.  The Scheme is currently being implemented in Ireland and some 4,400 milk producers have applied, indicating that they propose to reduce milk  production by 72m litres in the Oct &ndash; Dec 2016 period over the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The second element of the EU July 2016 package, to which the Deputy refers, is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes, which each Member State can use in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  Whilst eligibility criteria will apply, Member States are afforded a large degree of flexibility in terms of the  measures they might adopt.  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will  be &euro;11.09 million.  Member States will be required to notify the Commission by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted.</p>  <p>  I will consider the question of national co-funding on this latter element in the context of deliberations on budgetary matters and taking into account the pressures across the agri food sectors.</p></reply>

Nine greyhounds were exported from Ireland to that destination earlier this year.  There is no evidence to suggest that any of these greyhounds were mistreated.  However, on foot of these exports, officials of my Department met with Bord na gCon, the Irish Greyhound Board (IGB) and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum (represented by the ISPCA and the Dogs Trust) to consider all the issues surrounding the export of greyhounds.  IGB regulates the greyhound industry in the Republic of Ireland and has advised all persons involved in the export of greyhounds to only export to destinations that provide the expected levels of care and management as defined in the IGB's Code of Practice for the welfare of greyhounds.  I strongly endorse this view.</p></reply>

All aquaculture activities in Natura site areas require an Appropriate Assessment to be carried out before any aquaculture licensing determinations can be made.  My Department is working with the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to achieve full compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives through a multi-annual work programme.  This data collection programme, which is substantially complete, together with the setting of Conservation Objectives, will enable all new and renewal aquaculture applications to be assessed.</p>  <p>  Conservation Objectives have been set for Ballyness SAC.  The next step in the process is the carrying out of an Appropriate Assessment by the Marine Institute.  This is being progressed taking account of the need to facilitate the use of scientific and other resources on a flexible basis across the full range of bays.  While the Appropriate Assessments are carried out on a bay by bay basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually.</p>  <p>  Section 4 of the Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Act 1998 provides that an application for an aquaculture licence shall not be determined, if the applicant commences to engage in aquaculture at the place or waters to which the application relates before a licence is granted under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997.  My Department&rsquo;s Marine Engineering Division has confirmed that unauthorised aquaculture activity has taken place at a number of sites in Ballyness Bay, including the sites operated by the person referred to by the Deputy.   My Department has written to the persons involved in this unauthorised activity seeking to have the illegal structures removed.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the applicable legislation, my Department cannot process further the application submitted by the person referred to by the Deputy due to the unauthorised activity on the area in question.  The unauthorised aquaculture must cease and the related structures must be removed.  It would then be open to the person referred to by the Deputy to apply for an Aquaculture and Foreshore Licence to conduct aquaculture in respect of this area.</p></reply>

Since 2011, the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme has been supporting and incentivising, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) including PHEVs in Ireland.  These grants are in addition to tax incentives such as the Vehicle Registration Tax reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to EVs and Accelerated Capital Allowances (ACA) which allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying technologies including EVs, PHEVs and other hybrid vehicles.  The purchase of 1,634 new EVs has been supported since the EV Grant Scheme commenced.  Of these, 544 of these have been grant aided this year alone.  The effectiveness of all instruments continues to be kept under review.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is underway to establish a task force, as set out in the Programme for Government, involving relevant government departments, agencies, industry and representative groups, to further examine the potential for the take-up of electric and other low emission vehicles.</p></reply>

The Greenpark Meadows area of Mullingar is within the BLUE Area i.e. within the area receiving service from commercial broadband providers.  It appears from the Deputy's question that issues persist however in relation to obtaining high speed services in the area.  I have asked officials in my Department to investigate this further and if the Deputy has further detail, including the eircodes of any premises which cannot currently get services, it would be helpful if these were emailed to broadband@dccae.gov.ie. </p><p>As an update on the procurement process, over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015.  This includes almost 18,000 premises in Westmeath.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services.

This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map. </p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.

It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.

Those preliminary findings are based on the fact that Ireland's post-collision investigations since the introduction of the Garda Forensic Collision Team, compares very favourably with best practices in other countries.  Since its establishment in 2007, the Garda Forensic Collision Team closes a road following a fatal or serious injury collision, and undertakes a detailed investigation in respect of all relevant matters in relation to the collision and the location.  There are in excess of 40 Garda trained forensic collision specialists, with at least one officer based in each Garda division around the country who have been attending the scene of all fatal accidents and collisions where victims have suffered serious injuries which could result in death since 2007. </p>  <p>  I intend to finalise the review process under the Strategy Action, once the consultation process with all of the key stakeholders involved in carrying out the study has been completed, in the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-05a.635.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016100500091#WRY01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 236 to 239, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The goal of this Government is to support the creation of an additional 200,000 jobs by 2020 with 135,000 outside Dublin and to achieve sustainable full employment.  We also want to attract back 70,000 emigrants from abroad.  This is a whole of Government effort and is delivered through our integrated Action Plan for Jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs  process aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship and start-ups, regain Ireland&rsquo;s lost competitiveness and ensure the potential of the regions for development and job creation through Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Regional is fully realised, supported by competitive regional funds.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs process is working.  Over 176,800 more people are at work since the first plan was launched at the start of 2012 and unemployment has fallen to 8.3% in August 2016.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2016 commits to 50,000 additional jobs this year.  Good progress is being made with 36,000 additional at work in the first six months of the year and the rate of unemployment is now down to 7.9% for September.</p>  <p>  One of the strategic objectives of Enterprise 2025 is to create a business environment &ndash; including the tax environment &ndash; in Ireland where it is easy to start up and grow a business.  In relation to taxation policy my key focus is on stimulating increased investment in the productive sector and to ensure Ireland continues to develop its attractiveness as a location of choice for FDI.  We want to support the retention and attraction of talent and skills.  We also want to support greater levels of innovation to deliver sustainable growth.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs complements the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work which set outs actions to be taken in support of those that are currently unemployed in order to help them access the labour market and new job opportunities. In addition, we know that there is demand for a range of skills and experienced professionals across the economy.  There are opportunities for overseas talent to be attracted to Ireland, including attracting back our emigrants, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  We also know we need to be competitive for attracting international talent &ndash; including in the area of personal tax.  Recent analysis by the Irish Tax Institute shows that at lower income levels (&euro;18,000), Ireland has the lowest effective personal tax rate of ten countries examined.  However, as income levels rise, taxpayers in Ireland move quickly up the international tables.  For example, at salary levels of &euro;55,000, the effective tax rate in Ireland is about 30% compared with 28.4% in the UK, while at salary levels of &euro;75,000 the effective rate of tax paid in Ireland is 35.3% compared with 28.4% in the UK.  The OECD has noted that as highly skilled mobile workers can add significant value to an economy that there may be merit, in certain cases, in introducing tax concessions targeted at mobile high-skilled worker.  Many countries have implemented favourable tax schemes focused on attracting skilled workers, for example in Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  The DJEI submission to the Department of Finance on Tax and Entrepreneurship Review in 2015 identified the need to assess the potential for a dedicated system to allow Irish based businesses to hire key skills from abroad on an internationally competitive basis on the basis that such a system would only be appropriate where there is a key skills shortage and very limited risk of displacement.</p>  <p>  My Pre-Budget Submission is prepared based on the commitments on tax measures in the Programme for a Partnership Government agreed in May as well as detailed consultations with the enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and with Science Foundation Ireland.  My Department has also consulted with external stakeholder groups and with bodies such as the Retail Consultative Forum and the Advisory Group on Small Business.  We have also undertaken comparisons of key developments in other countries with which we compete for trade, investment and talent and have taken account of the views of bodies such as the OECD and IMF, so as to ensure we have evidence based analysis of our tax competitiveness. </p>  <p>  I submitted my proposals to the Minister for Finance at the end of June.  All proposals are being considered by the Department of Finance in terms of costs and benefits and in the context of the range of proposals received.  The Minister for Finance will decide on the balance of measures to be included in the Budget, in the context of the tight fiscal position of the country and the competing demands on scare resources. </p></reply>

Last year IDA Ireland client companies based outside of Dublin accounted for 59% (109,812 people) of total IDA Ireland client employment.  In addition, IDA Ireland remains committed to increasing investment in each region by 30-40% by the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  As part of its ongoing efforts to bring jobs to rural Ireland, the Agency supports client companies who wish to provide teleworking solutions for their employees.  I understand that, while IDA Ireland does not gather specific data on teleworking practices in private companies, a number of its clients employ people on a home working basis.  </p>  <p>  The decision to facilitate working from home is an operational matter for an individual company.  However, this decision is clearly dependent on the availability of adequate telecommunications facilities including broadband.</p>  <p>  The availability of these facilities has been identified as extremely important to multinationals when it comes to choosing where to locate.  That is partly why the Delivery of National Broadband Plan, which will accelerate and prioritise the rollout of broadband in rural areas, is a top priority for Government, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government. </p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2016, funding of &euro;51m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. </p>  <p>  From within this budget, my Department provides &euro;18.9m in funding to projects under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.

My Department also provides funding to 21 projects under the Local Drug Task Force (LDTF) Scheme amounting to &euro;1.18m.  The projects provide a range of supports for young people by way of targeted drug prevention and awareness.  This funding is administered mostly by the network of Education and Training Boards.</p>  <p>   Services who seek funding from my Department must submit an annual renewal application for funding and an annual progress report in which they detail the target cohort of young people for their services, the programmes that are provided, their objectives for young people and the overall number of young people that have participated in services.

The recruitment, employment and deployment of staff including youth workers are matters for the youth organisations and services themselves.  Information about the number of youth workers employed by youth organisations and services by county is not readily available to my Department.</p></reply>

In the period since his retirement, Mr. de R&oacute;iste has continued to assert that the reasons for his retirement from the service were never made clear to him.   </p>  <p>  Following on from a full debate on 10 March 2010, Seanad &Eacute;ireann adopted a resolution which included a provision that the Government would ask the Judge Advocate General to select a nominee to carry out a review of the documentation on Mr. de R&oacute;iste&rsquo;s file to determine whether, on the basis of the documentation available to the Defence Forces at the time of the decision to compulsorily retire him, that decision was a reasonable one. </p>  <p>  Following advice from the Attorney General, the then Minister for Defence twice wrote to Mr. de R&oacute;iste, via his solicitors, indicating that he proposed to establish the review on the basis of the Seanad motion and enclosing a copy of the proposed Terms of Reference.  His solicitors replied indicating that they were concerned by what they termed the restricted nature of the draft Terms of Reference.   </p>  <p>  In 2015 following a review of the file, the Department sought further advice from the Attorney General.  Based on the advice of the Attorney General, the Terms of Reference of the original review were revised.  The then Minister for Defence, Mr. Simon Coveney, T.D., contacted Mr. de Roiste&rsquo;s solicitors in this regard, who have not accepted the revised Terms of Reference. </p>  <p>  The Private Secretary of Minister Paul Kehoe, T.D., wrote to Mr. de R&oacute;iste on 22 July 2016, requesting that he reply, through his Solicitors, within 21 days with a view to reaching agreement on this matter.  In the absence of agreement on the proposed Terms of Reference, it is not practical to advance the matter any further.</p></reply>
