The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as soon as possible. This piece of important legislation provides for the subsuming of functions from three separate agencies; namely the HSE, and also the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board which both currently come under the remit of my Department. The preparations undertaken to date include identification of the first Chair of the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  In preparation for the formal establishment of the new Agency Ms. Norah Gibbons will be initially appointed as Chair of the existing Family Support Agency, one of the constituent bodies to be merged into the Child and Family Agency.  In line with the practice established by this Government Ms. Gibbons will be available to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in advance of her taking up her position.  </p><p>  A public advertisement has been undertaken through the Public Appointments Service seeking Expressions of Interest from those interested in being appointed to the Board of the Family Support Agency having regard to both its existing statutory functions and its planned role in facilitating the establishment of the Child and Family Agency. The closing date for applications is Thursday, 23rd May 2013.  </p><p>  The selection of board members will reflect the enhanced role being given to this board in overseeing, on an administrative basis, the governance and organisational preparations for the new Agency. The number of Board members appointed will be in line with Section 10 (1) of the Family Support Agency Act, 2001, which provides for a board of 12 members in total.</p><p>  Those appointed to the FSA Board will have a term of office up to the date of the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency.  In the interests of good governance I anticipate that in general a good level of continuity will be maintained between the newly appointed Family Support Agency Board and the Board of the Child and Family Agency, although I will be proposing that the latter board be smaller in number.</p><p>  Meanwhile legislative preparations are advanced with finalisation of the Child and Family Agency Bill nearing completion in conjunction with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I expect to introduce this Bill to the House in this session.</p></reply>

These reports are published on the HSE website. The latest published report shows that there were 323 children in general residential care in February 2013, 291 (90%) of whom had a written care plan. All children in Special Care or in High Support placement had a written care plan. There were 4,031 children in general foster care in February 2013, of whom 3,581 (89%) children had a written care plan.   A care plan should be developed in advance of a child going into care, except where the child enters care on an emergency basis.</p><p>  The Child Care Regulations 1995 require that all children in care have a Care Plan and that the Care Plan is reviewed at regular intervals or when required. The HSE has advised me that day to day exigencies of service provision, such as staff absence due to annual, maternity and sick leave, can impact on services. The HSE further advised that there may be circumstances in which local decisions are made in regard to work planning within the context of service priorities, such as child protection workloads within an area or staff availability. In these circumstances, it may be determined that a &lsquo;child in care review&rsquo; can be deferred for a short period. Such a decision will be made on the basis of risk assessment and would apply to particularly stable care placements. </p><p>  The figures for children in general residential care of 90% and general foster care of 89% respectively at the end of February 2013 shows an improvement on the figures at February 2011 where the comparative figures were 87% and 88%. </p><p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in relation to the recruitment of social workers, the HSE has advised me that as of 15th April, there are currently 123 vacant posts being filled. These posts will improve resources available to support children in care across the country.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-09a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013050900048#WRB00400"><p>The recent publication of a further seven reviews, conducted by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church into safeguarding practices at both diocesan and Religious Congregation level, is a further important step in presenting a national picture of how both are engaging with the issue of child protection, and the regimes in place to ensure that proper safeguarding arrangements are being applied and, more importantly, complied with.</p><p>  The review process is an important element within an overall programme of work which needs to be completed in order to provide the necessary assurances to the public, and to the statutory authorities, that appropriate safeguarding and reporting measures are in place and operating well across the Catholic Church.</p><p>  Sixteen diocesan reviews have now been published, together with four reviews of Religious Congregations.  I look forward to the publication of all remaining reviews and expect that the Church authorities will engage with the Safeguarding Board in order to complete the national review process.</p><p>  The recently-published reviews reveal evidence of good and improved practice in the development of better safeguarding structures and processes.  This is to be welcomed.  Positive developments are shown in terms of adherence to the standards set out by the Safeguarding Board.  There is also evidence of a very constructive engagement with diocesan Safeguarding Committees.  It is also encouraging that the Board reported that all the findings of the reviews have been fully accepted and that the recommendations are already being implemented.  However, there is no room for complacency, and it is imperative that the standards are fully implemented across the Church and that this continues to be validated by the Safeguarding Board. </p><p>  From the perspective of historic allegations, the diocese of Clogher came in for particular criticism on this occasion, having exhibited very poor practice when it came to responding to allegations of abuse.  In response to publication of that diocesan review, the Church authorities acknowledged that much more could have been done to intervene to ensure the safety of children was held paramount.</p><p>  The review reports were furnished by the Safeguarding Board to the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I will be consulting with Mr. Gordon Jeyes, CEO-designate of the new Child and Family Agency, who works closely with the Safeguarding Board and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, on the findings of the reviews and on the ongoing collaborative work being done to promote improved safeguarding practices across the Catholic Church.</p><p>  I would also like to highlight the enormous contribution which Mr. Ian Elliot, Chief Executive of the Safeguarding Board has made to the development of more effective and transparent child protection practices in the Catholic Church.  Mr. Elliot has overseen an objective and consistent methodology for all reviews and I look forward to this work being continued to the same standard by his successor.</p></reply>

My Department has been assured by the Department of Health that, in view of the potential adverse health effects on children's health and well being in later life resulting from sunbed use, the forthcoming sunbeds legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Health proposes to prohibit the use of sunbeds by persons under the age of 18 in commercial sunbed premises. My Department will examine the draft legislation prior to submission to Government and I look forward to supporting my colleague, the Minister for Health, in its advancement.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-09a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013050900048#WRB00800"><p>Nearly all pre-school services in the State are now participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and which provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children before they commence primary school. </p><p>  The minimum qualification requirements have, in fact, been increased for those delivering the ECCE programme.  During the 2010-2012 period, there was an interim qualifying period whereby a person who did not hold a recognised qualification at the equivalent of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ) but could demonstrate that he/she had a certified award relevant to early childhood care and education that included significant content covering the core knowledge areas of child development, early learning, health and welfare, and provided they had at least 2 years experience of working in a position of responsibility, was able to work as a pre-school leader.  For the 2012-2014 period, every early years practitioner working as a pre-school leader entering into contract for the first time, must hold a major award at a minimum of Level 5.  To assist  unqualified practitioners in the current workforce  to achieve the full Level 5 award, my Department provided part-subsidies for an on-line course which was developed by one of the voluntary childcare organisations.</p><p>  A higher capitation rate is available to services participating in the ECCE programme in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme i.e. where all the Pre-school Leaders hold a Bachelor degree in childhood/early education and all the Pre-school Assistants hold a relevant major award at level 5. </p><p>  It is  my objective to incrementally develop the ECCE programme over the term of this Government as resources permit.  A key element of this is the implementation of the Workforce Development Plan by the Early Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located in my Department.  </p><p>  The Workforce Development Plan identified different distinct groups including new entrants to the workforce who wish to become appropriately qualified for specific occupational roles and responsibilities, and unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who want to achieve the Level 5 award.  For new entrants to the workforce the publication of Common Award Standards at Levels 4, 5 and 6 is a welcome development.  Programmes of learning developed to meet these new award standards will incorporate national practice frameworks and will reflect national policy objectives, thereby ensuring that graduates are fully prepared to enter the workforce.  Training providers have begun to meet the new award standards in respect of the FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education.  The first programme has been developed and is being provided through the VECs.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years and education, including workforce development, are being considered in the context of the National Early Years Strategy for children aged from birth to six years, which is being developed by my Department and expected to be completed later this year.</p></reply>

The approach I am taking in developing  the Strategy has received Government approval.  My intention is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland's early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.  </p><p>  A broad range of issues relating to regulations, standards, quality assurance, and inspection are currently being considered by the Expert Advisory Group which is advising my Department on the Strategy.  As Minister I am committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum. The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and I an determined that this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.</p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.  At present pre-school services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.  </p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee established under my Department, provide guidance to childminders in regard to the Regulations and good practice in the provision of childcare services.  In that context, the City and County Childcare Committees, which assist my Department in implementing its early childhood care and education programmes, encourage childminders to voluntarily notify themselves to their local Committee.  </p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  My Department will continue to adopt a pro-active approach to promoting the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including childminders, given their importance in this crucial phase of children's lives.</p></reply>

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities.  This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.</p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.  The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.</p><p>  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.</p><p>  The new After-school Childcare programme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention and the Childcare Education and Training Support  programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.  In 2013, my Department expects to spend in the region of &euro;70 million on these programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.</p><p>  Any proposed additional funding for childcare or other related services by way of re-allocation of resources currently part of the child benefit budget would be a matter for Government to consider in the context of Budget 2014. </p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>The savings required under the Government's Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m.  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>In 2013, youth funding amounting to almost &euro;1.5 million has been allocated to services in the Clondalkin and Lucan area.  This includes:</p><p><b>Youth Affairs Funding 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Special Projects for Youth</th><th><div>&euro;363,219</div></th></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities Services Fund 1</td><td><div>&euro;479,965</div></td></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities Services Fund 2</td><td><div>&euro;666,373</div></td></tr><tr><td>Youth Information Centre</td><td><div>&euro;49,001</div></td></tr><tr><td>Traveller Development</td><td><div>&euro;33,545</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The funding allocated for the provision of youth services in Co. Dublin including the Lucan and Clondalkin areas is administered by Co. Dublin VEC on behalf of my Department.  I understand that Co. Dublin VEC has consulted with the projects in the Clondalkin/Lucan area and assured them of their continued support for the projects in managing the resources available in the most effective and efficient way.</p><p>In addition, Co. Dublin VEC disperses small grant support, funded by my Department, to local voluntary youth clubs in the Lucan &amp;amp; Clondalkin areas.  The Deputy should note that under the Comprehensive Review of expenditure, I have ensured that there has been no cut to the total national funding being provided by my Department to support the local voluntary youth club grant schemes as this funding plays an important role in supporting volunteer-led youth groups and in promoting and leveraging valuable voluntary activity in youth work.</p><p>My Department administers a range of measures to support vulnerable young people and it works closely with the youth sector, the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Social Protection, Justice and Equality on shared policy objectives to promote healthy behaviours among young people, prevent early school leaving and to promote positive outcomes for them.  These measures include the <i>National Youth Health Programme</i>  which provides a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  These youth services are often first point of contact for young people and can be important reference points for them in matters to do with care, health and welfare.  My Department provides funding under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, for the Late Night League Programme which supports soccer leagues at various locations across Dublin to encourage young people to become involved in local activities thus reducing anti-social behaviour involving young people in selected areas.  The programme focuses on young people aged 13-21, promotes healthy lifestyles and takes place in disadvantaged areas during prime anti-social hours such as Friday nights.  The initiative uses football as a tool for social inclusion and learning and has proved to be very successful in communities.</p><p>The National Educational Welfare Board, under my Department, provides a range of measures to promote attendance at school and to support families where children are experiencing difficulty in attending school.  Over &euro;26m has been provided nationally in 2013 for the School Completion Programme, which is administered by my Department and operates as a key support within the Department of Education and Skills DEIS action plan.  Four local school completion projects are funded in the Clondalkin Lucan area with over &euro;1m being invested in 2013 to support students attending the 22 schools participating in theses programmes.</p><p>My colleague Minister Shatter has overall responsibility in the area of crime and anti-social behaviour and his Department funds a range of youth services, in particular Garda Youth Diversion Projects and Young Person Probation Projects, in areas of greatest need with a specific youth crime intervention approach, targeting those involved in or at risk of offending behaviour through early intervention work.  These services are linking with other youth services provided by my Department to support effective crime prevention approaches.</p><p>The new youth policy framework which my Department is developing for completion later this year will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and it will, inter alia,  promote co-ordination between government departments and the youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-09a.39.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013050900049#WRC00300"><p>Young people who leave State care are entitled to advice, guidance and practical support. This is delivered in partnership with the young person,  his or her family, carers, social workers, key or link worker and other statutory, community and voluntary agencies. Before a young person leaves care, a needs assessment is carried out to identify a young person's need for accommodation, financial support, social networks, training and education. The most vulnerable group of children are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements. Children who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers, helpful for good outcomes.</p><p>  One of the key features of aftercare is a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with the young person, and advocate on their behalf to promote their safety and development. Many young people continue to reside with foster carers while attending third level education. Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are helped to find accommodation in either supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education. </p><p>  The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years and up to 21 years which can extend until the completion of a course of education in which he/she is engaged up to the age of 23 years of age.  </p><p>  Ideally, aftercare provides the range and continuum of services to  assist the varying needs of  young people leaving care to help them  achieve a successful transition from the care environment to independent adult life in the community.  This transitionary period may present serious challenges to young people and HSE staff alike, as these young adults encounter all the usual developmental issues of leaving home without, for many, the security of a stable background.   </p><p>  Some young people, on leaving care, declare themselves independent of state services and are reluctant to engage with the service. This presents challenges to service providers but is not a reason to cut off a young person from receiving support within the timeframes of the aftercare service. The HSE policy provides that these young people can re-engage with the service at any time until they reach 21 years of age.</p><p>  Given the particular difficulties for some young people leaving care in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension. The HSE's Aftercare  Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services  Primary Care in the HSE and the Department of the Environment regarding housing  to support this approach A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I am currently examining options to strengthen legislation regarding the provision of aftercare. I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments and this remains my focus.</p></reply>

Cases referred to the Panel include:</p><p>- All deaths of children in care, including deaths by natural causes</p><p>- All deaths of children known to HSE child protection system</p><p>- Deaths of young adults (up to 21 years of age) who were in the care of the HSE in the period immediately prior to their 18th birthday or were in receipt of aftercare services</p><p>- Where a case of suspected or confirmed abuse involves the death of, or a serious incident to, a child known to the HSE or a HSE funded service</p><p>- Serious incidents involving children in care or children known to the HSE child protection services</p><p><b>NRP Notifications 2012</b></p><p>Table 1: Cause of Death</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Cause of Death</b></th><th><div><b>No.</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Drug Overdose</td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Natural Causes</td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Suicide</td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Homicide</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Road Traffic Accident</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other Accidental</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div><b>23</b></div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>NRP Notifications 2011</b></p><p>Table 2: Cause of Death</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Cause of Death</b></th><th><div><b>No.</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Drug Overdose</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Natural Causes</td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td>Suicide</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Homicide</td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Road Traffic Accident</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other Accidental</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Of the referrals in both 2011 and 2012 of children who were in the care of the State, there were two deaths in each year. All four of these children had terminal illnesses before they entered State care and were not expected to survive. The referrals of suicide cases in 2011(which include aftercare cases up to age 21)  represent 20% of the total number of referrals to the panel in that year and 39% for 2012. There are not directly comparable data readily available for the general youth population. However, in the general youth population deaths by suicide accounted for 22% of all deaths of children aged 10-17 in 2011 (State of the Nations Children Report, 2012). The figures for the general youth population deaths by suicide in 2012 are not yet available.   </p><p>While the figures above highlight an increase in suicide cases referred to the National Review Panel  between these two years this cannot be considered a trend owing to the very small amount of data available and the short reference period. In this regard, the Report of the Independent Child Death Review Group stated, inter alia, that '<i>while not seeking to minimise the gravity of the issue of deaths of children in care, in statistical terms the numbers will be small. Therefore any generalisation based on these numbers, or even comparisons with the general population is likely to be unreliable'</i>  .  However this is an issue which will be monitored closely in the future. Further, the Chair of the National Review panel has recently highlighted the increased prevalence of suicide in the cases referred in 2012. In this regard there are plans to provide specialist training in the area to Review Panel members to assist in better understanding the underlying issues. The NRP also intends to produce themed reports in the future which will focus on areas such as this.</p><p>As regards the broader issue raised by the Deputy, my Department supports a range of community based programmes for all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  The training is based on the resource 'Mindout' which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway.   Mindout adopts a universal mental health promotion approach which has strong links with the &quot;Support for all&quot; element of the recent guidelines on Mental Health Promotion for Schools published by the HSE, Department of Education and Skills and the National Office for Suicide Prevention. In addition, the HSE is working proactively to ensure that front line staff are receiving training and receive continuing professional development with regard to suicide awareness and the promotion of positive mental health for young people.</p></reply>

With the rapid evolution of internet technology, through internet on mobile phones and camera phones, parents need to understand that access to the internet is becoming increasingly diverse and therefore increasingly difficult to supervise.</p><p>The Office for Internet Safety (OIS) which was established in March 2008 as an Executive Office of the Department of Justice and Equality has primary responsibility for the development and promotion of strategic actions to promote the highest possible levels of internet safety, particularly in relation to combating child pornography. The Office for Internet Safety plays a key role in ensuring a cohesive approach is being taken across Government Departments, State Agencies and other key stakeholders in addressing illegal content   on the internet.</p><p>The OIS has established a service accessible at www.hotline.ie   where people can report sites if they have concerns that content may be illegal. All reports received are assessed and where content is found to be illegal action is taken. This is an anonymous service and you do not have to give your name or any personal information.</p><p>  The Safer Internet Ireland Project is a consortium of industry, education, child welfare and government partners that acts as a Safer Internet Centre in Ireland providing awareness, hotline and helpline functions and activities in the Republic of Ireland. The project, coordinated by the OIS aims to develop national initiatives promoting the safer use of electronic media and enhance protection of the vulnerable, particularly children, against the downside of the Internet. The project develops materials and programmes of awareness to ensure that children, teachers and parents understand the benefits and risks of the Internet. </p><p>The National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), has primary responsibility for the development of material and programmes of awareness to ensure children, teachers and parents understand the benefits and risks of the internet, through initiatives such as www.webwise.ie  </p><p>  There are some simple practical steps parents can take to help limit the risks as well as clear advice they can give their children. The best way of doing this is for parents to get involved and understand how their children use the internet. Developing your knowledge of the technology involved and understanding how your child uses this technology to interact with others on the Internet will greatly assist parents in guiding and supporting their children to ensure that they are using it in the safest possible manner.</p></reply>

High Support differs from ordinary residential care in that the units offer higher staff ratios, on-site education as well as specialised input such as psychology services. </p><p>  High support units aim to assist young people in developing internal controls of behaviour, to enhance self-esteem, facilitate personal abilities and strengths, and to build a capacity for constructive choice, resilience and responsibility.

RIA is charged with providing accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers, that is, adults and their children, under the Direct Provision system while their applications for asylum are processed.  I am advised that Direct Provision centres are monitored three times a year, twice by Department of Justice staff and once by an external company.  </p><p>  The revised Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children was published in July, 2011. The Guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child welfare and safety concerns.  It sets out a number of key messages relating to the duty to protect children and support their welfare.  The scope of Children First extends beyond the reporting of suspected neglect,  abuse and welfare concerns.  It emphasises the importance of multi disciplinary, inter-agency working in the management of such concerns.  Key to this is the sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children and the need for full co-operation to ensure better outcomes. </p><p>  The HSE has advised me that concerns about the welfare, safety or wellbeing of a child in Direct Provision are reported to the HSE Children and Family Services, in line with Children First. Referrals include welfare concerns such as a parent being hospitalised, parental illness, a child being left unsupervised by an adult or mental health concerns regarding the parent, while a smaller number would relate to child protection concerns.  </p><p>  There is a specific unit within RIA -the Child and Family Services Unit - whose role is to manage, deliver, co-ordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system. This unit also links, where necessary, directly with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I have had ongoing contact with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and that senior officials within my Department have engaged with the HSE, to ensure that children who residing in Direct Provision are afforded the same levels of welfare and protection that their counterparts in the wider community are afforded. </p></reply>

The programme includes a number of additional provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis, for example availing of the programme for two days a week in the first year and for three days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.  It is my view that it would be extremely helpful to many children, and particularly those children with special needs, if a second pre-school year were to be provided.  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding and this funding is not available because of the financial constraints under which the Government is currently operating.</p><p>  The ECCE programme will continue to be evaluated and developed as resources permit.  My Department has been actively working with the Department of Health, specifically the Office of Disability and Mental Health, in the context of building better supports to facilitate the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream pre-school settings.  I was successful in securing capital funding in Budget 2013 to support the ongoing improvement of the childcare sector.  The funding programme (applications for which closed on 30 April 2013) will provide grants under four strands, one of which is specifically for grants to improve the accessibility of services for children with disabilities.</p></reply>

The administrative arrangement is the first international arrangement for intercountry adoption entered into by the AAI and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since both countries ratified the Hague Convention.  The Adoption Authority accredited Helping Hands for activities in relation to facilitating adoptions from Vietnam and Helping Hands has recently received confirmation from the Vietnamese authorities of its approval to operate there.  I met recently with representatives of Helping Hands who informed me that they expect adoptions to commence shortly.  In March I lead a delegation to India which included the Chair of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and a departmental official.  The visit, which was in conjunction with representing the Irish Government at official functions in India for St Patrick's Day, afforded me the opportunity to assess the position in relation to intercountry adoption in India and to clarify issues in relation to the requirements of the Indian authorities in that regard.  I was advised that registration is now open with CARA (the Indian Central Authority) for special needs cases; this includes children with intellectual or physical disabilities, siblings including twins, and children over five years of age.  It was explained that Indian currently operates intercountry adoption with other Hague countries without the need for any specific administrative arrangements of the type in place with Vietnam.</p><p>  I have also travelled to Moscow, accompanied by Dr Geoffrey Shannon, Chair of the Adoption Authority, in order to discuss at a diplomatic level issues in relation to the potential for a bilateral agreement with Russia.  During my visit I met with my counterpart, Minister Dmitry Livanov, Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation.  This meeting was productive and allowed for an exchange of views on the possibility of Ireland entering into a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption with Russia.  Russia and Ethiopia are not signatories of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  In these circumstances, future adoptions from Russia and Ethiopia would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and these countries.  The Russian authorities acknowledged the satisfactory outcomes for Russian children adopted in Ireland and expressed a willingness to conclude an agreement with Ireland which would be subject to the approval of the Russian parliament.  My Department, in consultation with the AAI, is continuing efforts to draft wording of a bilateral agreement,  including in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, which would satisfy our legal and Constitutional requirements, in particular in relation to the Russian requirement for post adoption reports.  The wording of the draft bilateral agreement will be a matter of consideration by the Attorney General's office  in advance of any further discussions with the Russian authorities.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April last year was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement. The Authority is examining the compatibility of  the Irish and Ethiopian adoption legislation.</p></reply>

These reports are published on the HSE website. The latest published report shows that there were 6,397 children in the care of the HSE in February 2013, of which 5,837 (91.2%) children had an allocated social worker.  It is important to note the dynamic nature of children entering and leaving care.  The HSE Review of Adequacy for HSE Children and Families Services 2011 showed that 36.7% of children admitted to care during 2011 were also discharged within the year.  The Review also showed that there were over 2000 admissions to care in each of the years, 2009 to 2011.  The HSE advise that where there are immediate operational difficulties in assigning one social worker to a child, social workers are assigned based on a needs assessment and prioritisation.  Some of these cases can relate to children in very stable fostering placements, provided perhaps, by a relative.  Where a social worker is not assigned for a period, practice has been to support foster placements through the regular social work duty system  where the child can contact the social worker on duty.  It is also important to note that cases are subject to ongoing review and, where appropriate, the level and nature of the support being provided to foster carers and children in care will change depending on the needs of the child.</p></reply>

The initiative is expected to receive annual funding of &euro;14 million to provide in the region of 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school, in order to support parents in taking up employment.  Preparations are well-advanced for the introduction of a pilot project in a small number of locations, with the national roll-out of the programme planned for September this year.  In addition to the new School Age Childcare Programme, my Department provides funding for three other childcare programmes which provide a range of supports to parents of pre-school and after-school children.  The Early Childhood Care and Education programme provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  The Community Childcare Subvention programme, which is provided through community-based childcare services, enables those services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  The Childcare Education and Training Support programme provides subvention for childcare places to qualifying trainees and students availing of certain F&Aacute;S and VEC courses.  My Department provides in the region of &euro;260 million annually to support parents with the cost of childcare under these programmes.</p><p>  Capital funding grants were made available to child-care providers, both community and commercial, during the years 2000 to 2008 for the development and refurbishment of child-care facilities.  Approximately &euro;425 million was invested during this period.  In Budget 2012, &euro;6 million was provided for remedial, maintenance and renovation work in established child-care facilities, and to assist these facilities to purchase equipment for early education and child-care services.  In Budget 2013, a further &euro;2.75 million has been allocated to support the ongoing improvement of the childcare sector.  My Department is currently developing an Early Years Strategy which will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life.  The Strategy will bring together and consider a significant amount of international and domestic research on the importance of early years for child development, including findings from the "Growing Up in Ireland" study.  It will also be informed by the evaluations of the Prevention and Early Intervention Projects which have been funded jointly by my Department and philanthropic organisations, as well as an analysis of existing service provision and associated resources.</p><p>  I am satisfied that prior and ongoing investment by my Department in the area of childcare will ensure the availability of high quality care and education for children into the future.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that, where appropriate, representative bodies and organisations working with children and young people play a role in the formation of policy.  A number of committees and advisory groups are currently in place under my Department.  One of these is the National Children's Advisory Council, which acts in an independent advisory role to myself as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and includes representatives of statutory agencies, the voluntary sector, research community, parents and young people.  Its overarching role is to contribute to the development of a strong collaborative interface between statutory and non-statutory providers of children&rsquo;s services in order to improve outcomes for children and young people.  The Council is currently assisting my Department in developing a new National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2013-2018, which will build on Our Children - Their Lives, Ireland's first children&rsquo;s strategy which was published in 2000 and provide a continuum of the life-course from infancy through to early and middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.  Key areas which I expect the Framework will identify include health and well being; education; economic security and poverty; parenting and family support; environment; safety; sports and recreation; and media, arts and culture.the National Policy Framework.  Other committees include the National Youth Work Advisory Committee which includes representatives from both the voluntary and statutory sectors with an interest and involvement in the administration and provision of youth work programmes and services.  Its main role is to advise on and assist in the co-ordination of youth work policies, programmes and services and provide a forum to address and progress specific issues.  The National Children's Strategy Implementation Group includes representatives of relevant Government departments, the Health Service Executive (HSE), local authorities, the education sector and other key agencies.  Its key priority is to ensure the implementation of all strategic plans and policy documents in relation to children's services in Ireland and improve the way in which Government, agencies and organisations work with each other.</p></reply>

My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries.  The proposed legislation is intended to provide for a structured and regulated approach for applicants seeking access to adoption information and is also intended to facilitate contact between parties affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected.  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information to identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the Bill is to provide that either the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records.  The HSE have already commenced the take over of files.  In late 2011 the HSE Adoption Services took responsibility for the adoption files of the Sacred Heart Adoption Society in respect of homes in Bessborough, County Cork; St Peters, Castlepollard, County Westmeath and Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, County Tipperary.  These files have since been transferred to the HSE in their entirety and are stored in specialised facilities in Glanmire County Cork.  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis and that a National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines to be set out in regulations.</p><p>  Complex legal and Constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill  including the setting of criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy.  These issues are currently receiving careful examination and detailed consideration is underway on the part of my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of Bill before Government at the earliest possible date.  Again, my view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as permissible within Constitutional boundaries.  However, there are undoubtedly challenges remaining in developing a workable framework which respects the Constitutional rights of all parties.  I remain committed to achieving my policy objectives notwithstanding these challenges.</p></reply>

I have met with individuals who have found themselves in these circumstance and I acknowledge and empathise with the dilemma that these individuals are addressing.  Efforts have been made by the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the HSE, within their legal remit, to facilitate the investigations that these individuals are undertaking in endeavouring to establish medical and/or identifying information about themselves.  Further efforts are required to move beyond that and endeavour to trace birth parents, children and or siblings who are affected by this issue.</p><p>  In consultation with the AAI and the HSE, my Department is examining legislative and administrative options in relation to accessing records which may exist. I am also examining provisions in this regard in the forthcoming Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  I have recently received further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in regard to complex legal and constitutional issues which have arisen during the course of drafting the Heads of Bill. These issues are currently under consideration in my Department. </p><p>  When the former Adoption Board launched the National Adoption Contact Preference Register in 2005, provision was made for persons, who were party to the illegal registration of a child, to register an interest in the Register for possible future contact with another party sometime in the future. Fundamental to the success of the NCPR is that any persons with information in this regard contact the Information and Tracing Unit of the AAI.  The Adoption Act 1952 provided a legal basis for adoption in Ireland and for the establishment of the Adoption Board thereby bringing order to what had been the ad hoc arrangements which had previously existed in lieu of formal adoption procedures. That Act was replaced by the Adoption Act 2010. All adoptions in Ireland since 1952 have been carried out in line with this legislation.</p></reply>

The National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives 2011-2016 sets out a comprehensive action plan for research and data on children&rsquo;s lives in Ireland and proposes a systematic, harmonised and coordinated approach across departments and agencies to achieve a better understanding of the factors influencing children&rsquo;s lives. </p><p>  There is a growing body of national and international evidence on the prevalence of bullying and its impact on our children and young people, on their confidence, learning outcomes, self-esteem and mental health. Two national surveys, which are Government funded, give us a national picture of the extent of bullying among children in Ireland.</p><p>  The first, Growing Up in Ireland, the National Longitudinal Study of Children, which is funded through my Department, provides us with data on the proportion of nine-year olds who have been victims of bullying (40%) and with verbal bullying emerging as the most common form of bullying, followed by exclusion and physical bullying. Boys were more likely to have experienced physical and verbal bullying, while girls were more likely to have experienced exclusion. There was little difference in the proportion of boys and girls who were bullied through written messages and electronic means and these forms of bullying occurred much less frequently than the other forms in this age cohort. There was a clear overlap between children who had bullied another and children who had been victimised &ndash; these children are classified as bully victims and constituted 10% of nine-year-olds.</p><p>  The second national survey, the Heath Behaviour of School Aged Children (HBSC) survey, also provides us with important data on this issue. Since 1998, the HBSC survey, which is conducted every four years, provided us with trends in the proportion of children between the ages of 9 and 17 who report that they were bullied at school. Given that this is part of an international study, we can also compare rates of bullying in Ireland with rates of bullying in other countries. The latest international comparisons revealed that rates of bullying in Ireland were lower than the HBSC average (27.3% versus 29.2%). Statistically significant differences were observed across age and gender, with a higher percentage of younger children and boys reporting that they were bullied at school in the past couple of months.</p><p>  Internationally, a recent EU study to examine the safety of children on the internet found that 4% of children between the ages of 9 and 16 in Ireland experienced online bullying compared with an EU average of 6%. This finding is also supported by the "Growing up in Ireland" research which showed that 5% of 9 year olds experienced cyber-bullying.  However, UNICEF&rsquo;s recently published &ldquo;Child Well being in Rich countries&rdquo; (Report Card 11) highlighted a rise in bullying among Irish young people; the report stated that 28% of children in Ireland aged 11, 13 and 15 reported &ldquo;being bullied at school at least once in the past couple of months.&rdquo;  These reports, which are available in full online, are indicative of the wealth of research on Irish children&rsquo;s lives and experiences now accessible to Irish policy-makers. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that ongoing work to implement the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, represents a significant step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to reverse these current trends. To achieve this we must work with a broad base of interests to tackle the underlying causes of bullying, including prejudice in all its forms, in a sustained manner.  The Action Plan on Bullying was produced earlier this year following detailed consideration of available evidence and research on bullying. The Working Group consulted with leading academics in the field of bullying and reviewed the current best practices in bullying prevention in other jurisdictions, to develop the series of specific evidence based actions and recommendations outlined within the Action Plan.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the actions set out in the Plan are being progressed by the relevant sectors.</p><p>  In terms of additional research, this includes new research on the prevalence and impact of bullying linked to social media on the mental health and suicidal behaviour among young people through the National Office for Suicide Prevention. The National Disability Authority has also agreed to conduct and support research on effective supports for children with special educational needs.  In addition, my Department, along with the Department of Education and Skills, has agreed to identify and initiate further research on bullying issues as our resources permit, including the monitoring and evaluation of initiatives in schools and other sectors in order to support evidence for further policy development and decision making. This will be considered in future calls for proposals under the National Children's Research Programme.</p><p>  My Department will continue to work across all sectors and services to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and the effective measures to be taken to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services. Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.  My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.</p><p>  A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this report will inform the future development of youth programmes and services.  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

It goes on to focus on strategic objectives for the EU, in particular the need to promote good governance beyond the borders of the Union and to advance the development of effective multilateralism through support for the United Nations.  It considers policy implications for the EU in light of these threats and strategic objectives.  And it concludes that the EU should become more active, more capable and more coherent.  We value also its role in widening the context in which the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operates.</p><p>  A review of the ESS was carried out in 2008 but made no fundamental changes to it.  It did, however, broaden the challenges identified to include threats such as cyber security, climate change and pandemics.  In the lead-up to the review, Ireland worked to ensure that the document remained consistent with our values and concerns.  In particular, we ensured that there was a prominent reference to the pre-eminent role of the UN in the international system and that CSDP remained situated as an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s broader Common Foreign and Security Policy.   </p><p>  In 2012 EU Foreign Ministers again looked at the possibility of revising the ESS.  It was decided, however, that an examination of particular emerging threats would be more appropriate at this time.  Following on from this, and at the initiative of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ministers have discussed a number of such issues, including energy security, water and conflict, space and security and the implications of climate change for international security.  In its current Presidency role, Ireland is working to prepare Council Conclusions in support of the ongoing development of a cybersecurity strategy for the EU. </p><p>  Debate continues about refinement of the ESS and the development of a broader foreign policy vision for the EU which goes beyond strict security concerns.  For example, four Foreign Ministers &ndash; those of Sweden, Poland, Italy and Spain &ndash; are proposing the development of a global foreign policy strategy for the EU.  This is being taken forward by four think-tanks in the EU which hope to present proposals this month for a future &ldquo;European Global Strategy&rdquo;.  Ireland is happy to play its full part in any such debates.</p></reply>

Ambassador Collins and Governor Hassan discussed a number of issues of mutual interest to Ireland and New Hampshire, focusing heavily on trade and investment. The Ambassador also extended an invitation to the Governor to visit Ireland at some point in the future.</p><p>  New Hampshire has strong historical links to Ireland, with over 280,000, or over one-fifth of the state&rsquo;s population, claiming Irish ancestry.  Such strong Diaspora connections are a tangible asset in developing Irish trade and investment links in the region. A number of Enterprise Ireland client companies have also opened offices recently in New Hampshire as an initial gateway to the United States marketplace.

It was also considered that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  In making its recommendations for exemptions and for deferrals, the group had regard to the following criteria:</p><p> - Ability to pay;</p><p> - Reliefs create costs which have to be paid for, either by taxpayers who do not benefit from the relief or by reductions in public expenditure;</p><p> - Reliefs should be designed to address clear economic and social policy needs;</p><p> - Care needs to be taken in designing relief to ensure they are targeted based on need, and there are not unintended and inequitably distributed gains;</p><p> - The LPT is intended to be a tax on the benefit from ownership of a residential property;</p><p> - Such residential properties have monetary and non-monetary values which are independent of incomes;</p><p> - And that the LPT is not assessed on incomes.</p><p>  While there are few exemptions from the charge to LPT, an exemption is available where a residential property was previously occupied by a person as his or her sole or main residence and has been vacated by the person for 12 months or more due to long term mental or physical infirmity and is not occupied by any other person.  The system of deferrals outlined in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, is targeted at cases of need, and has reference to income stressed home owners, allowing enhanced deferrals where there is low income and liability to mortgage interest.  A liability for LPT will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date, which is 1 May 2013 for the year 2013.  The LPT is a self-assessed tax and therefore liable persons are obliged to calculate the tax due based on their assessment of the market value of their property, file their return by the relevant deadline and pay the tax due.  The tax is in place for a half year in 2013 and for a full year from 2014 onwards.</p><p>  Revenue has put in place a wide range of payment options to enable liable persons to select the one that best suits their circumstances, to will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full, or to pay by instalments in various ways, including by deduction at source from certain Department of Social Protection payments.  This is intended to assist with budgeting by allowing liable persons to pay the tax in equal instalments.</p><p>  For liable persons who choose not to make an LPT Return, the Revenue Commissioners have a duty, in the interests of fairness and equity to those who are compliant, to take effective follow-up action to recover the tax from the non-compliant.  This may mean that tax clearance certificates will not be issued where there is failure to pay LPT.  I believe the vast majority of people will want to be compliant with the LPT, as they are with other taxes legislated for by the Oireachtas.  Revenue is making it as easy as possible for people to comply with their obligations to submit an LPT return and either make arrangements to pay their LPT charge or avail of a deferral of the charge if they are eligible.</p><p>  For individuals on low incomes or whose only income is from the Department of Social Protection, the LPT legislation provides for the possibility to defer the charge to LPT in certain cases where specified conditions are met.  The deferral system focuses on ability to pay the tax and is based on the income of the liable person, with increased limits where there is liability to mortgage interest.  A person who qualifies for full deferral can opt to defer 100% of the LPT liability.  A person who qualifies for partial deferral can opt to defer 50% of the liability and must pay the balance of LPT.   In all deferral cases interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of just under 4% simple interest per annum.  This is half the rate of interest that applies in cases of non-compliance with LPT and other taxes, where a daily rate of 0.0219% - just under 8% per annum &ndash; is applied to the outstanding amount from the payment date to the date the tax is paid.  The deferred amount, including the interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.</p><p>  The Government does not propose at this time to introduce a wealth tax but all taxes and potential taxation options are constantly reviewed.</p></reply>

The introduction of the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements on unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of mortgage arrears, as well as other personal debt, and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement.  It does not preclude, however, borrowers and lenders reaching bilateral agreements to address mortgage or other debt difficulty.  A number of concerns have been raised about the balance of power between banks and debtors, which has commonly been referred to as a 'Bank Veto'.  The reality is that it is in the best interest of both debtors and creditors to seek to conclude an acceptable and workable bilateral arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act, be it a Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement.  The latter such arrangement will be of particular use for those persons experiencing difficulty with repayment of their mortgages and to provide, as appropriate, for debt restructuring.  Both debtors and creditors have rights in a financial contract and these must be respected, having regard to the insolvency of the debtor.  Of course, in the event that either a Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) or Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) cannot be agreed, the ultimate resolution option is judicial bankruptcy.</p><p><b>-  Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:</b> As announced in March, the implementation of the mortgage arrears strategies has further intensified with the Central Bank now setting time bound and measurable targets for the main banks on their progress in resolving, on a durable basis, the position of their mortgage customers who are in arrears on their mortgage. The &#8220;Keane Report&#8221; has already outlined a number of possible options that can be considered by banks to provide a sustainable solution for a mortgage in difficulty on a case by case basis.  Mortgage lenders have now introduced long-term measures to assist mortgage holders in distress such as split mortgages, trade-down mortgages, negative equity mortgages and through the mortgage to rent scheme and the Central Bank will monitor the performance of banks against the targets.</p><p><b>-  Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:</b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of additional information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, www.keepingyourhome.ie, has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which is established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.</p><p><b>-  Keeping families in their homes:</b> As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option will be available to households with unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support and meet other appropriate criteria will allow the family, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.</p><p>  Overall, while progressing these particular measures, the Government is also conscious of the need to restore the economy and employment levels and its overall economic policies are directed to achieve those objectives, the successful achievement of which will be of general benefit to those with mortgages as well as the general economy.</p></reply>

The majority of funds were advanced to IBRC under a Special Master Repurchase Agreement (&ldquo;SMRA&rdquo;), involving the sale and repurchase of the c. &euro;25bn nominal value Promissory Notes and &euro;796m nominal value NAMA senior bonds.  IBRC also had a smaller amount of outstanding borrowing under the Eurosystem&rsquo;s Main Refinancing Operation secured by other assets with a nominal value of approximately &euro;370m.  In addition, &euro;3.46bn nominal value 2025 Irish Government Bonds also provided significant secured funding in a market repo (see Parliamentary Question No. 157 of 30 of April 2013 for further information regarding the Bank of Ireland repurchase agreement).  As is typical for collateralised lending arrangements, these repurchase agreements incorporated standard market terms including the requirement to provide collateral of a value in excess of the amount of lending extended under the agreement, i.e. &ldquo;excess collateral&rdquo;, whereby the collateral taken as part of the repurchase agreement is priced and subject to appropriate haircuts by the respective lenders.  </p><p>  As the Deputy is also aware, in addition to the repurchase agreements, ELA funds of approximately &euro;15bn were advanced by the Central Bank under a Facility Deed which benefitted from a Ministerial Guarantee.  The Central Bank also had security over all the ELA lending through a floating charge over the otherwise unencumbered assets of IBRC. </p><p>  Upon appointment of the Special Liquidators existing funding arrangements between IBRC and the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) were terminated.  As a result, IBRC was obligated to repurchase the collateral provided under the repurchase agreements from its lenders at prices governed by those agreements.  As IBRC was unable to repurchase this collateral with cash, the lenders retained and valued the collateral in fulfilment of IBRC&rsquo;s obligations under the agreements, with the value of collateral in excess of the borrowings being due back to IBRC.  In effect, the Promissory Notes, the NAMA Senior Bonds, the other assets and the 2025 Irish Government Bonds, held as collateral under the various repurchase agreements, were retained by the lenders in lieu of IBRC repurchasing this collateral with cash.  </p><p>  Under the terms of the various repurchase agreements, the value of the collateral in excess of the borrowed amount was applied by the lenders to reduce, or &ldquo;set off&rdquo;, the total amount outstanding under the Facility Deed.  While the values applied to individual securities held as collateral under the various repurchase agreements are commercially sensitive and so are not provided in granular detail, the combined result of these set off arrangements was to reduce the total amount outstanding under the Facility Deed from c. &euro;15bn at the time of the liquidation to &euro;12.928bn at the time it was acquired by NAMA.</p></reply>

As the purchase was carried out on the secondary market, between the Central Bank and Bank of Ireland, the transaction did not breach Article 123 of the Treaty which contains a prohibition on primary market purchases only. The Central Bank has placed the bond in a special holding along with the other government bonds received in exchange for the Promissory Notes.  While the Bank currently retains these bonds in this holding, it has indicated that it intends to sell them as soon as possible, provided conditions of financial stability permit.  The Central Bank, in common with other National Central Banks of the Eurosystem, can hold financial assets only up to particular limits as part of agreements between the various members of the Eurosystem.

To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence. The gross income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or qualified cohabitants. A person may claim a deferral if their gross income will not, &ldquo;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&rdquo; exceed these thresholds in that year.</p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.</p><p>  The full and partial deferral thresholds may be increased in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  The deferral option in such qualifying cases will apply until the end of 2017.</p><p>  Additional reliefs introduced in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provide that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The 2013 Act also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  </p><p>  Interest of c. 4% per annum is charged on deferred amounts. This is half the interest rate charged in cases of non-compliance.</p><p>  Deferrals allow tax not paid in a year to be rolled forward to be paid at a later date.  Elections for deferrals are voluntary, subject to eligibility. Where properties change hands through gifts or inheritances, the charge need not be paid and the deferral option may continue and accumulate, provided the new owners meet the eligibility requirements for deferrals provided for in the legislation.</p><p>  Taxpayers who had deferred payment, but who are no longer eligible for deferrals due to improved financial circumstances, have the option of leaving the original deferrals in place in respect of previous tax liabilities, or of paying them off either in single payments or gradually.   </p><p>  Any amount deferred will be a relatively small part of the overall value of the property, even where the deferral lasts for a number of years or in cases where the higher rate of 0.25% applies to a portion of the value.</p></reply>

The stated aim of the Report is to provide an analysis of the experience of MABS clients with mortgage difficulties, often in addition to other debts and other issues, as well as the experience of MABS money advice staff working with those clients to come to a resolution that is &ldquo;mutually acceptable, affordable and sustainable.&rdquo;   Regarding the particular issue of split mortgage, the Deputy will be aware that split mortgage was one of a number of possible arrangements suggested by the 2011 Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group) report to address significant mortgage difficulty.  Other options such as trade down mortgages, mortgage to rent scheme and negative equity mortgages were also referenced in the Keane report.  The split mortgage concept involves splitting a distressed mortgage into an affordable mortgage and warehousing the balance. The Central Bank has advised that the majority of lenders have introduced, or are in the process of introducing a split mortgage arrangement.  While lenders have taken the broad approach set out in the Keane report, the particular split mortgage details can vary from lender to lender. </p><p>  However the sustainability of a split mortgage, like all other forbearance and modification arrangements, is based on affordability and other relevant factors having regard to the specific circumstances of the individual case and the legitimate long term interests of both borrower and lender.</p></reply>

This relief will apply to purchases made on or after 1st July this year. The amount to be repaid will vary according to a sliding scale, by reference to the price at which auto-diesel is purchased. The maximum amount repayable will be 7.5 cent per litre. To qualify for the repayment, road haulage operators in the State must hold either an<b></b>  international road haulage operator's licence or a national road haulage operator's licence, issued under the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006.  Road haulage operators established in another Member State must hold an equivalent licence recognised under EU law.</p><p>  Bus operators in the State will be required to hold an international road passenger operator's licence or a national road passenger operator's licence issued under the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006.

This includes buses and minibuses with seating for a minimum of nine passengers. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners who have responsibility for the operation of the repayment scheme that, except where the auto-diesel is purchased in bulk by the qualifying transport operator, payment must be made by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue for that purpose. Revenue will approve a fuel card where the fuel card provider undertakes to provide such information as they require in relation to the fuel card purchases, and continues to act in accordance with that undertaking. The fuel card must be approved before any repayment claim is made in relation to fuel card purchases. </p><p>  Any operator who claims a repayment, and who is established in the State, must hold a current tax clearance certificate. Any claimant who is established in another Member State must show that he or she is tax compliant in that Member State.</p><p>  Qualifying road transport operators will be required to register with Revenue before any claim for repayment is submitted. Claims will be made in respect of auto-diesel purchased during a three-month repayment period. Revenue is currently developing the IT systems for submission and processing of repayment claims, with a view to issuing the first repayments before the end of the year. The detail of the requirements for the administration of the scheme, and the Revenue Commissioners regulations to support them, are also in preparation, and there is ongoing consultation with trade interests in that regard.</p></reply>

In turn this lowers the cost of borrowing, helps to put public debt on a declining path and contributes to increased investor confidence. Having said that I fully recognise that there will be a short term reduction in economic activity before these medium to long-term growth benefits associated with a lower sovereign risk premium and the subsequent pass-through to private sector sentiment is realised. In recent years this strategy has shown some results for the non-traded sector. Inward investment remains strong and exports from Ireland are now considerably above their pre-crisis level. In addition, bond yields on government debt have fallen sharply.   The economic forecasts underpinning Budget 2013 were drawn up to be consistent with the expenditure consolidation set out on Budget day and included provisions for savings through a reduction in the public service pay bill of &euro;300m in 2013 and an overall reduction of &euro;1bn by 2015. As set out in the forecasts, the government consumption component of GDP is set to decline in every year to 2015, consistent with policy-related objectives of reducing the wage bill. These forecasts were updated at the end of last month for the Irish Stability Programme &ndash; April 2013 Update. They continue to reflect the consolidation envelope laid out at Budget time as well as the outturn for 2012 as estimated by the CSO.</p></reply>

By way of eBrief No. 29/12 (dated 29/6/2012) Revenue advised that they had updated their Tax and Duty manuals to reflect matters relating to the new SARP.  Details of the relief are also included in Revenue's Guide &quot;Supporting Job Creation and other Enterprise Supports&quot;.  Details of these and other documentation in relation to SARP, including  the claim form, are available on Revenue's website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.   </p><p>  Paragraph 10 of Section 14 provides that relevant employers must submit an annual return to the Revenue Commissioners detailing, inter alia, the number of employees and the amounts of exempt income claimed under the programme.  As 2012 was the first year of the programme, this return was not sought until after the end of the tax year 2012 in order to ensure that an accurate picture as possible of take up levels over a full tax year could be provided. </p><p>  Employer returns received to date for 2012 indicate that there were 6 individuals who qualified for the relief with 2 of them receiving an aggregate total tax-free remuneration of &euro;39,767.  Job increases were reported as numbering 26 with 2 jobs also reported as retained because of the relief.  It is expected that the 4 individuals who are not reported in the employer returns as receiving tax-free remuneration are expected to claim it when they submit Form 11 tax returns for 2012 in late 2013.  Until the details from these returns are available it would be premature to attempt an estimate of the amount of tax that would be saved for the Exchequer if SARP was abolished in 2014.</p><p>  It is possible that not all employers have submitted a SARP return yet.  Also, the figures provided do not include the details for claims that are not included in employer returns received to date but will be made in the Form 11 tax returns for 2012 to be filed under the self-assessment system in October/November of 2013.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for the relief, an individual must be aged 55 years or over.  The relief also applies to the disposal by an individual of all or part of the shares of a company which is a trading or farming company and the individual&rsquo;s family company or a member of a trading group of which the holding company is the individual&rsquo;s family company.  It also applies to certain personally owned assets which are used by the company and to land which has been leased under the 1992, 1999 or 2005 EU Early Retirement From Farming Schemes, where the land was owned by an individual for a period of at least 10 years and used by him for the purposes of farming throughout that period.    </p><p>  Land which has been let for the period of 5 years prior to its disposal under a compulsory purchase order for the purposes of road-building or road-widening, but prior to its first letting was farmed for 10 years by the person making the disposal, also qualifies for retirement relief as does land which has been let at any time in the period of 15 years prior to its disposal but, prior to its first letting, was farmed for 10 years by the person making the disposal and the disposal is to a child.  For this purpose, &quot;child&quot; includes certain nephews and nieces and foster children of the individual concerned. </p><p>  The assets or shares in question must have been owned by the individual for a period of not less than 10 years ending on the date of the disposal and must have been chargeable business assets throughout the 10-year period ending with the disposal (subject to the variation mentioned above in relation to land that is let for part of the period of ownership). </p><p>  In addition, where the disposal is of shares, the company in which the shares were held must have been a trading or farming company and the individual's family company, or a member of a trading company of which the holding company is the individual's family company, during a period of not less than 10 years ending on the date of disposal.  Moreover, in any case, the individual must have been a working director of the company for a period of not less than 10 years during which he or she has been a full-time director for not less than 5 years. </p><p>  In the case of disposals outside the family, the relief threshold is currently &euro;750,000, that is to say, where the value of the consideration given for the disposal is less than or equal to &euro;750,000, any gain accruing on disposal is fully relieved.  Marginal relief may apply in certain situations.  The current threshold of &euro;750,000 that applies to disposals outside the family will be reduced to &euro;500,000 for disposals of qualifying assets by individuals aged 66 or over on or after 1 January 2014.</p><p>  In the case of disposals within the family, there is no restriction at present on the amount of relief that can be claimed but a cap of &euro;3m will apply to disposals, on or after 1 January 2014, of qualifying assets by individuals aged 66 or over.  If qualifying assets on which relief is granted are disposed of within 6 years, the relief granted is clawed back.</p><p>  From information on personal tax returns for 2011, the most recent year available, 58 individuals claimed capital gains tax retirement relief within the family on disposals where the consideration exceeded &euro;1.5million.  The total aggregate consideration in respect of these 58 disposals was &euro;292.8 million.  The number of individuals that claimed capital gains tax retirement relief on disposals outside the family where the consideration exceeded &euro;500,000 was 148.  The total aggregate consideration in respect of these 148 disposals was &euro;117.7 million.    </p><p>  However, as the amount entered on tax returns refer to the value of the consideration and not the actual capital gains, there is no dedicated basis for separately identifying an estimate of the yield that would have arisen in these cases if the lower cap had been in place for the 2011 tax year.  Accordingly the specific information requested by the Deputy is not available.</p></reply>

It would therefore be necessary to know each of these elements in relation to each property sold before it could be established whether a gain or a loss arises on each property.  Where a loss is made on the sale of a chargeable asset, that loss is allowable against other chargeable gains made in the same year or, if not capable of being so used, is carried forward against losses in future years.   Where a chargeable asset now being sold was acquired prior to 6 April 1974, the market value of the property at 6 April 1974 is substituted for its cost price.   The market value at 6 April 1974 or the cost price, if purchased between 6 April 1974 and 31 December 2002, is indexed to take account of the effects of inflation, so that only the real gain in monetary terms is chargeable. </p><p>  For example a property with a market value of (say) &euro; 15,000 at 6 April 1974 would be indexed by an indexation factor of 6.112, so that the adjusted base cost/market value would be &euro;91,680. Any consideration on sale in excess of this indexed base cost would be a chargeable gain (subject to any necessary adjustment for incidental costs associated with the sale as well as any enhancement expenditure that may have been incurred).  On the other hand, a property purchased in 2005 for (say) &euro;500,000, might only realize (say) &euro;300,000 if sold today &ndash; giving rise to an allowable loss to the taxpayer of &euro;200,000, which could be set against other chargeable gains, thereby potentially reducing the amount of CGT that would be raised.</p><p>  As principal private residences have been exempt from capital gains tax since its introduction in 1975, each of the elements required to calculate a gain or a loss are not returned by taxpayers or otherwise collected by Revenue in a manner that would enable a chargeable gain or allowable loss to be calculated.  Neither the introduction of local property tax nor the preparatory work that preceded it will be of assistance in estimating the yield from the removal of the CGT exemption for principal private residences.</p><p>  Given the fall in the value of residential properties in recent years, it is likely that many residences, if sold, would not make a chargeable gain &ndash; and would in fact incur a loss, thereby reducing the CGT that would be raised in such cases. </p><p>  It is necessary to balance the collection of statistical information for Exchequer purposes with the desire to minimise as far as possible the administrative burden placed on individual taxpayers and on the business community to provide such information in tax returns.  In the circumstances, I have no plans to require taxpayers to provide the information necessary to estimate the possible yield from removing the exemption. Policies are formulated using the best available data having regard for the need for balance for the reason outlined.</p></reply>

The latter is the reduction in income tax chargeable which would apply in the case of a single person under 55 based on the &ldquo;specified limit&rdquo; of &euro;2,000 multiplied by the standard rate of tax.  In 2010, the cost to the Exchequer of the rent relief scheme is estimated at approximately &euro;83 million.

However, the Group recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue.  For this reason, the Group suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years.  The Group also considered that it was a matter for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes.  There is no provision in the current legislation for such deductions.  While it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis, neither the manner in which this will happen or the timing have yet been decided.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate the potential cost to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

In February 2013 a request for submissions was published on the Department&rsquo;s website inviting interested parties to make submissions on the terms of the review by the 12th April 2013.  The terms of reference for this paper included the base year.

However, by way of long standing practice stretching back over 40 years, the expenses deduction due for certain categories of employee are, for administrative ease, agreed between Revenue and the relevant representative bodies. These agreed rates of expenses are granted to individuals in their determination of tax credits for PAYE purposes and have become known as &ldquo;flat rate expenses&rdquo;.  The Revenue Commissioners publish such agreed flat rate expenses on their website at   http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/employee-expenses.html</p><p>  Therefore, some employees obtain their statutory tax deduction in respect of expenses via the administrative &ldquo;flat rate expenses&rdquo; regime whilst others obtain their tax deduction on foot of an individual claim submitted to the Revenue Commissioners.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer of the tax deduction in respect of expenses (other than expenses of travel and subsistence) incurred by employees for the income tax year 2010, the most recent year for which final information is available, is estimated at  &euro;66.5 million.</p></reply>

This protection covers any information collected in the Census and the Act gives a legal guarantee that information provided on census forms will be treated as strictly confidential by the CSO.    I am also advised, however, that information from the CSO Census 2011 at Small Area level was used by the Commissioners in developing their valuation guidance.  &ldquo;Small areas&rdquo; are areas of population comprising between 50 and 200 dwellings created by the National Institute of Regional and Spatial Analysis on behalf of the Ordnance Survey Ireland, in consultation with CSO.  The information provided by the CSO included property type (percentages of properties of different types for each small area) and age of property (percentages of properties constructed in each of the last 5 decades and pre-1960 for each small area).  As the information is at neighbourhood level, it does not identify or include any information on specific properties or owners and consequently access to it is not restricted by the Statistics Act. </p><p>  I am further advised that Revenue&rsquo;s valuation guidance, which is based on sales since January 2010 taken from Revenue&rsquo;s stamp duty records, also uses data from the CSO&rsquo;s Residential Property Price Index to adjust for price changes in the interim.  The Property Price Index provides guidance on establishing the percentage reduction to be applied to the price obtained for properties sold in 2010, 2011 or 2012.  </p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate from the foregoing, the Revenue Commissioners used CSO data for the purposes of LPT administration where they were legally permitted to do so.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to identify possible new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  I believe that the recommendations on structural changes will complement other reforms already in train and assist in positioning Ireland at the forefront of teacher education. The implementation of the panel's recommendations concerning research will contribute to this goal. I agree with the review panel that there should be a culture of research in teacher education where staff are familiar with current research and are engaged in research on critical areas of teaching and teacher education. </p><p>  The panel made comments on the staffing situation in ITE institutes. I too am concerned that ITE providers have access to and can retain suitably qualified and experienced personnel.  It is hoped that the move to larger institutions will provide more critical mass and certainty for staff planning and development purposes. In the meantime, however, we are required to comply with necessary restrictions on recruitment and employee numbers, given the difficult position with the public finances.</p><p>  In terms of the quality of entrants to ITE programmes, as a State we endeavour to set high standards of literacy and numeracy for all school leavers and to produce well informed critical thinkers across various disciplines. The academic standard of entrants to ITE programmes is high. Nonetheless, the Teaching Council, as part of its ongoing and multifaceted work on improving the quality of teaching, is currently undertaking a review of entry requirements and I look forward to receiving its advice in due course.</p><p>  My Department is also keen to ensure that forecasting mechanisms are developed to ensure an adequate supply of teachers with the required qualifications. However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables. Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict. I have asked the Teaching Council to advise on this issue. My Department will work with the Council and other relevant stakeholders, as required, towards developing such mechanisms.</p><p>  In the meantime, the numbers approved for entry to State-funded primary ITE programmes will continue to be subject to limits, as I do not believe it is in the interest of graduates or the teaching profession that there be an unregulated increase in graduate teachers from the public sector in the short to medium term.  The level of intake to these Colleges has decreased in recent years in light of available resources and factors impacting on demand.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements in small primary schools are considerably more favourable than other medium to larger schools. </p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement. The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are affected by the budget measure. In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. </p><p>  The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/2013. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Under the new arrangements<b>,</b> Departments now invite expressions of interest from the public in vacancies on the boards of bodies under their aegis on their websites.  It is open to all members of the public regardless of gender, political affiliations or geographically location to apply for appointment to these vacancies.  I am satisfied that the new arrangements introduced by the Government in 2011 have significantly improved transparency in the making of appointments to State Boards compared with the making of appointments in previous years.  Since the formation of this Government 16 members have been nominated to State Boards, 25% of which being female.  In view of the statutory procedures for the appointment of members of the Civil Service Arbitration Board and the Public Appointments Service, there is limited scope for me to take a factor such as gender into account when I make such appointments.  I would like to make it clear that it is my intention in the limited number of appointments I have to make to increase the number of women appointees over the lifetime of the Government.</p></reply>

The Government has established a Steering Group comprising the relevant Departments and NewERA to examine these issues and to report back to Ministers on the matter. NewERA, on behalf of the Steering Group, has worked closely with Coillte to analyse the various financial, policy and technical issues arising, which include <i>inter alia</i> the issue of public access to the forests, replanting obligations to ensure the continued existence of our forests, harvesting policy, the issue of supply of timber to the local saw mills, etc., as well as the implications for Coillte itself.  A number of specialist advisers have been engaged by Coillte to further inform this process. The implications of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters for the form and timing of an eventual harvesting rights transaction are also among the matters that are being explored.</p></reply>

In these instances NERA investigates employers who are using the term &lsquo;au pair&rsquo; to avoid their statutory obligations under employment law.  Where the employment status of an individual is in question, the provisions of the "Code of Practice Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals" are used in order to determine the employment status of the relationship.</p><p>  Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment in another person&rsquo;s home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under law (including the right to the National Minimum Wage) as all other employees.</p><p>  Guidance and information for both workers and employers as to the employment of persons in domestic situations is contained in the "Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People's Homes" which was developed in 2007 by Labour Relations Commission in consultation with social partners.  Further information on employment rights is available by phone from 1890 80 80 90 or online from www.workplacerelations.ie.</p><p>  Where people have concerns that employees may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter may be reported to NERA for investigation.

In 2013, the Citizens Information Board has been allocated a budget of approximately &euro;47.5 million of which some &euro;19 million has been assigned to MABS.  In 2012 the corresponding allocation was &euro;46.8 million and &euro;18.3 million respectively.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service is made up of a network of 53 companies, which includes 51 local companies and 2 national companies MABS National Development Limited and National Traveller MABS. There are some 277 money advice staff employed across the MABS network. </p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 provides for a Debt Relief Notice for persons with no assets or income with unsecured debts of up to &euro;20,000. With the assistance of an approved intermediary, a person may apply for a Debt Relief Notice which will allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt after a three year supervision period. The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has the statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) has agreed to my request that MABS be an approved intermediary for the purpose of processing applications for Debt Relief Notices. Those who can avail of Debt Relief Notices are typically part of the MABS core client cohort of people on low incomes in debt or in danger of falling into debt. </p><p>  Sanction has been given for 16 temporary staff to be assigned to MABS for up to 2 years, to establish an Approved Intermediary Service as part of the new Insolvency Service. The CIB and MABS National Development Limited are working closely to ensure that the appropriate structures are in place within MABS to implement this new and important statutory role. They have also engaged proactively with the Insolvency Service to ensure that the Approved Intermediary Service is fully operational in time for the establishment of the Insolvency Service.  I am satisfied that MABS will play an important role in the new arrangements for dealing with debt and will continue to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website www.keepingyourhome.ie and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower's choosing for the provision of this advice.  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  All interested organisations will have an opportunity to input to the review of the service.  I have had no meetings on this issue with the Professional Insurance Brokers Association and I am arranging for officials of my Department to meet with this organisation in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department.  The official dealing with the request will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the particular case and the tenant&rsquo;s preference will be accommodated where possible.</p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process.</p><p>  The Department has no plans to implement a system whereby landlords would have to sign off each month showing that they have received rent from a rent supplement recipient.  The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if the Department had to create a formal relationship with all landlords, for what should be only a short term need.</p><p>  The Government has approved in principle the transfer of responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from this Department to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under the proposed arrangements for HAP, landlords will receive the rent for the property directly from the housing authority.  The Department is working closely with officials from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.</p></reply>

To qualify a person needs to:</p><p>- enter insurable employment by age 55 for State Pension (transition) and age 56 for State Pension (contributory),</p><p>- have paid 520 full rate social insurance contributions</p><p>- have a yearly average contributions of at least 10 for State pension (contributory), and at least 24 for State pension (transition).</p><p>The yearly average determines the weekly rate of payment.</p><p>An increase in the State pension for a spouse or partner (qualified adult) can be paid. This element of the State pension is means tested.  Any income the qualified adult has from employment, self-employment, savings, investments and capital (for example, any property except the person&rsquo;s home) is taken into account.  Where there is joint savings or investments with the spouse or partner, half of that amount is taken into account.   An increase for a qualified adult may be payable if the qualified adult has weekly income of less than &euro;310.  There are currently approximately 2,500 State pension transition customers and approximately 68,000 State pension contributory customers who have been awarded an increase for a qualified adult.</p><p>Where a person does not meet the qualifying conditions for State pension contributory, they may apply for the means-tested State pension non-contributory.  The means test for State pension non-contributory takes into account the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse or partner.   Capital, property (excluding a person's home), savings and investments are assessed as capital and a formula is then used to assess the weekly means from capital.   The weekly rate payable depends on the total weekly means of the person or couple.</p><p>The formula for assessing means from capital is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Capital </th><th>Weekly means assessed</th></tr><tr><td>First &euro;20,000 </td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000 </td><td>&euro;1 per &euro;1,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000 </td><td>&euro;2 per &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Balance</td><td>&euro;4 per &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>There are currently approximately 95,000 customers in receipt of State pension non-contributory.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, who provide services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including Counties Meath and Westmeath, can be found on ComReg's website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme. NBS services are available within 26 of the 106 Electoral Divisions in County Meath, including the Electoral Division of Bective, and within 18 of the 92 Electoral Divisions in County Westmeath, the list of which is set out as follows.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has appointed experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including the Bellinter and Bective areas as well as all rural areas in Counties Meath and Westmeath, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p><bu>National Broadband Scheme (NBS)</bu></p><p><bu>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in Co.

These funds can only be used as capital by local authorities for their Part V functions or functions under the Housing Acts. Data regarding the specific application of these funds are not collated by the Department.</p><p>  In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts. These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.</p><p>  The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.</p><p>  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.</p><p>  While I appreciate that these GGB requirements impose limitations on local authorities, there are considerable funding constraints at all levels of Government. It is a matter for every local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.</p></reply>

Edit Snippet   |   Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet  |  Insert Question Heading  | Quick Edit    Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan): My Department collates and publishes a wide range of housing and planning statistics that inform the preparation and evaluation of policy, and those data are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.   Data on the number of housing units and / or lands transferred under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts and on payments in lieu of such transfers, broken down by year and by local authority, are included within this range.   Comprehensive guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to Part V including advice in relation to the use of Part V funds. These funds can only be used as capital by local authorities for their Part V functions or functions under the Housing Acts. Data regarding the specific application of these funds are not collated by the Department.   In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts. These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.   The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.   In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.   While I appreciate that these GGB requirements impose limitations on local authorities, there are considerable funding constraints at all levels of Government. It is a matter for every local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.

Ireland has been dealing with the issue of radioactive waste for some time. My Department is currently developing the necessary Regulations to ensure that Ireland meets its obligations to transpose this Directive. The establishment of a National Implementation Committee (NIC) was one of the recommendations made in the Interim Report of the Interdepartmental High-Level Group on Radioactive Waste which was accepted by Government in December 2010.    The NIC was established to progress work on;   Developing an Inventory Reduction Programme to reduce the overall amount of waste requiring storage in Ireland;   The interim centralisation of sources by sector in a small number of sector-specific existing storage facilities;   The development of options for final disposal.   It comprises co-ordinators nominated by the key stakeholders in the sectors where disused sources are held; technical advice is also provided by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).   The Committee is chaired by my Department.   It is too early in the process to attempt to quantify the costs that may arise as a consequence of the transposition of the Directive.   These will be influenced by the quantity of such waste requiring long-term management in Ireland. Snippet Ref No: WRT01150 ...

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;287m in 2013 and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.</p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate the final outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units.  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.  However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the relevant housing authority to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the schemes, and to have appropriate oversight and liaison arrangements in place for the effective administration of the schemes and for ensuring that the investment in voluntary housing is safeguarded.</p><p>At the end of 2012 a total of 25,371 units of accommodation had been provided by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies under my Department&rsquo;s capital funding schemes since the inception of the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) in 1984 and the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) in 1992.  Exchequer funding of &euro;1.3 billion was provided under the CAS for the provision of some 15,262 units of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need such as older people, the homeless and persons with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability.</p><p>Under the CLSS, mortgage finance was provided to approved housing bodies by way of loans from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to meet the cost of providing social rented accommodation for low-income families.  At end 2012, approved housing bodies had provided some 10,109 units of accommodation and loans to the value of around &euro;1.4 billion had been drawn down from the HFA.  The CLSS was terminated in 2009 and expenditure in respect of projects over the period 2010 to end 2012 relates to projects at construction or approved to commence construction prior to the decision to terminate the scheme.</p><p>In 2012 My Department recouped some &euro;58 million to Local Authorities (LA&rsquo;s) in respect of voluntary and co-operative projects progressed under the CAS Loan charges and management and maintenance allowances of over &euro;68 million were recouped to LA&rsquo;s in respect of accommodation provided under the CLSS.  Earlier this year I announced capital allocations to local authorities under the CAS amounting to some &euro;38.5 million.  Detailed information in relation to the amounts of CAS funding recouped to each of the AHB&rsquo;s across all local authorities in respect of the CAS for 2012 is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate the likely drawdown of CAS funding by individual AHB&rsquo;s over the course of 2013.</p><p>A number of AHB&rsquo;s have entered into service level agreements with local authorities for the management and maintenance of social housing units which may be either leased or owned by the relevant authority.

The issue of refusals is dealt with through the allocation schemes made by each housing authority as required under   Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and Regulations made thereunder (the Social Housing Allocation Regulations 2011), which set out the conditions that housing authorities must take into account when making their allocation schemes. The making and amendment of such an allocation scheme is a reserved function of the elected members of each housing authority.   </p><p>  Under the 2011 Regulations , where a household refuses two reasonable offers of accommodation within a continuous 12 month period , that household will not be considered by any local authority for social housing support for a period of 12 months from the date of the second refusal. In such cases, the household remains on the list but is excluded from consideration for offers of accommodation for the 12 month period. During this time, the household is not entitled to accrue any benefit from being on the list for priority purposes.   </p><p>  In addition, the 2011 Regulations allow a housing authority to opt for a Choice-Based Letting approach to allocations in its allocation scheme. Choice- Based Letting is a method that can be used for the allocation of social housing which is designed to offer more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home , thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal. </p></reply>

This includes but is not limited to being independent of Government.  The question of whether Commissioners should be nominated by any social partner organisation or be representative of any particular sector or NGO was expressly considered by the Working Group I set up to advise me on practical issues in relation to the establishment of the new Commission.  The Group recommended that members of the new Commission be selected by a process independent of the Government, serving on appointment independently in their individual capacity and that their appointments should not be made on representative or nomination basis as heretofore was the case in relation to a number of positions on the Equality Authority board.</p><p>Members of the Working Group noted the historical development of the Equality Authority from a body purely focused on employment issues with representation from the employer and employee interests.  The Working Group considered with the development of the wider remit of the new IHREC, representation of any corporate body or sectoral interest as of right on the new Commission is not appropriate.  They went on to recommend that the new legislation should allow IHREC to establish subcommittees of the Commission to enable representatives of a wide range of interests to contribute in an advisory capacity.  The Government accepted this recommendation (and indeed all the recommendations of the Working Group relating to the legislation) and this is reflected in the General Scheme of the Bill as published.  I might mention that the selection procedure set out in the Heads was also endorsed by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, before whom I caused the General Scheme to be laid and whose advice I sought.  In these circumstances, and as I anticipate that the legislation to establish IHREC will be published before too long, I do not regard it as appropriate to make any appointments as Commissioner designate outside of the independent selection process that has recently concluded with the recommendation of the 14 persons referred to in the question to be members of IHREC and of the existing bodies on an interim basis.</p><p>As already announced, (and detailed in the table below) these 14 persons were appointed by the Government as members of Human Rights Commission on 16 April 2013 under the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, pending the establishment of the IHREC.  The issues in relation to the interim appointments to the board of the Equality Authority, also under the relevant existing legislation (the Employment Equality Act 1998) will be discussed when I meet the members designate shortly.</p><p>  TABLE</p><p><table><tr><th>Name<br />   </th><th>Current Position</th><th>Appointment Period</th></tr><tr><td>Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally </td><td>Professor of Law UCC <br />Member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration The Hague, Member of the Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action Against Human Trafficking</td><td>5 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Ms Teresa Blake</td><td>Chairperson of Mental Health Tribunal, Barrister</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Ms Orlagh O'Farrell</td><td>Lecturer in employment and equality law NUl Maynooth, Member of Community Legal Resource network.

The Military Authorities have advised that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 31 March 2013, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,189 comprising 7,375 Army, 781 Air Corps and 1,033 Naval Service personnel.  Following on from the 2012 recruitment campaign, 539 General Service recruits were enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force.  It is intended that further general service recruitment will take place from the existing competition panel during 2013.  All recruitment will be achieved within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.</p></reply>

As part of the EDA&rsquo;s annual work programme, Ireland participates in project teams and working groups engaged in the ongoing work in various capability development areas that will be of benefit to the Defence Forces.  The four main initiatives that Ireland is involved in are: The Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection launched in 2007.  The Maritime Surveillance Project launched in 2011.  The Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear protection project launched in 2011.  Pooling and Sharing Naval Training Initiative, in which Ireland is taking a lead role, launched in 2011.</p><p>In relation to Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the Pooling and Sharing Naval Training Initiative, the Chief Executive of the European Defence Agency requested Ireland to consider seconding a National Expert to the Agency to progress this initiative.  Ireland agreed to second an Intern to the European Defence Agency, and a Naval Officer has taken up the internship for a six month period beginning on 2nd May 2013.  During the next six months it is hoped that progress will be made in areas such as Hydrography and the use of Simulators for training purposes.  The Agency will cover travel and other expenses and a daily allowance while the Department will pay the salary of the individual involved.</p></reply>

It has been estimated that the overall benefit for the eradication of this disease is beneficial to farmers.

It is now recognised that the first year of the new regime will be 2015. Farmers will apply in that year for an allocation of new payment entitlements.</p><p>  The Commission proposals have been the subject of negotiations at official and political level in the Council of Ministers over the past 18 months culminating in an agreed Council position which was reached at the Council on 18/19 March.  Under the proposals agreed by the Council of Minister, the number of entitlements to be allocated in the first year of the new regime can either be based on the total number of eligible hectares declared in that year or, alternatively, a Member State may decide that the number of entitlements will be confined to the number of eligible hectares declared in either 2012 or 2013.  While this is an option for Member States it is too early yet to say which option will be exercised by Ireland.</p><p>  Member States are also allowed to confine the allocation of payment entitlements to those farmers who received a payment under the existing Single Payment Scheme in either 2010 or 2011.  Where a Member States exercises this option, the European Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to determine how entitlements are to be allocated to farmers who apply in the first year of the new regime but who did not receive payment in either 2010 or 2011.  Again, it is too early to say whether Ireland will exercise this particular option.</p><p>  I should also point out that the next step in the negotiations involves reaching agreement between the three European Institutions i.e. the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission.  It is therefore too early to speculate on how the final outcome will affect individual farmers.</p></reply>

Up to today 11 trilogues have taken place; three each on direct payments and rural development, four on the single CMO and one on the horizontal and financial management proposal.  As holders of the Presidency, Ireland is representing the EU Council of Ministers in these negotiations.</p><p>  On the Direct Payments dossier, we have now had a run though of the proposals for the basic payment scheme including the various options for internal convergence, the national reserve and the redistributive payment.  We have also discussed the scope and definitions, the provisions on active farmers, coupled support and the schemes for young farmers and small farmers. On Monday, we started looking at the provisions on capping and flexibility between pillars.</p><p>  As to the single CMO, we have looked at the introductory provisions, trade issues and the school schemes. We have also commenced examination of specific sectoral rules starting with olive oil, hops, apiculture, fruit and vegetables and wine as well as the PDO and PGI provisions. Yesterday there was a first discussion on market intervention, exceptional measures and the crisis reserve. </p><p>  Moving to rural development, we have had a first discussion on the objectives and priorities and have started a more detailed discussion on the individual measures.  </p><p>  Finally, we have examined general and financial management provisions in the Horizontal Regulation.</p><p>  The first trilogues have taken place in a very constructive and positive atmosphere, with working methods agreed, technical issues identified for further examination and initial discussions taking place on more difficult political points.  These trilogues are continuing with the target of achieving inter-institutional agreement by the end of June 2013.  I am aware that this is a very challenging time frame and will require intense efforts by all parties to the negotiation.</p><p>  On the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, I can tell you that to date we have adhered to the general approach agreed by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in March.  On many issues, the Council position is at the centre of the negotiations but there are areas where the Council is isolated and may have to move if common ground is to be found.  I have established informal contacts with the Chair of the European Parliament Agriculture Committee and the EU Commissioner with a view to identifying the scope for acceptable compromises on some of the more intractable political issues.  In addition, I will be using next week&rsquo;s meeting of the EU Council of Ministers in Brussels and the informal Agriculture Council meeting scheduled to take place in Dublin at the end of the month to explore with Member State colleagues possible landing zones in key areas of difference.  </p></reply>

As a result, the annual cost of the ECCE programme has risen over the course of 2010 to date.</p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was advised that this would be the case, and this was reflected in the additional budgetary provision of &euro;9.8m which was secured for the ECCE programme in 2012.</p><p>  It is my intention to maintain the free pre-school year as a universal programme despite the continued increase in the number of eligible children which the latest CSO study continues to indicate, and the fact that additional funding may be required.</p><p>  I am also very conscious that work is continuing on improvement of quality within the pre-school year. All of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the provision is key to obtaining good outcomes for children.  In particular, I would like to see further progress in workforce development within the sector and I will be working with my colleagues, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection, to determine how this might be managed in the context of current financial constraints.</p></reply>

This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector. There are some 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and over 40,000 volunteers involved in the provision of services and activities for young people.   </p><p>  Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth services. Youth work and non - formal learning in its many programmes and activities; recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and personal development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, resilience,  motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills; the 21st century skills that are so important to equip young people for the challenges in today&rsquo;s world.  </p><p>  My Department works closely with the youth sector organisations to address the needs of children and young people. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee is an important source of advice and guidance to my Department in developing youth policy and initiatives.  The committee is composed of a chairperson and 32 members drawn equally from the voluntary and statutory sectors involved in the administration and provision of youth work programmes and services. This committee advises my Department on matters relating to the development and coordination of youth work policies, programmes and services. </p><p>  I have met, and will continue to meet, with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of the savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and to see how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available in order to continue to support the provision of quality youth services to young people.</p></reply>

The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency. It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &euro;590 million. The Agency will be headed by Gordon Jeyes, as the Chief Executive designate, who will be supported by a senior management team.  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the Agency will have a broader focus than child protection. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic &amp;amp; care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.</p><p>  It is my intention that the new Agency will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many of the children and families with the most complex needs. At the same time, the Agency will have a role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function. </p><p>  The new Child and Family Support Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector of reform embarked upon by this Government. The level of resources available to the Agency year on year will be progressed through the usual Estimates process in the context of service planning and performance monitoring processes.</p></reply>

This initiative was announced as part of Budget 2013 and has a funding allocation this  year of &euro;2.5 million,  This is expected to increase to &euro;4.75 million in 2015.  The Initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people where these are currently significantly poorer than they are for children and young people living elsewhere in the State.  Officials in my Department are currently engaged in discussions with a philanthropic partner with a view to securing additional co-funding for the programme.</p><p>  The new programme will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme which has also been implemented by my Department.  This earlier programme involved the implementation of a range of evidence based programmes and practices on a pilot basis in three areas of high social and economic disadvantage.  The programmes aimed at improving outcomes for children and young people in relation to literacy, speech and language, health and pro-social behaviour as well as supporting improved parenting skills.  The programmes are currently being evaluated by national and international experts.</p><p>  The three existing areas of programme interventions, together with at least three additional areas, are expected to participate in the new programme.  In addition, it is my intention to broaden the impact of the programme by, where appropriate, beginning the process of mainstreaming as many as possible of the evidence based programmes which have  had positive test outcomes and are cost-effective.  The establishment of my Department's new Child and Family Agency later this year will be important to this process.  </p><p>  Officials in my Department are leading a cross-Departmental Project Team to ensure that arrangements for the introduction of the new programme are put in places at the earliest possible date.  Applications to participate in the programme were invited from interested consortia last month and the closing date for their receipt is 31st May 2013.  Information relating to the application process is available from my Department.  </p></reply>

In order for the public to have confidence in a youth justice system, it needs to be reasonably assured that it is effective in its policies and delivery.</p><p>  The focus for the forthcoming Youth Justice Action Plan   will be to continue the downward trends in high volume crime and detention; becoming more adept in understanding and intervening in more serious crime offending patterns; and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions in addressing the behaviour and needs of these children. The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities. Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.   </p><p>  Of course, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a range of supports to families and children which, although not directly related to juvenile offenders, seek to address many of the social and economic contributory factors. I hope to bring a seamless new approach to policy development and integrated service provision for children so that they have the best possible start to life. In order to design and develop effec  tive policies and services that make a difference, then as a first step, we need to better understand our children: their lives, their experiences, their expectations.</p><p>  My Department's National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives  2011-2016   sets out a 5 year plan to guide and support the development and use of research and data on children&rsquo;s lives, for the purpose of improving understandings and creating an evidence base to support policy and practice. Several of the priority areas identified in the strategy relate to the experience of children and young people in contact or in danger of coming in contact with the justice system. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the commitment given at broader systemic and cultural level through the way we deliver services, in particular through the work of the new Child and Family Agency (CFA) which will be established this year.    At the heart of the new Agency will be a new Service Delivery Framework, which will differentiate between child welfare and protection cases, such that family and child welfare concerns can be responded to by new multi-agency, community-based models for early intervention and family support. The new Agency will represent the practical application of a new approach towards 'proportionate' service responses. </p></reply>

The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  Its work programme is informed by the knowledge and experience of the partners involved and most particularly by the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE and by the National Youth Council of Ireland which is the representative body for some 50 youth organisations in Ireland.</p><p>  This work is achieved through the development of programmes and interventions specifically for and with youth organisations throughout the country and the provision of training and support for workers and volunteers who implement these programmes.   It is covered under the Mindout Mental Health Promotion training and resource pack delivered to youth organisations.  The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway. MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people,  looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.  Mindout adopts a universal mental health promotion approach which has strong links with the &ldquo;Support for all&rdquo; element of the recent guidelines on Mental Health Promotion for Schools published by the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.   </p><p>  The National Youth Health Programme also offers a Specialist Certificate in Youth Health Promotion.  This programme is accredited by NUI Galway and adopts a whole organisational approach to health promotion.  It focuses on a holistic model of an individual&rsquo;s health and mental health and reinforces youth work as a valuable setting for mental health promotion. </p><p>  Actions needed to address this issue obviously extend beyond the remit of my Department. My Department is currently leading the preparation of the new Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework which will represent a whole-for government approach to addressing issues affecting children and young people including their well being.</p></reply>

The Government has a range of measures in place to tackle youth unemployment and these include programmes and initiatives in education, training, job search assistance/ work experience and to encourage job creation.   </p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, my aim is to highlight the potential youth work can play, as part of the response to the youth employment challenges, through collaboration with other interests. Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout the country. Youth Work and non formal learning, in its many programmes and activities, recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and skills development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills- the 21st   century skills that are so important to training and career readiness. There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people as part of a wider employment and enterprise strategy. </p><p>  Youth employment is a theme which I prioritised during my Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers through focusing on the potential of youth work and young people's engagement in youth activities and the way that non formal learning complements more formalised systems of employment, education and training. At the recent EU Youth Conference in Dublin, hosted by the Irish Presidency, over 250 young people and policy makers jointly discussed social inclusion challenges that impact on young people&rsquo;s lives such as employment and social supports as well as the role of quality youth work.</p><p>  I will invite the EU Youth Council later this month to adopt Council Conclusions   on the contribution of youth policy to addressing the goals Europe 2020 to maximise the contribution of youth policy in addressing the challenges young people face.  I also plan, as part of the Presidency programme, to host an expert round table event on quality youth work and its contribution to youth employment (20&ndash;21 June 2013, Kildare). </p><p>  On my invitation the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) has submitted a proposal for the development of a national programme to address the needs of the most marginalised young jobseekers not in education, employment or training.  This proposal is under review in my Department.</p><p>  Minister Bruton published the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs last February on behalf of the Government and in that context my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify in what ways the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to address youth employment.</p></reply>

Step 1 &ndash; the screening staff deal with the information reported and preliminary enquiries are concerned with determining an appropriate response.

Once it is agreed by the duty team leader that it is a correct referral it is allocated immediately for an Initial Assessment.  Step 3 &ndash; the initial assessment is a time-limited process to allow the gathering of sufficient information on the needs and risks within a case so that informed decisions and recommendations can be made and actions that will result in better outcomes for children are taken.</p><p>  The duty team leader together with members of the team will deem the information received as: level 1 &ndash; child and family must be seen immediately; level 2 &ndash; child and family must be seen within 3 days; level 3 &ndash; child and family be seen within 7 days.</p><p>  In identifying Risk it is the &lsquo;professional judgement&rsquo; of the duty team leader to assess if immediate action is required. Risk is assessed if the child is at &lsquo;ongoing significant risk&rsquo;. This is to be decided based on the information received on the referral: 1) The seriousness of the abuse reported; 2) The likely level of risk to the future safety and welfare of the child; and 3) The degree of professional confidence in the information that either the abuse has occurred and is likely to be repeated or that the child is at immediate risk.  Risk analysis continues throughout the 21 days allocated to complete the assessment.  All information on the extensive process is available on the HSE website under the Standardised Business Process documentation.

Our Programme for Government commits that &ldquo;we will encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students.&rdquo;	</p><p>  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, is an important step in delivering on this commitment to work with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and ensure a safer childhood. </p><p>  In recognising the particular need to tackle homophobic bullying, and the broader issues of prejudice in society, the working group which produced this Action Plan included representatives of BeLonG To Youth Services and the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network); organisations working to support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered young people and to advocate for respect and inclusion of all citizens equally.  </p><p>  As part of its contribution to the Working Group&rsquo;s deliberations BeLong To Youth Services consulted with young people from across Ireland on their experiences of homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Two thirds of the young people consulted had experienced homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Research commissioned by the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network) and BeLong To Youth Services on the experiences of young LGBT people in Irish schools has found that 50% reported the existence of homophobic bullying in their schools. </p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the actions set out in the Action Plan to tackle this problem are being progressed. My Department is currently developing &ldquo;A Children and Young Peoples Policy Framework&rdquo; which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later in 2013. The development of an Anti Bullying Framework is being progressed in the context of this whole-of-government policy framework. My Department is also working to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing. Within this process we will explore any additional clarifications that may be required to further assist schools in their response to bullying. </p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the Education Vote to supplement the existing substantial resources within the system dedicated to the welfare of young people. I understand that work is underway in the Department of Education and Skills to develop new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the Education Partners with a view to their introduction from next September. There will also be engagement with Boards of Management and parents in relation to coordinated training and resources development. </p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools, the National Education Welfare Board has issued guidelines requiring each school to have dedicated policies to prevent or address bullying. Schools must make it clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. </p><p>Since the Action Plan was launched, two successful awareness raising initiatives have been rolled out. The first campaign was launched as part of EU Safer Internet Day in February. As part of it, the Government supported a national anti-cyberbullying media campaign specifically targeted at young people.  The second, which I launched on March 6th  , was the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which was organised by BeLongTo Youth Services and was a key action point of the Plan. </p><p>  The Anti Bullying agenda is a recurring element in all our consultations with young people. It is notable that the majority of the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g initiatives funded by my Department have identified mental health services, cyber bullying and homophobic bullying as priority issues for young people. In response, this has led a number of targeted measures being adopted by service providers across the country. </p><p>  Organisations and schools throughout the country are running anti-bullying campaigns and transition year students continue to pioneer student-led projects aimed at combating bullying and cyber bullying. My Department will continue to support the efforts of these projects and of teenagers who want to play a leading role in the national campaign against bullying. </p><p>  Corporations are also playing their part. I recently organised a number of information nights for parents, teachers and youth workers which were supported by webwise and facebook. IBM have just launched free Activity Kits on cyber bullying, online identity and internet safety coaching and I hope that companies such as these will support the development of the of an anti-bullying website to provide a single point of access to practical advice and support in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours. Preliminary scoping work is underway towards this development.</p><p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and to advance measures to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.</p></reply>

Therefore, efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on the Internet can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, various legal systems, differing societal norms, or other relevant factors in this regard.  Many pro-eating disorder websites may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such, they would be subject to US jurisdiction, and any effective action is therefore limited in nature.</p><p>  Notwithstanding such difficulties, there is in Ireland a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers (ISPs).  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material.  However, pro-eating disorder websites are not regarded as illegal.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, are cognisant of the issues raised in this instance and will continue to pursue an inter-agency response to policy and service developments to best tackle eating disorders overall.  A key feature of this, obviously, is to promote awareness of the dangers involved among the younger sections of our population.</p></reply>

The insurance companies, operating as commercial providers with a view towards profit generation, make commercial decisions about their prices.  However, it is clear that any significant price increases will make it more difficult for customers to renew their policies, therefore I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and my Department.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums.</p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.  The savings targets over this period are to be achieved through a combination of initiatives including rate reductions with private hospitals and consultants, utilisation management, expansion of clinical audit, reductions in high cost drugs and prosthesis, provider reviews and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost, medically appropriate settings.  I will continue to focus strongly on this issue, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a Universal Health Insurance system.</p><p>  In the meantime, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p></reply>

The 2013 National Service Plan includes the provision of 10.3 million hours of home help service, the same level as planned for in 2012.  The number of hours worked by home helps varies according to service needs, given that the home help service requires a unique set of arrangements to achieve the level of flexibility required. On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning the contracts of home helps. Subsequently, on 16th October 2012, it identified mechanisms to define specified hours and protocols to be followed where specified hours are not met  as issues to be addressed. At a further hearing on 12th   December 2012, it noted that management proposals to deal with these issues would be encompassed in a comprehensive delivery model for home help services.</p><p>  The parties subsequently met on a number of occasions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, most recently on 30th April. While significant progress was made on a range of contractual matters including those identified by the Labour Court, the Commission is to refer a number of outstanding issues to the Labour Court.</p></reply>

Under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), for the independent inspection and registration of certain categories of designated centres.  This includes residential care settings for older people.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 and the   <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</i></p><p>  All nursing homes for older people, whether public, private or voluntary, are subject to the same core standards in relation to quality and safety.  HIQA carry out inspections across the nursing home sector to ensure that these Standards are being met and that residents are receiving the best possible care.  Regulation 10 of the Care and Welfare Regulations deals specifically with residents' rights, dignity and consultation. With regard to the National Quality Standards there are 32 standards under 7 groupings, <i>Rights, Protection, Health and Social Needs, Quality of Life, Staffing, The Care Environment and Governance and Management. </i>  They are patient-centred, providing a blueprint for the provision of a higher standard of care delivered against a set of clear and comprehensive criteria.</p><p>  In the case of the centre referred to by the Deputy, the specific matters were addressed by the Registered Provider and resolved to the satisfaction of the HIQA inspector.</p></reply>

These include development of a Performance Improvement Action Plan, an Intermediate Care Service, the control centre reconfiguration project and a trial emergency aeromedical service.

However, people attending outpatient and hospital appointments are, in general, expected to make their own travel arrangements, using private or scheduled public transport. The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients, where transport may be provided.  In these cases, the patient's appointment  should be directly related to the treatment. </p><p>  Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher.  Following implementation of the HSE's non-ambulance patient transport policy, responsibility for the arrangement and provision of non-ambulance transport has moved from the HSE National Ambulance Service to local health offices in each region.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection administers a scheme which may help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.

I established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which is working to unblock access to acute services by improving patient flow through the system, including Beaumont Hospital.  An intensive work programme is underway between the SDU's liaison officers, the Clinical Programmes and Beaumont Hospital teams.  The SDU is satisfied that there is increased engagement at all levels in the hospital, focussing on working to achieve the national targets for unscheduled care so that emergency patients may be seen in a timely manner.</p><p>  There has been some improvement in treatment times for patients at Beaumont Emergency Department (ED).  On a year to date basis, at the end of April 2013, 54% of all ED patients were admitted or discharged within 6 hours and 68% were admitted or discharged within 9 hours.  As measured by the INMO, there were 9% fewer patients on trolleys in the twelve months to the end of April 2013 compared to previous period.  This is on top of the 15% improvement in 2012 compared to 2011.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the additional steps being taken to reduce waiting times at the hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The policy with regard to the disability sector is not condition-specific, with a focus on the development and implementation of policies to enable the Health Service Executive to fund a broad range of supports which enable people with disabilities to live full and independent lives in the community, with health supports provided as appropriate.  In this regard, the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, will assist in achieving a more person-centred service for people with disabilities, including those with sight and blindness issues, as much as other persons who have physical disabilities or related impairments and whose needs and issues are acknowledged in the Review.</p><p>  There are a number of eye conditions which are part of Vision 2020 including cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration.  There are detection and treatment services available at present in community and acute hospital settings for these conditions.  In addition, there are a number of high level strategies which would be relevant to the area of eye health, including Clinical Programmes; Public Health; Health Protection; Positive Ageing and Carers Strategies and Screening initiatives.  A number of these strategies link with the Clinical Ophthalmology Programme.  The health sector will continue to provide and deliver vision services and supports through these programmes and specifically through health prevention, screening and intervention policies and programmes.  In this context, it is not proposed to develop a national vision strategy.</p></reply>

This project is focused on improving call taking and dispatch functions and on delivering improved technology.  This will assist in improving response times and will allow the NAS to deploy emergency resources in a much more effective and efficient manner, on a regional and national basis rather than within small geographic areas.</p><p>  The control centre reconfiguration project is consistent with international best practice and is endorsed by HIQA as the most appropriate approach to improve the quality of services to patients and facilitate investment in technologically enabled service delivery.  The project is also a key element of Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015.  The NAS intends to move the Cork, Tralee and Navan Control Centres to the existing facility in Townsend Street, pending completion of the Tallaght Control Centre.  The NAS is satisfied that the move to Townsend Street will mitigate against existing risks in Cork, Tralee and Navan and will therefore improve the safety of services to patients.</p><p>  The NAS has undertaken appropriate risk assessments in relation to this process.  It is satisfied that Townsend Street can facilitate the interim move of the three control centres and is providing additional staff, training, technology and equipment to facilitate this process.  The transfer will also improve the dynamic utilisation of resources in those areas, including rapid response vehicles, intermediate care vehicles and emergency ambulances.</p></reply>
