It is not legally possible to single out individuals or groups and apply cuts to them on a different basis.  It is the Government&rsquo;s stated position to unwind the measures imposed under the FEMPI Acts as soon as possible with particular regard to the impacts on public service pensions in payment and public service pensioners.</p>  <p>  The Courts are extremely sensitive to retrospective changes to pensions which are viewed as vested property rights.  The Government is required to work within the constitutional and statutory legal framework under which all Irish Governments operate.</p></reply>

The Code draws together the long-established elements of <i>value for money</i>arrangements that have been in place and validated over many years.</p><p>The objective of the Code is to seek to ensure that the State achieves <i>value for money </i>in all areas of public spending.  Consequently, the Code applies to both capital and current expenditure and sets out what is required of public service managers at each point of the expenditure lifecycle as well as how to fulfil those requirements. </p><p>The Public Spending Code encompasses guidance on a variety of issues related to the management of expenditure at each stage of the expenditure lifecycle.  This includes central guidance on the application of appraisal and evaluation methodologies including cost benefit analysis.  This methodological guidance aims to enhance consistency across sectors through common approaches and the use of key technical parameter values needed for quantifying costs and conducting economic appraisals.</p><p>The <i>Public Spending Code</i>is currently under review.  The review of the <i>Public Spending Code</i>involves economic and evaluation resources within Government Departments ensuring that the appraisal framework meets  best practice and the best available advice on measuring and reporting on the costs and benefits, including their distributional impacts, associated with climate change.</p><p>Additional sectoral specific appraisal guidance has been developed in certain areas by relevant Departments, in consultation with my Department, to further detail specific approaches related to that sector.  For instance, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has published the Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have developed parameters and methodology for appraising the impacts on journey reliability, public transport crowding conditions, and reliability.  </p><p>In parallel with and drawing on similar work being done in my Department for the <i>Public Spending Code</i>, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport intend to update and improve their guidance on how to carry out a multi-criteria analysis, in order to make it clearer to practitioners what is expected of this type of appraisal.  They are also updating transport related parameters and will update any central and macroeconomic parameters in line with DPER guidance. More specific information on transport specific sectoral guidance is available on request from the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  In this regard, the Deputy may also be interested in the information on appraisal available on the Department's website  </p><p>Finally, it is expected that the updated <i>Public Spending Code </i>will be able to better inform public investment decisions.  The updated <i>Public Spending Code</i>will be kept under ongoing review to ensure sound decision-making based on the best available analysis and assumptions in light of technical knowledge, best practice guidance and experience of the application of the Code in practice.</p></reply>

The recently completed mid-term review of the Capital Plan 2016-2021 has confirmed that allocation.</p>  <p>  The indicated allocation of capital funding for flood risk management in the Capital Plan for 2018 is &euro;70m.  The actual allocation will be published in the Revised Estimates for Public Services after the Budget.  The significantly increased allocation in 2018 will allow the continued progress of all major flood relief projects currently under construction and the anticipated commencement of construction works next year on other projects including Clonakilty, Blackpool, Glashaboy, Douglas and Lower Lee Schemes all in Cork City or County, along with other major schemes at King&rsquo;s Island in Limerick and the Lower Morrell in Kildare.  At the same time, the design and planning of a further 16 schemes from the current Capital Works Programme will continue with the intention that almost all of these will be implemented before the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that other structural flood relief works arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans due to be completed shortly under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme will start to be advanced in 2018 in a prioritised manner and be brought through the detailed design, planning and construction commencement stages in the period up to 2021.</p>  <p>  Within the overall allocation for flood risk management, the Office of Public Works will also continue in 2018 its very successful Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme where funding is provided to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems.  The Scheme was reviewed this year and, under new criteria, funding for eligible projects up to &euro;0.75m can be applied for by Local Authorities.  Over 600 projects have been approved for funding since the Scheme was introduced in 2009 which has brought protection to an estimated 6,000 properties approximately.  </p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to the programme of capital investment in the flood risk management area which will bring substantial benefit to thousands of households in the coming years throughout all parts of the country.</p></reply>

TLAC holds competitions for and advises, as appropriate, Ministers and/or the Government  on appointments to civil service posts at Secretary General and Assistant Secretary and equivalent levels.  </p>  <p>  The policy on open competitions for Assistant Secretary and for Secretary General and equivalent posts has been in place since 2011. </p>  <p>  In relation to recruitment to the wider public service, various Government Ministers, in accordance with the legislation setting up public service bodies or agencies under their aegis, are responsible for matters relating to senior appointments in those bodies. </p>  <p>  Clearly the public interest is usually best served by opening public service posts to the widest possible pool of suitably qualified candidates.  </p>  <p>  TLAC operates under the Code of Practice issued by the Commission for Public Service Appointments in accordance with the principles of merit, consistency, accountability, probity, best practice and professional confidentiality. </p>  <p>  TLAC operates in an independent manner and strictly on the basis of open competition and merit. TLAC is responsible for determining its own procedures and remit, subject to Government decisions as appropriate. </p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 8,000 or 2.7% on the 2016 outturn and an increase of over 25,000 or nearly 10% on 2014.</p>  <p>  The corresponding provision for the Exchequer pay bill in 2017 is &euro;16.47 billion.  This is an increase of approximately &euro;850 million on the 2016 outturn and approximately &euro;2 billion on the 2014 pay bill.</p>  <p>  In terms of the sectors specifically highlighted by the Deputy, in the health sector, at the end of June 2017, numbers stood at just under 111,000, an increase of just under 2,000 on the 2016 outturn. In relation to the Health Service Executive, there has been significant provision of additional staff in recent years, increasing by over 11,500 or 12% since 2013, of which approximately 90% would be front-line staff.  In the same period, staffing levels in the mental health service of the HSE have increased by 1,744 or nearly 20%.</p>  <p>  Much of the staffing dedicated to the area of housing is within the Local Authority sector where staffing allocations and resources are determined by the individual Local Authorities, with appropriate oversight by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Across both the Department and the Local Authorities, nearly 30,000 staff are currently engaged.</p>  <p>  Other Public Service staffing increases provided for in the 2017 Estimates include:</p>  <p>  - over 2,500 in the Education Sector, including additional teachers, resource teachers and SNAs;</p>  <p>  - an additional 500 Garda&iacute;, and a further 500 additional civilian staff; and</p>  <p>  - 400 additional staff in Children and Youth Affairs, including Tusla.</p>  <p>  Allocations related to staff increases will be provided in the context of Budget 2018 and will build on the significant increase in resources that have already been committed to support increased service delivery in recent years.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate the importance of ensuring that growth in public service numbers is achieved in a manner that supports the sustainability of both the public service pay bill and the overall fiscal position.  The Government's success in this regard is evident from the figures I have set out on the increased numbers of public servants employed in priority front-line service areas against the backdrop of continued improvements in key measures of fiscal performance.  </p></reply>

Consequently, it is not for me as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to set out a separate policy for public sector contracts.  </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that contracts are awarded to compliant businesses through the standard procedures contained in the procurement process.</p>  <p>  The public works contracts make provision for certain contractual remedies where the contractor&rsquo;s or their subcontractor&rsquo;s workers have not been paid in accordance with statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  The contracts also permit deductions to be made from payments in accordance with the legislation governing taxation.</p>  <p>  Health and Safety legislation is also underlined and enforced throughout the contract, enshrining legal requirements as conditions of contract so that serious health and safety breaches may be relied upon as breach of contract leading to termination.</p>  <p>  Payments under the public works contracts are in arrears and for work that is certified to have been carried out in accordance with the contract&rsquo;s requirements.  Such requirements must have regard to the Building Regulations.  Deductions may be made for non-compliant work and, depending on the nature and extent of the defect, failure to remedy same may lead to early termination.</p>  <p>  These are in addition to the remedies contained in law which are enforced by the appropriate statutory bodies who possess the necessary powers to investigate and to bring proceedings. </p></reply>

The impact of Brexit will depend on the outcome of the complex negotiations that are currently taking place. </p>  <p>  However, Ireland&rsquo;s economy is in a strong position to deal with this challenge.  Economic growth has become more firmly established in recent years, and our public finances remain on a path towards sustainability.  The period of 2015 to 2017 has seen an average annual increase in gross voted expenditure of 3 per cent.  This means that 2017 was the third successive year in which we were able to increase expenditure on public services and infrastructure.  The Summer Economic Statement, published earlier this year, set out planned average annual growth of gross voted expenditure of 3.5 per cent over the three year period 2018 to 2020. </p>  <p>  This Government&rsquo;s priority is to protect and consolidate the progress that has been made in recent years. In this context, expenditure has been allocated in 2017 to areas that may be significantly impacted by Brexit.  This includes support for our agrifood industry, through continued investment towards Foodwise 2025, as well as support for our rural and regional communities through funding for the Rural Development Programme and the Action Plan for Rural Development, which was published in January.

Work on the Spending Review began in January of this year and concluded in July, when I published the output of the Spending Review alongside the Mid-Year Expenditure Report.  The papers prepared for the Spending Review cover a wide range of policy areas and account for a significant proportion of current expenditure.  In total, 17 papers were produced by officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments.  In addition, an analysis of expenditure trends in key sectors was also published.  These papers are available on my Department's website at   </p><p>Unlike previous review processes, where the focus was on identifying spending reductions, the aim of this Spending Review process was to examine existing spending by reference to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and impact.  This approach allows for systematic examination of existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives and also to identify scope for re-allocating funding to meet expenditure priorities.  In this way, we can keep our focus on the totality of Government expenditure and ensure that we are achieving the best possible value for money for the taxpayer.</p><p>The spending review operates as a complementary process to the Budget Estimates process.  The Spending Review was undertaken over the first half of the year in order to enable the output of the review in each area to feed into the consideration of expenditure proposals for Estimates 2018.  The results of the Spending Review analysis provide a robust evidence base on key expenditure issues to inform ongoing discussions on Estimates proposals in the context of Budget 2018.  </p></reply>

My Department also made clear that proposals for additional capital spending should be aligned with the upcoming National Mitigation Plan and National Adaption Framework.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that there is a detailed governance framework already embedded in the allocation of capital resources through which significant investment decisions must be aligned with all government policies, including environmental policy.  The review of the Capital Plan will, therefore, ensure that resources continue to be allocated and aligned to support sustainable growth, as required under the Government's current policy framework. </p></reply>

The PSC sets out the rules and procedures that maintain Value for Money standards across the public service.  The PSC highlights the appraisal requirements for projects and programmes and provides central guidance on the application and evaluation methodologies including Cost Benefit Analysis.  The aim of this methodological guidance is to ensure consistency of approach across sectors. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the Department of Finance has strict guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation, the most recent of which were published in 2014 (2014 Guidelines for Tax Expenditure Evaluation).  These guidelines are informed by international best practice and represent the evaluation framework that the Department uses in considering proposals for a new tax expenditure or in reviewing an existing measure.  The evaluation questions contained in the guidelines are now applied to proposals for new tax reliefs (ex-ante evaluation) and to existing tax expenditures (ex-post evaluation).</p>  <p>  Examples of the ex-ante evaluation questions include identifying the market failure the tax expenditure is thought to address, the tax expenditure&rsquo;s likely economic impact and its expected costs.  Examples of the ex-post evaluation questions include identifying its actual cost, its actual economic impact and its continued relevance . For tax expenditures with an annual cost of more than &euro;50 million, the Guidelines provide for the undertaking of a cost-benefit analysis.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my officials are engaged in ongoing discussions with other Departments regarding the potential impacts of Brexit and how they might be best addressed.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in developing measures to support business through Brexit, engages in extensive stakeholder consultation and review of relevant research to build a strong understanding of the needs of businesses.  This work is carried out in collaboration with bodies such as SBCI, Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine.  In carrying out this work it is, of course, a priority to ensure that proposals for new measures are robust and can be assessed to deliver their objectives on a value-for-money basis.</p></reply>

This structural target is measured using the difference between government income and expenditure after one-off and cyclical elements of the public finances are accounted for.    </p>  <p>  In addition to the Structural Budget Balance (SBB) requirement, the Expenditure Benchmark comprises the second pillar of the Preventive Arm.  This is designed to assist Member States to reach or maintain their MTO by putting a limit on expenditure growth year-on-year.  Ireland is now required to limit expenditure growth in line with the medium term potential growth rate of the economy.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy objective is to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s MTO of a SBB of -0.5% in 2018 and further improvements in the headline General Government Balance (GBB) and SBB in the years ahead in order to strengthen the resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s public finances against external shocks such as Brexit.</p>  <p>  Following the onset of the economic and fiscal crisis there was a major retrenchment in public capital investment.  This is now being reversed.  An additional &euro;5.14 billion in Exchequer capital investment was originally committed in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement (SES) over the period of the Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021, with a further &euro;1.5 billion committed in the 2017 SES.</p>  <p>  Allowing for the &euro;2.2 billion of additional investment that the Government has already decided will be allocated for housing to support the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness and other commitments already made in Budget 2017, the Government has substantial additional Exchequer capital funding amounting to &euro;4.1 billion to allocate over the  four years 2018 - 2021 for increased public investment in Budget 2018, based on the assessment contained in the recently published review of the Capital Plan.  As confirmed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving from relatively low levels to among the highest in the EU. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this new planned level of capital investment represents an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment, the capacity of the economy to deliver additional public infrastructure consistent with fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability and the need to adhere to the responsible spending path agreed by Government with reference to the requirements of the EU Fiscal Rules.</p></reply>

Following on this study, Budget 2017 included a range of &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit ready&rsquo; measures targeted at the most exposed sectors.  These include measures to support SMEs, entrepreneurship, agrifood and Irish exporters. </p>  <p>  More recently, my Department has recently published a wider in-depth analysis of the possible sectoral impacts that Brexit may have on Ireland's trade relationship with the UK in comparison to the possible impacts in other EU Member States. </p>  <p>  As regards the overall macroeconomic strategy,  the best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  It is important also to recognise that the full impact of the UK's exit is only expected to materialise over time. As we cannot control the international environment, we will need to continue to improve our competitiveness, including by focusing on costs we can control, by boosting our productivity and ensuring sustainable public finances.  This approach is confirmed in the Summer Economic Statement which reaffirmed that improving the resilience of the economy against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty is the key focus of our macroeconomic strategy. Budget 2018 will continue to support prudent budgetary policy to help prepare for the economic risks that we face, including from Brexit. </p>  <p>  In terms of opportunities, Brexit will provide opportunities for Ireland to increase its share of financial services based inward investment. Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D. has responsibility for Financial Services, including the implementation of the dynamic and evolving IFS2020 Strategy for driving growth in the financial services sector.  The Government has also made an attractive bid for the European Banking Authority when it is relocated from the UK and will continue to leverage our IFS2020 Strategy to maximise opportunities arising as a result of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance will continue to carry out the necessary research, analysis and consultations, and to develop budgetary policy in the context of Brexit.</p></reply>

In order to ensure that tax from foreign REIT investors is retained in the State, the REIT tax legislation specifically provides that Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) would apply to REIT dividends at the standard rate of income tax of 20%. </p>  <p>  Non-resident investors who might otherwise be exempt from DWT do not have an exemption in respect of dividends paid by a REIT.  However, non-resident REIT investors from countries with which Ireland has a tax treaty may be able to reclaim some part of this DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.  The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source state would retain the right to a withholding tax of up 15% on dividends paid from that state. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that dividends amounting to &euro;23.9m in 2015, &euro;54.7m in 2016 and &euro;35.6m in 2017 (to August) were paid out by REITs.  No dividends were paid out prior to 2015.  DWT amounting to &euro;4.1m in 2015, &euro;8.5m in 2016 and &euro;5.3m in 2017 (to August) was collected in respect of dividends paid by REITs.  These figures include DWT relating to both resident and non-resident investors.  Due to the way in which investor details are returned it is not possible to separately identify DWT collected from non-resident investors only.  However, DWT amounting to &euro;68,000 in 2015, &euro;235,600 in 2016 and &euro;563,700 in 2017 (to August) was refunded to non-resident investors in respect of REIT dividends.</p></reply>

Specific criteria were set down in respect of the areas that should be included within the remit of the Living City Initiative which were required to be taken into account by the relevant city councils when putting forward the proposed Special Regeneration Areas for each city.  In particular, Special Regeneration Areas should be inner city areas which are largely comprised of dwellings built before 1915, where there is above average unemployment and which demonstrate clear evidence of neglect, dereliction and under-use. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department reviewed the Living City Initiative in 2016 in consultation with the relevant councils and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  On foot of that review, a number of changes were brought forward to the scheme in Budget 2017 in order to make the initiative more attractive and effective.  The principal change extended the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who are now able to claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property, which was built prior to 1915, where such property is to be used for residential purposes.  In addition, the requirement for a pre-1915 building to have been originally constructed for use as a dwelling in order to qualify for the residential element of the Initiative was removed.  The floor area restriction for owner-occupiers has also been removed, while the minimum amount of capital expenditure required for eligibility for relief, under all elements of the scheme, was also amended and must now only exceed &euro;5,000.  The possibility of extending the special regeneration areas was considered, but it was decided that such a change would dilute the incentive's potential impact on the originally targeted areas and that it would be better to get it working effectively before considering any further extension of the areas eligible.</p>  <p>  The review was included in the Report on Tax Expenditures (October 2016) that was published on Budget Day. </p></reply>

The basis for this inspection was a concern by the Commission that the companies involved may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in breach of EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant market position.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I am not in a position to make any comment in relation to any further measures being taken by the European Commission.  Any inspection or investigation being undertaken by the Commission is done independently of this Department and we have no insight into the development of any such exercise.</p>  <p>  However, the Department has taken an active role in tackling insurance costs.  The issue of rising insurance costs was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  Its report titled the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed time-frames, which are set out in an Action Plan. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The second such update was published on the Department's website on 21 July 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations, with a particular focus on the 17 action points which were due for completion in the second quarter of 2017. All 17 of these action points were completed by this deadline.  The third quarterly update will issue in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In addition, in January, the Cost of Insurance Working Group embarked on its second phase to examine issues around the cost of insurance for businesses, specifically employer and public liability insurance.  It is hoped that a final report will be published during the autumn/winter term. </p>  <p>  I believe that the implementation of these reports will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12-18 months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in motor insurance pricing in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for August) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 14% year-on-year.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  I am hopeful however that greater stability in pricing will continue to occur, and that premiums will continue to fall from the very high level of last year.</p></reply>

In carrying out these functions the Bank is required to act in an independent fashion and consequently I am not in a position to request it to direct some latitude to these groups regarding timelines for compliance.</p><p>It should be noted that section 33 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended, sets out the requirements in relation to customer due diligence (&lsquo;CDD&rsquo;).  Pursuant to section 33, designated persons, including banks, are required to identify the customer and verify the customer&rsquo;s identity on the basis of documents (whether or not in electronic form) or information which the designated person has reasonable grounds to believe can be relied upon to confirm the identity of the customer. </p><p>The legislation does not set out the CDD requirements to be carried out in relation to customers that are voluntary and community groups and as such designated persons will take a risk based approach to determining how they comply with section 33 in relation to those customers.</p><p>Guidelines on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing have been published which advise credit and financial institutions to take a risk-based approach in the following terms:</p><p>&ldquo;There may be circumstances where it is reasonable to delay discontinuing a business relationship while the designated person facilitates the customer&rsquo;s efforts to rectify the failure.  The reasonableness of such a delay will vary depending on the circumstances of each case.  Where a customer refuses to provide requested documentation or information then the business relationship should be discontinued once the customer has been warned of the potential implications and given time to respond accordingly&rdquo;.</p><p>In summary, banks are required to ensure that all of its customers provide them with the necessary anti-money laundering documentation as per section 33 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, however the guidelines referred to above do appear to give them some latitude as to the approach they adopt based on the circumstances of each case. </p></reply>

If it proves necessary to do so, I fully intend to make any order required to exclude any sector from the flat rate scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that they have engaged with all relevant players in the poultry sector to establish the detail and extent of such structures and contractual arrangements and to establish if they plan to unwind any structures and arrangements that could give rise to overcompensation of farmers for the VAT borne on their input costs.  I also understand that following undertakings to change important elements of the business model employed in the sector,  Revenue will now evaluate if systematic overcompensation of flat rate farmers in the sector could still arise, which is still a risk given the nature of some of the contractual arrangements that are a feature of the sector.  If Revenue&rsquo;s evaluation finds that there is still an excess of flat rate addition payments to farmers in the sector over the VAT borne on their input costs, they will prepare a report for my office as provided for in Section 86A of the VAT Consolidation Act, 2010 (inserted by Section 47 of Finance Act 2016). </p>  <p>  In relation to other agricultural sectors, I am advised by Revenue that they are conscious of the risks and are actively looking for indications of the emergence of similar structures and contractual arrangements in other agricultural sectors and have discussed this matter with the Irish Farmers Association. </p>  <p>  With regard to your question in relation to the European Commission, Ireland responded to a number of questions raised by the Commission on the application of the Flat-Rate Scheme for Farmers in the agricultural sector in Ireland.  The Commission closed this file in February 2017.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.</p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced. Payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants.</p>  <p>  In this regard, an Order was granted in the High Court on Monday 24 July 2017 in relation to 324 claims which were subsequently paid by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  The Liquidator has informed the Department that, as of 31 August 2017, there are 1,576 active claims, of which 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%/&euro;825,000 limits. </p>  <p>  The Liquidator is currently working on the next batch of claims to be included in the next application to the High Court scheduled to be made in February 2018 in accordance with the legislation.  It is hoped that a significant proportion of the claims who have yet to receive any payment will be paid compensation subject to the ICF limits at this time.  However, it is important to note that in some instances there may still be ongoing claim settlement discussions between the liquidator and third party claimants which means that such people will not be paid until the first scheduled payment date after formal sign off by both parties.</p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process.  However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to.  In this regard, a preliminary assessment was carried out by Towers Watson in 2014 who indicated that the Liquidator would not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims out of the assets of the liquidation. The Liquidator has subsequently informed the Department that as the Supreme Court has now made its judgment, a new actuarial report is being commissioned.  This is expected to be completed in Q4 2017.</p></reply>

This is in keeping with the general scheme of the taxation of the returns on financial products where non-residents are not subject to Irish tax.  For example deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) does not apply to deposit interest earned by non-residents and exit tax does not apply to non-residents who invest in investment undertakings.  </p>  <p>  In addition, under Ireland&rsquo;s double tax treaties there is a restriction on the amount of tax that could be withheld on interest payments to residents of our double tax treaty partners.  Some agreements provide for no withholding, while others provide for withholding up to a maximum of 5% to 15%.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the costing included in the &ldquo;Cost of Tax Allowances, Credits, Exemptions and Reliefs&rdquo; is the maximum cost of the exemption.  It is calculated as 20% of the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s figures for interest payments.  It therefore does not take account of the effect that double tax agreements would have on Ireland&rsquo;s right to tax on those interest payments.</p></reply>

At the time of Budget 2017 my Department estimated that the Help-to-Buy incentive would cost &euro;40 million per annum for 2018 and 2019 and &euro;50 million in 2017 due to the back-dating of the relief in respect of properties which became eligible for the incentive between 19 July 2016 and the end of that year. Currently, these estimates remain valid.</p><p>To avail of the incentive involves two stages. Stage 1 is the application stage, wherein prospective applicants can query whether they qualify for the incentive.  They can also get clarity on the maximum amount of rebate they could potentially benefit from, based on their tax paid in a four-year period. Stage 2 is the claims stage, wherein applicants that decide to proceed with purchasing or building a qualifying property must provide documentary evidence of the relevant property transaction or their mortgage draw down.</p><p>The estimates for the potential cost of the incentive that have featured in recent media reports are based on the number of applications received by Revenue to stage 1 of the scheme, rather than the number of claims to date.  However, many of these applicants may never make a claim to stage 2 for a variety of reasons.  These could include individuals who do not go on to obtain mortgage approval, who may decide to purchase a second-hand property, or who are not able to source the new home that they desire.</p><p>As of 31 August 2017 Revenue has received 9,629 applications to stage 1 of the Help-to-Buy incentive; of these, 6,626 have been approved. 3,625 stage 2 claims have been created to date; of these 2,998 have been approved.

The VAT rate applicable to the servicing and repair of motor vehicles is the reduced rate 13.5% and under the Directive the rate applicable to such services cannot be reduced below 12%.

The published estimates provide information such as output, input costs, gross and net value added and operating surplus.  A breakdown of items of expenditure such as feed, electricity, fuel, maintenance and repair, etc. is estimated from the National Farm Survey (NFS) where the average expenses per farm is available by type and size of farm.  This information is used to estimate the apportionment of expenditure across different expenditure types.  Additional adjustments are made to account for VAT registered farmers and VAT refunded to VAT unregistered farmers. </p><p>The flat rate addition is designed to compensate VAT unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on the purchases of goods and services.  VAT unregistered farmers add this percentage to their prices when selling to VAT registered businesses (co-ops, meat factories, etc.) who treat the flat rate amount as a normal business input in their periodic VAT returns.</p><p>In accordance with Article 298 of the EU VAT Directive the maximum level of the flat rate addition is calculated annually based on an average of the last three years rates.  It is open to the Member State to decide what flat rate level to apply but it has been the policy of successive Governments in Ireland to grant full compensation.  The flat rate statistics for each of the relevant three years pertaining to the 5.4% rate as calculated ahead of Budget 2017 were as follows:<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Flat Rate %</th></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>5.34</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>5.35</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>5.53</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>5.4</td></tr></table></p><p>The statistics which underpin these rates are continually subject to review in the context of annual reviews relating to VAT Own Resources.

If implemented successfully, the improvement programmes, in tandem with the economic recovery, were projected to contribute some additional &euro;700m in collections for the exchequer over the three years 2016, 2017 and 2018. </p><p>The additional money targeted for collection was calculated by deducting the 2013 collection rate (%) from the current year collection rate (%), and multiplying this by the total amount estimated available for collection in the projected year.  For example, in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in 2013 the collection rate was 56%, the 2016 collection rate was targeted at 78%.  Multiplying this 22% difference by the estimated total amount available for collection (&euro;115m) in 2016 equalled &euro;25.3m.  This methodology was used as the total amount available for collection can vary significantly each year.  Collection rates can exceed 100% due to the collection of prior years&rsquo; arrears.  </p><p>The projected additional targeted collection amounts for each of the five in-scope public service bodies are set out in Table 1.</p><p><b>Table 1: Projected additional amounts (&euro; million) to be collected in 2016-2018</b><table><tr><th>Body </th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection</td><td>25.3</td><td>25.3</td><td>25.3</td><td>75.9</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</td><td>0.14</td><td>0.23</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.59</td></tr><tr><td>Courts Service</td><td>0.39</td><td>0.39</td><td>0.39</td><td>1.17</td></tr><tr><td>Health Service Executive</td><td>6.52</td><td>7.16</td><td>7.82</td><td>21.5</td></tr><tr><td>Local Authority Rates</td><td>150.03</td><td>208.15</td><td>269.62</td><td>627.8</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>182.38</td><td>241.23</td><td>303.35</td><td>726.96</td></tr></table></p><p>Projected collection amounts for 2016, including the projected collection rates, are set out in Table 2 alongside the actual amounts collected in 2016.  Final figures for 2016 are not yet available for all five of the public service bodies who participated in this project as detailed below.</p><p><b>Table 2: Projected and Actual amounts collected (&euro; million) 2016</b><table><tr><th>Body</th><th>Projected Available for Collection</th><th>Projected Collection Rate</th><th>Total Projected Collection</th><th>Actual Available for Collection</th><th>Actual Collection Rate</th><th>Actual Total Collection</th></tr><tr><td>Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection</td><td>115.0</td><td>78%</td><td>90.0</td><td>115.0</td><td>71%</td><td>82.0</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</td><td>21.0</td><td>96%</td><td>20.2</td><td>24.9</td><td>93%</td><td>23.2</td></tr><tr><td>Courts Service</td><td>14</td><td>89%</td><td>12.46</td><td>15.5</td><td>68%</td><td>10.5</td></tr><tr><td>Health Service Executive</td><td>50</td><td>92%</td><td>46</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Local Authority Rates</td><td>1,735.33</td><td>84%</td><td>1,457.68</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr></table></p><p>Courts Service</p><p>As identified in the Final Report of the Debt Management Implementation Project Board (pages 35-38 and page 78), the Courts Service has embarked on a fundamental change of approach to the collection of court imposed fines arising from the implementation of the Fines (Payment and Collection) Act 2014.  This Act came into effect in January 2016 and has introduced a number of new approaches to the collection of fines, including the option to pay by installment, attachment to earnings and community service.  None of these options were available previously.</p><p>In effect, the Courts Service is in a transition period at present as not all aspects of the new legislation have taken effect yet.  The time period to pay a fine has in effect been extended considerably compared with the previous situation, and as such the amount of fines collected in 2016 is, as expected, below the level collected in previous years.  Taking account of the new arrangements, it is to be expected that there would be some drop off in the collection rate in the period immediately after the commencement of the new arrangements.</p><p>As stated in the report it will take approximately two years before the Courts Service can properly assess the impact of the new arrangements.  For this reason it is not possible, at this point, to assess any savings that can be achieved, or other impacts of the new legislation.</p><p>Health Service Executive</p><p>The Finance function of the Health Service Executive is consulting hospitals to ascertain the total 2016 figure equivalent to the projected collection of statutory inpatient charges and emergency department charges.  The figure will be provided to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p><p>Local Authority Rates</p><p>The achievement of the 2016 targets for the local authorities will be assessed when the 2016 audited Annual Financial Statements of the local authorities are available.  2016 figures will be provided to the Deputy as soon as they are available.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  </p><p>The EU Directives on public procurement require that public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds (exclusive of VAT) must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria.  For works contracts, the threshold is &euro;5.225 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments, the threshold is &euro;135,000 and for the remainder of public bodies, the threshold is &euro;209,000.  The new EU Directives also introduced a simplified award regime (a &ldquo;light-touch&rdquo; regime) for certain services, notably health, social, educational and cultural services where the threshold is &euro;750,000.  </p><p>In relation to tendering procedures, there are six types potentially available to contracting authorities in awarding contracts.  the Open Procedure; the Restricted Procedure, the Competitive Dialogue procedure; the Competitive Procedure with Negotiation procedure; the Innovation Partnership procedure; and the Negotiated Procedure without Prior Publication procedure.  The choice of procedure will vary depending on the nature and circumstances of each contract.  The Open Procedure is the most commonly used procedure.</p><p>For contracts or purchases below the EU threshold levels, the following national guidelines apply:</p><p>- contracts for goods and services with an estimated value of less than &euro;5,000 (exclusive of VAT) to be awarded on the basis of  verbal quotes from one or more competitive suppliers (best practice is to seek a minimum of 3 quotes confirmed by e-mail);</p><p>- contracts for goods and services with an estimated value between &euro;5,000 and &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT)  to be awarded on the basis of responses to written specifications (e.g. sent by email) to at least three suppliers or service providers;</p><p>- contracts for goods and or services, with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) and up to the value of the EU thresholds should normally be advertised as part of a formal tendering process on eTenders using the Open Procedure in line with DPER Circular 10/14.</p><p>Full details of public procurement procedures (both EU  and National) can be found in the guidelines.</p></reply>

Gross current voted expenditure of &euro;34,417 million was &euro;168 million below profile at end-August, but up 3.8% year-on-year. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;2,158 million at end-August was &euro;38 million below profile, but up 20.8% year-on-year. </p><p>In relation to the adequacy of budgetary provisions for 2017, the Deputy will be aware that 2017 was third consecutive year in which we were able to increase public spending. As set out in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, total gross voted expenditure for 2017 is estimated at &euro;58.1 billion.  This is an increase of &euro;1.9 billion compared to 2016. Along with funding for demographics and other expenditure pre-commitments, this increase allowed for additional allocations for staffing in the health, justice and education sectors, increases in weekly Social Welfare rates and progression of the Action Plan for Housing.  As I stated previously, all expenditure is subject to careful monitoring to ensure that it is being managed effectively and delivers public services on a value-for-money basis.</p><p>Public Service Reform continues to be a key feature of my Department's policy.  Considerable progress has been made since the first Public Service Reform Plan was published in 2011.  Five progress reports on Public Service Reform have been published to date.  The most recent progress report is the Final Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-16 and was published in July 2017 alongside an OECD Assessment of the Plan and two case studies on reform (on INTREO and the Office of Government Procurement).  These publications coincided with the launch of a Public Consultation on the next phase of reform.  All documents are available on<i>www.reformplan.per.gov.ie</i></p><p>We are now moving from a stage of reform to one of development and continuous improvement which will cover the period to 2020.  My Department is currently developing a new Public Service Development and Innovation Framework, Our Public Service 2020.  This will set out a series of actions to be delivered out to 2020 which will both build on the achievements of the last six years and respond to new challenges.  Our Public Service 2020 aims to deliver better outcomes for the public and to build more responsive and agile public service organisations.  It identifies a series of actions grouped under three pillars: Delivering for our Public; Innovating for our Future; and Developing our People and Organisations.  This next phase of public service reform is due to be launched before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Considerable progress has been made since the first Public Service Reform Plan was published in 2011.  We are now moving from a stage of reform to one of development and continuous improvement which will cover the period to 2020.  My Department is currently developing a new Public Service Development and Innovation Framework, Our Public Service 2020.  This will set out a series of actions to be delivered out to 2020 which will both build on the achievements of the last six years and respond to new challenges. </p><p>Our Public Service 2020 will have a particular emphasis on quality service for the customer.  We aim to place the customer's needs at the core of every decision from policy formulation to service design through to the service delivery.  The framework will focus on increasing access, enabling better delivery and engagement with our customers using new tools such as increased digitisation, increasing accessibility of services and better data-sharing. </p><p>The approach of the framework will be underpinned by the principles of evidence, flexibility, inclusion, outcomes focus and evaluation and review.  These will ensure a continued focus on quality service for the customer and on value for money.  There will be a strengthened effort to move from an emphasis on outputs and processes to focus on outcomes and impact.  Regular evaluation and review with indicators measuring whether the aims of the plan are on target will ensure we measure progress. </p><p>Ensuring value for the taxpayer is an important element of public expenditure management.  In July this year I published the output of the spending review.  The papers prepared for the Spending Review cover a wide range of policy areas and account for a significant proportion of current expenditure.  In total, 17 papers were produced by officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments.  In addition, an analysis of expenditure trends in key sectors was also published.  This was the first in a planned series of 'rolling' selective reviews that will take place each year to 2019.  The aim of the Spending Review process was to examine existing spending by reference to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and impact.  This approach allows for systematic examination of existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives and also to identify scope for reallocating funding to meet expenditure priorities. In this way, we can ensure that value for money is achieved for every euro of public funding spent. </p><p>As the Deputy may already be aware, in July my colleague Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan launched the following four public service reform initiatives:</p><p>1. The final report on the implementation of the 2014-16 Public Service Reform Plan which reflects on reforms implemented during that period, highlighting a wide range of improved services for the public and savings across a range of projects.  The report showed that almost 90% of the 227 actions in the plan were on target or completed.</p><p>2. The of the 2014-16 Public Service Reform Plan which was undertaken with a view to informing future public service reform efforts.  The OECD Assessment acknowledges the achievements made and identifies the key areas where public service reform needs to focus on going forward.</p><p>3. The first ever on public service reform which was carried out in preparation for the third phase of the Plan.  Our Public Service 2020 &ndash; Development and Innovation Framework.  The framework aims to deliver better outcomes for the public and to build more responsive and agile public service organisations.  It identifies a series of actions grouped under the following three pillars:</p><p>1. Delivering for our Public</p><p>2. Innovating for our Future</p><p>3. Developing our People and Organisations</p><p>Two case-studies on recent major reform projects; the creation of the and the establishment of the one-stop-shop service for job-seekers.  These address a gap in access to public service case studies to date, and are educational resources for free use in third-level and public policy environments.</p><p>The four initiatives reflect well on the progress on reform to date, across the public service and show how we are using past experience to inform the next phase of reform, which is due to be launched before the end of the year.

All Departments will provide profiles for how this expenditure will be allocated across the year.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the Summer Economic Statement 2017, published in July, the Government will invest a further &euro;4.1 billion in key infrastructure supporting economic and social progress over the period 2018-2021.  This is in addition to the extra &euro;2.2b in Exchequer funding already allocated to housing under Rebuilding Ireland. </p>  <p>  Consequently between 2014 and 2021 public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will see public investment in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this new planned level of capital investment represents an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment, the capacity of the economy to deliver additional public infrastructure consistent with fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability and the need to adhere to the responsible spending path agreed by Government with reference to the requirements of the EU Fiscal Rules.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the delivery of the Capital Plan as published in 2015 is proceeding and while the position in relation to any individual project is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant responsible Minister, the review of the Capital Plan which I published on 14 September, includes an update for each Department setting out the progress already being made in delivering the Capital Plan.  A copy of the Review has been supplied to all Deputies.

The fragmented procurement arrangements across the public service which existed prior to this facilitated among other things suppliers charging different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services.  This was not sustainable, as the State could not afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermined the efficient delivery of services.</p>  <p>  All public bodies are keenly aware of the importance of maximising the value for money achievable when procuring any commonly acquired goods or services.  The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have been designed to optimise benefits to the public service through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.    </p>  <p>  Central procurement frameworks are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  In this regard, public bodies are encouraged to use these frameworks arrangements.  The benefits arising from these central procurement frameworks include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; enhanced service levels and legal certainty.  It is Government policy, as set out in Circular 16/2013, that public bodies, where possible, should make use of all such central arrangements.  Where public bodies choose not to use central procurement frameworks they should be in a position to provide a value for money justification.  It should also be noted that the OGP issued Circular 10/2014 which contains initiatives aimed at facilitating SME access to public contracts. </p>  <p>  The State spends around &euro;12 billion on goods, works and services each year.  This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the public service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.  Developing a strategic approach to public procurement means that the state can deliver much needed public service in a sustainable manner. </p>  <p>  While each procurement arrangement is different, each and every procurement competition must adhere to the rules and timelines prescribed in the relevant regulations.  Notwithstanding this the professional service provided by the OGP enables the delivery of compliant arrangements within the most expeditious time frame possible.  In particular, availing of OGP Frameworks offers a shorter timeframe than running standalone competitions.  In terms of delivery of the OGP's programme of work, the OGP Schedule of Frameworks and Contracts sets out the OGP's service delivery plan for Q2 2017 to Q1 2018 and provides details of when key contracts and frameworks will be available for use by public sector bodies.  The Schedule has been published to inform public sector bodies and suppliers.  The Schedule is updated on a quarterly basis so that a rolling nine-month forward view is visible.</p>  <p>  Ireland's procurement reform programme has been successful in establishing new structures and building momentum.  The OGP is continuing to refine the model in order to strengthen and improve it, in line with the Programme for Government commitments.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that I published the Review of the Capital Plan on the 14th of September, and a copy of the report was made available to each Deputy on that day.</p><p>The Review draws on an evidence base that included detailed submissions by Departments and Offices, an extensive public consultation, as well as an Infrastructure Capacity and Demand Analysis completed by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>My Department has also published a range of supporting documentation, including Departmental submissions, which underpin the evidence base of the Review.  Copies of the documentation can be found at <i>www.per.gov.ie. </i></p><p>Based on the analysis, the review of the Capital Plan has identified a number of key sectors as priorities for investment, including transport, education and housing.  These findings provide a detailed evidence base which will assist Government in making decisions, in the context of the 2018 Estimates, on the allocation of the &euro;4.1 billion of additional funding now available for allocation over the period 2018 to 2021.  Reflecting this significant planned increase in public capital investment, between 2014 and 2021 public capital expenditure in Ireland will have more than doubled and as set out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, this will result in public investment in Ireland moving to among the highest in the EU.</p><p>From a longer-term perspective, the review of the Capital Plan will also provide a significant input into the development of the proposed new 10 year National Investment Plan, to be published in conjunction with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government&rsquo;s new National Planning Framework (NPF) - the objectives of which are fundamental to the achievement of long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability. </p><p>I am satisfied that this new planned level of capital investment represents an appropriate balance between the need for additional investment, the capacity of the economy to deliver additional public infrastructure consistent with overall fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability and the need to adhere to the responsible spending path agreed by Government with reference to the requirements of the EU Fiscal Rules.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p><p>Students who have significant care needs requirements are therefore granted access to SNA support, whereby a quantum of SNA support is allocated to a school, which is reflective of the assessed individual needs of a group of identified children.  Those SNAs will then be in a position to cater for the care needs of those designated pupils, as the need arises, and as they require assistance, with the level of support being provided reflecting actual need at any given time. </p><p>A key aspiration for pupils with special educational needs is that they will, on completion of their school-based education, be able to graduate as young independent adults in so far as this is possible.  There is therefore a need to balance the support provided in schools with each pupil&rsquo;s right to acquire personal independence skills.  As such, in order to give those pupils every opportunity possible to develop independent living skills, the assistive SNA support which is given to them should always be at the minimum level required to meet the care needs of the pupil.</p><p>The NCSE advised all schools of their allocations for SNA support for the coming 2017/18 school year on 6th July 2017.  Details of SNA allocations which have been made to schools have been published by the NCSE on their website at  .  </p><p>The level of SNA support allocated to all schools can change from year to year, as students with care needs leave the school, as new students with care needs enrol, or as students develop more independent living skills as they get older and their care needs diminish over time. </p><p>Where a school has received its allocation of SNA support for 2017/18, but wishes new enrolments or assessments to be considered, which were not taken into account when the initial allocation was made, they may continue to make applications to the NCSE.</p><p>In circumstances where a school, or parent, is unhappy with the allocation of SNA support which has been made, or considers the level of support allocated is not sufficient to meet the care needs of the pupils concerned, the school or parent, may appeal that decision via the NCSE appeals process.  Details of the NCSE appeals process is available at ; the closing date for receipt of appeals is the 29th September 2017.</p></reply>

In identifying the requirement for additional school places, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, on foot of the last nationwide demographic exercises, the establishment of four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools to open in 2017 and 2018 was announced.  A number of these schools were announced as regional solutions to serve a number of school planning areas under increased demographic pressure, including the new post-primary school announced to serve the Carpenterstown and Castleknock school planning areas in Dublin 15, which opened in September 2017 in interim accommodation at the Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School in Tyrellstown.</p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in a school planning area(s), a patronage process is conducted to decide who will operate the school. Parental preferences for each patron from parents of children who reside in the school planning area(s) are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area(s), rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.  The Department&rsquo;s focus is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places within that school planning area(s).</p></reply>

This was appealed by my Department to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but subsequently withdrawn to facilitate submission to the local authority of an amended outline planning permission in 2013, which was also refused on similar grounds. </p>  <p>  This decision was appealed by my Department to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but was refused.  However, the Board considered that the matter of assessing alternative means of accessing these lands would benefit from a co-ordinated approach by my Department and the local authority in the interests of achieving a comprehensive and balanced solution to ongoing access issues on this educational campus. </p>  <p>  This is a complex planning issue and my Department is in ongoing contact with the relevant parties, including meeting with the local authority and third-party landowners on a number of occasions, with a view to finding an acceptable solution to the access issue.

The EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, raised the matter during bilateral meetings with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on 24 April and 11 July. On both occasions, HR Mogherini highlighted the serious concerns of the European Union and its Member States over the allegations and urged the Russian government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the rights of the gay community in Chechnya and elsewhere in the country are respected, in line with Russia&rsquo;s international human rights commitments.   </p></reply>

In the last six months alone, the cholera epidemic has killed more than 2,000 people and infected nearly 700,000 others, many of whom are children.  Yet, due to ongoing attacks and lack of critical supplies, only 45% of health facilities are functioning.</p>  <p>  The extent of the crisis in Yemen is a source of deep concern, particularly given its devastating impact on the Yemeni people.  Since 2012 Ireland has provided over &euro;11 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen, with &euro;4 million provided this year to meet the commitment we made at the High-level Pledging Event for Yemen in April.  This funding provides rapid and flexible funding to NGOs and UN agencies to deliver services on the ground, including health, water and sanitation, and nutrition interventions. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also providing &euro;20 million annually over a three year period (2016-2018) to the World Food Programme (WFP).  Last month, WFP reached nearly seven million people in Yemen with monthly food assistance as well as specialized nutrition supplements to treat and prevent malnourishment among women and children.  Our core funding of &euro;9.5 million in 2017 to the International Committee of the Red Cross supports the organisation&rsquo;s work in Yemen, where it is providing support to health facilities and on-site training to medical and administrative personnel in dedicated cholera treatment units.  Ireland is also the 8th largest contributor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which has allocated $84.8 million to Yemen since 2015. </p>  <p>  Conflict is at the root of this crisis and Ireland supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who continue to work towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict.  Ireland has also been consistent in calling for an impartial, international investigation into alleged violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and human rights law by any party to the conflict in Yemen, including at the UN Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  Together with our EU and UN partners, we will continue to monitor the situation closely and to work internationally for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. </p></reply>

At that time, my Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law.  </p>  <p>  In England and Wales, for example, difficulties arising in connection with high trees or hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.  This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high. Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012. </p>  <p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and overhanging trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland indicates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort.  This is intended to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between adjoining property owners and ill-feeling in the local community.  </p>  <p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person concerned would have to show that an easement existed and that there had been a substantial interference with that right. </p>  <p>  The Mediation Bill 2017, which will shortly complete its passage through the Oireachtas, does not deal directly with the issue of overhanging trees and high hedges.  However, it seeks to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings.  The enactment of the Bill will contribute to the resolution of disputes by means of mediation, thereby reducing legal costs associated with such disputes and avoiding the stress involved in adversarial court proceedings.</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  The Department of Justice and Equality continues to engage with the Department of Health to assist with that work, but there is still some work to be done. </p>  <p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s not having ratified the CRPD is a recurring point of criticism by the UN as well as by domestic civil society and NGOs, it should be noted that in terms of quality of service and the actual position of people with disabilities in society, Ireland is in many respects in advance of other EU states.  This is not to be complacent and we are continuing to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published earlier this year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-26a.390.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600066#WRJ00400"><p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  The Department of Justice and Equality continues to engage with the Department of Health to assist with that work, but there is still some work to be done. </p>  <p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s not having ratified the CRPD is a recurring point of criticism by the UN as well as by domestic civil society and NGOs, it should be noted that in terms of quality of service and the actual position of people with disabilities in society, Ireland is in many respects in advance of other EU states.  This is not to be complacent and we are continuing to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published earlier this year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations.  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and the Government recently published a new National Disability Inclusion Strategy (2017 &ndash; 2021). This strategy contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister. </p></reply>

Since the direct provision system was established in 2000 some 60,000 persons have benefited from these services, and some deaths of residents have occurred in this period. </p>  <p>  While overseeing the delivery of different services, my Department has no direct role in the provision of health or health related services to protection applicants.  Such services are provided through the Department of Health by the Health Service Executive (HSE) via hospital, primary care and the GP services.  Protection applicants receive these health services on exactly the same basis as Irish or EU citizens who have medical cards.  All health matters are private between a patient and his or her medical advisor and records in relation to any illness, including mental illness are, properly, not available to Departmental staff.  Similarly, when persons in the protection process die, their deaths are treated by medical personnel and/or the coroner in exactly the same way as any other person who passes away within the jurisdiction of the State.  The same procedures apply to protection applicants as to other persons who are not protection applicants.</p>  <p>  While my Department collates some statistics on deaths of persons in the protection process, this is usually by way of a general knowledge of the cause of death, such as by way of information arising from the specified medical needs of the resident concerned.  In most cases, the deaths would have occurred outside of State-provided accommodation e.g. in hospitals or hospices.  Official records in relation to deaths are maintained by the Register of Births Marriages and Deaths (HSE).  The Department has no access to death certificates, nor would it be appropriate under data protection safeguards for it to seek such access, and it is therefore not possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The reports of these inspections are published on the RIA website.  Centres are also subject to inspection by various other State agencies including for example Environmental Health Officers.  The Reception and Integration Agency has implemented a number of policies in all centres dealing with such issues as child protection, sexual and gender based violence and a code of practice for persons working in accommodation centres. </p>  <p>  The issue of Garda vetting and child protection in RIA centres is taken very seriously.  RIA has a dedicated Child and Family Services Unit, whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and Tusla, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  The Unit is headed up by an official seconded from Tusla who has clinical expertise in the area of child welfare and protection. </p>  <p>  RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy and Practice Document is based on the HSE's &ldquo;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children.  In relation to training of staff in centres, the HSE/Tusla has provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training and Designate Liaison Person Training [DLP] to each centre's Designated Liaison Persons and other staff members.  RIA has recently updated  its Child Protection Policy to include a Practice Document.  To communicate this policy, briefing sessions were held in family centres around the country for centre staff members and all other relevant personnel.  The policy is available on www.ria.gov.ie   </p>  <p>  I am advised that all staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted and the remit of the Ombudsman, and the Ombudsman for Children, has been extended to cover those who are living in State provided accommodation since April 2017. </p></reply>

Some key ICT projects which are being advanced in this regard are as follows:</p>  <p>  - a new Investigations Management system which will support the management of activities completed as part of an investigation, maintain a full history of the chain of events in an investigation, manage information gathered, and decisions/actions taken;</p>  <p>  - a new Property and Exhibits Management System which will be used to record all property and exhibits which come into Garda possession and manage them throughout their lifecycle within the organisation from scene to court;</p>  <p>  - a new Enterprise Content Management System which will provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a single enterprise content repository for all documentation and multimedia content created;</p>  <p>  - in the area of Victims Services PULSE has been updated to include Individual Victim Assessment and Victim Engagement screens to record information about the victim themselves and any Garda interaction or engagement with the victim;</p>  <p>  - a new e-Vetting system is now operational which provides online processing of applications for Garda vetting for persons working with children and vulnerable persons;</p>  <p>  - a new Rosters and Duty Management System which will support the management of the new rosters in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to manage the deployment of human resources on a day to day and also on a strategic long term basisa new Anti-Money Laundering application will support Financial Intelligence Units to counter Terrorist Financing and Money Laundering;</p>  <p>  - an updated Intrusion Prevention and Detection System will add an additional layer of security to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s security architecture by proactively identifying potential threats and having policies in place to act upon them.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also, in collaboration with the Department of Justice and Equality, actively progressing a number of EU ICT Projects to improve police co-operation and increase border security within the EU Community.  These include implementation of :</p>  <p>  - the FIND solution to enable the Garda National Immigration Bureau to query the Interpol Stolen Lost Travel Document Database;</p>  <p>  - implementation of PRUM which will deliver enhancements to the Automated Finger Printing System to step up cross-border cooperation in relation to terrorism, crime and illegal immigration;</p>  <p>  - implementation of the Schengen Information System to enable the rapid dissemination of information pertaining to terrorist threats and other subversive and non-subversive crime types across members states of the European Union;</p>  <p>  - implementation of ADEP (Automated Data Exchange Process) which will allow searching of other member states criminal records on name, address, date and place of birth, on a hit/no hit basis;</p>  <p>  - implementation of PNR (Passenger Name Record) requirements which require air carriers to provide advance passenger data to Immigration authorities.  This data can be used for risk analysis by various state agencies;</p>  <p>  - implementation of API (Advanced Passenger Information) requirements which require air carriers to provide advance passenger data to Immigration authorities.  This data can be used for risk analysis by various state agencies. API data is basic information that includes name, date of birth, gender, citizenship, and travel document data (e.g. passport number).</p>  <p>  In addition, a project to enhance network access to rural Garda stations is being progressed and is well advanced.</p>  <p>  Further, I understand that the Garda mobility strategy, which aims to ensure that Garda members have remote access to information and technology, is progressing.  When fully implemented, access by members to real-time information on mobile devices, as well as enabling investigation teams to collect and share information digitally, will improve the effectiveness of the service provided to communities. Indeed, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the ACTIVE Mobility programme, to be delivered over the next 3 to 5 years, will result in frontline Garda&iacute; having more connectivity to back office systems harnessing the power of mobile technology.  I understand from Garda authorities that an initial pilot of the programme will take place in the Limerick Division commencing in Q4 2017.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Reserve was established in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enhance the links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and consists of voluntary unpaid members, drawn from the community, to support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Reserve perform policing duties as determined by the Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;.  Their role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas.  Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;.  In recent years, the Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.</p>  <p>  The "Programme for a Partnership Government" includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  In line with this the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves and that process is well underway.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing.  To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion before the end of this year.  As a first step the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve from the Human Resource and People Development Directorate to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement.  This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens.  This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground engaging with local communities.</p>  <p>  The review will take cognisance of the changed environment in which the expanded Reserve will operate as the major reform programme that is underway is implemented.  These reforms include the  drive towards a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021 to boost the management capacity of the organisation and to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties, and also the phased implementation of the Divisional model of policing to enable resources to be deployed more efficiently to prevent and detect crime.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in relation to these matters. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware, however, that this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace. I am informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year, which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  The College provides a range of training and development courses to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all new recruits complete their initial 32 week training programme there. The physical capacity of the College extends to some 496 bedrooms, 16 Classrooms and 4 Lecture Theatres.  The Garda authorities inform me that the College has the capacity to accommodate the planned intakes of Garda trainees.</p>  <p>  While a number of new facilities were built at the College in the early 2000s, including new administration, catering and recreation facilities, a major programme of works to improve fire safety at the accommodation blocks at the College has been undertaken by the Office of Public Works. </p>  <p>  In the context of the longer-term planning for the College, I understand that the Garda authorities are, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, developing proposals for a new purpose-built education and training facility and additional residential accommodation for use by trainee Garda&iacute;. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are trained to the highest standard and have the opportunity to avail of ongoing professional development training so that they can continue to provide a 21st century policing service that meets the expectations of our communities. </p></reply>

As Minister, I have no role in the matter. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. </p>  <p>  At its meeting on 13 June 2017, the Government noted the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s interim Report in this regard, which analysed population and crime trends and the availability of stations for possible reuse. The report contained a recommendation that the former Stepaside station in Co. Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis and indicated that, subject to further analysis, the Commissioner is likely to recommend in the final report the inclusion of the former stations at Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow and Donard, Co. Wicklow in the pilot scheme.  If a second station is to be reopened in Dublin, the Report indicates that the Commissioner is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend that the former station at Rush, Co. Dublin be included in the pilot scheme.</p>  <p>  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is liaising with the Office of Public Works in relation to the proposed reopening of the former Garda station at Stepaside.

All three reports are available to view on my Department's website www.justice.ie.  </p>  <p>  The final progress report shows that 133 recommendations have been reported as fully implemented and a further 36 are in progress or partially implemented.  This represents a 98% full or partial implementation.</p>  <p>  The Direct Provision system was established in 2000 when the then health boards, which were responsible for homeless people, found themselves unable to cope with a large number of individuals who were claiming asylum in Ireland.  Direct Provision is the system whereby State services are delivered directly to protection applicants through the relevant Government Department or Agency.  In the case of my Department, full board accommodation is offered to applicants while their application for international protection is being processed.  Not every person who seeks international protection in Ireland chooses to accept the offer of full board accommodation and of course many chose to live with colleagues, family or friends in communities across the country, as they are entitled to do.</p>  <p>  If the system was simply disbanded, already vulnerable people who we are responsible for protecting would join the lengthy waiting lists for social housing or enter the private rental market with little hope of finding affordable and secure accommodation in the context of the current housing crisis.  The Direct Provision system is a guarantee that every person who presents to the International Protection Office will have immediate access to a bed, food, a shower and medical care.  They will not have to spend the night on the streets or to look for emergency housing.  While I have heard many calls to end the system I have yet to hear a credible alternative being proposed in its place.  </p>  <p>  Of course no system is without room for improvement and Minister Stanton and I are working with the Department officials to continually enhance and develop the entire system so that the best possible set of facilities and services can be provided to those in our care.  This includes the ongoing implementation of the relevant recommendations in the Justice McMahon Report and the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to reforming the system, with particular focus on families and children.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-26a.448.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600067#WRK01100"><p>I am, of course, conscious of the impact which anti-social behaviour, including anti-social driving have on the quality of life for residents in local communities.  </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities as part of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will appreciate that the specific allocation of personnel and other resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, but I am assured that the Garda National Model of Community Policing continues to play a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  This commitment is also very evident in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme, under which new Community Policing Teams are to be introduced in each Garda District. </p><p>Local policing measures to address the type of issues referred to by the Deputy will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 so that the Commissioner has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.</p><p>I hope you will appreciate that the policing response to such crimes, including the deployment of Garda resources at local level, is a matter for the Garda authorities in the first instance.  I am advised that Garda management carefully monitors the incidence of such crime and that Garda resources are deployed in response to changing crime trends. This may include directing resources at areas designated as &ldquo;hot-spots&rdquo; for anti-social behaviour.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety.  The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have a role in relation to Garda policing strategies in any particular local area but have brought Deputy's specific concerns to the attention of the Garda authorities. </p><p>I am advised that Garda authorities conduct ongoing strategic local enforcement operations targeting anti-social driving.  These enforcement operations are intelligence-led, targeting areas in particular where young drivers congregate. Regular Garda mobile patrols and checkpoints are also conducted in these areas and social media and websites are monitored to assist in establishing where events are taking place and to implement the necessary operational Garda response.  Such operations have resulted in young drivers being prosecuted or for driving without a learner permit, driving unaccompanied while on a learner permit and driving a vehicle with prohibited modifications.  Where breaches of road traffic legislation are detected, the Garda authorities make full use of the fixed charge notice, penalty point system, court prosecutions and Juvenile Diversion Programme where appropriate.  <b></b></p><p>Anyone affected by the matters referred to should, of course, contact their local Garda station. Alternatively, information can be provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by way of the Garda confidential line, 1800 666 111, which is a monitored freephone line that allows members of the public to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with information of a confidential nature. Alternatively, members of the public can call Crimestoppers on 1800 25 00 25 to report such matters.</p><p>As you are aware, all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are tasked with the enforcement of relevant legislation, including the Road Traffic Acts and persons found engaging in dangerous driving are dealt with in accordance with the law.  Specific operations are also conducted targeting anti-social driving behaviour based on analysis of the incidence and location of such behaviour.  Garda management closely monitor all patrols and other road traffic strategies in place, with a view to meeting the policing needs of communities, including to address speeding and anti-social driving, and with a view to reducing the number of fatal and serious injuries on our roads.  <b></b></p><p>I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.<b></b></p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Limerick Division, on 31 July 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 552.  There are also<b></b>32 Garda Reserves and 49 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 39 of whom have been assigned to the Limerick Division including 5 from the most recent attestation on 22 September.  I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Limerick Division in the coming years. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p></reply>

This process is instructed and informed by many sources: principally from the IPS itself and the Minister for Justice and Equality but also, for example, from recommendations contained in reports of the Inspector of Prisons, the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), various UN Committees and, of course, reports of the Visiting Committees attached to individual prisons.  Many of these recommendations overlap or have a common theme.</p><p>Over the past number of years the IPS has made many changes in programmes, policies, regimes and infrastructure to improve the lives of prisoners and thereby to create a safer community.  Many of these improvements were suggested by the entities referenced above, including Visiting Committees.</p><p>These improvements include, inter alia: </p><p>- A reduction in the numbers of prisoners in custody to the point where overcrowding is all but eliminated in the prison system;</p><p>- A capital programme to enhance the quality of accommodation and which has almost eliminated the practise of 'slopping out';</p><p>- An Incentivised Regimes Policy which encourages prisoners to engage with the services available and provides tangible evidence of the benefit of such engagement;</p><p>- The ending of detention of juveniles in the adult prison system.</p><p>- The introduction of Integrated Sentence Management;</p><p>- The expansion of drug treatment programmes;</p><p>- The significant reduction of the number of prisoners on solitary confinement;</p><p>- The introduction of fines legislation which will, over time, eliminate the need for persons convicted of a fines offence to be sent to prison in all but the most serious of cases;</p><p>- The introduction of a Community Return Programme and a Community Support Scheme which greatly improved the sentence management of suitable prisoners; </p><p>- The current engagement with the Office of the Ombudsman to establish a comprehensive Prisoner Complaints system; </p><p>- The introduction of a Families Imprisonment Group which encourages and supports greater family contact to assist those serving a sentence.</p><p>In recent years the Prison Service has published two Strategic Plans.  The first plan, from 2012 - 2015, focused on 6 key strategic actions, namely Prisoner Numbers, Prison Progression, Prisoner Programmes, Management and Staffing, the Prison Estate and Legislation consolidation.  The current Prison Service strategic plan 2016-2018 focuses on 4 key strategies, namely Staff Support, Prisoner Support, Victim Support and Enhancing Organisational Capacity.  The progress made over the lifetime of these strategies is published on a yearly basis in the Irish Prison Service Annual Report. </p><p>These Strategic Plans as well as the Annual Reports are published on the Irish Prison Service's website www.irishprisons.ie. </p></reply>

As with all such competitions, high standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness must apply.  In this regard the Authority, in accordance with good governance, has a Code of Conduct for Members and Staff of the Authority in place.  The Code is available on the Authority's website(www.policingauthority.ie) and I would refer the Deputy to section 9 which addresses the management of potential conflicts of interest.  All members and staff are required to sign a declaration agreeing to be bound by the Code.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Authority has appropriate processes and procedures in place to address any potential conflict of interest in the event that a member is considering putting themselves forward for the post. </p>  <p>  I have consulted with the chair of the Authority about a process to identify and appoint a permanent Commissioner to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We agreed that it is crucial that a deliberate and considered recruitment process takes place so that the best possible candidate is appointed.  In this regard, the Government will support the Authority in its work.  The Commission on the Future of Policing has no direct role in the recruitment process but the chair has also written to me on behalf of the Commission regarding the timescale for the process and I am considering their advice in that context.</p></reply>

This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will also be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders; for example, the well established Community Alert Programme and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme to name but a few.  </p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Since the Garda Text Alert scheme was launched in September 2013, it has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 700 local groups involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme.  Every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that funding from my Department is not used to provide direct assistance to any local Community Alert (or Text Alert) Groups, but is allocated for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers.  These Development Officers, operating in Muintir Na T&iacute;re, provide support to Community and Text Alert schemes and offer advice on how to establish new schemes.  The long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to the Department to support effective community crime prevention actions. </p>  <p>  At the National Ploughing Championships this year, I was pleased to announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate at the Scheme can find more details at www.muintiir.ie.</p></reply>

The normal checks and balances will apply to ensure the initiative is not open to abuse, but my hope is that this will make it much easier for professional artists to access social welfare supports when they need them.</p>  <p>  Confirmation of self-employed artist status must be obtained from the Visual Arts Ireland or the Irish Writers Centre.  Such artists would not be subject to the activation process for 12 months. The other conditions associated with jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will continue to apply, as they do for all other claimants.</p></reply>

This study will examine the economic impact including employment and the potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector.  Following an open tender process, Olsberg SPI Ltd in association with Nordicity, was selected to conduct the study in November last year.  The commissioning of the study was also a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs 2016. </p>  <p>  The recommendations of the economic study will inform the development of the plan envisaged under the Creative Ireland Programme for an industry wide, long term plan for Ireland as a global hub for the production of film, TV Drama and animation.</p>  <p>  On 5 May last, I hosted a very successful Media Production Workshop at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham which attracted attendance by representatives of the film, broadcast, animation and gaming industries.  The outcomes of this event will also input into the consultant's study and the proposed Government plan.  The economic study is due to be completed shortly and will underpin a Government plan for the audio-visual industry to be published later this year.</p></reply>

This allocation included over &euro;900,000 in funding for 12 projects involving artist's studios and creative spaces.  In addition, as part of the Government&rsquo;s initiative on the North East Inner City, I awarded a grant of &euro;35,000 last year to Fire Station Artists' Studios, Buckingham Street, to assist in providing additional studio space in conjunction with Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  My Department has also had discussions with the Arts Council, Dublin City Council and the OPW to consider some possible short-term and longer-term approaches to the issue, both in relation to specific issues in Dublin and to wider national approaches.</p></reply>

The Irish Coursing Club also attends local coursing meetings.  In addition, where resources allow, local National Parks and Wildlife Service Conservation Rangers attend coursing meetings, on a spot-check basis, to monitor compliance with licences issued to the ICC and its affiliated clubs.</p></reply>

It has an Exchequer allocation of &euro;3.5 million.  </p>  <p>  Nationwide, more than 500 projects across 31 local authority areas received funding approval in 2017.  </p>  <p>  Work is currently under way on the  vast majority of these projects, with a number of them already completed.  My Department keeps in close contact with all local authorities throughout the year to ensure the smooth running of the scheme and that the best possible use of funding is achieved.</p>  <p>  The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is very popular and successful and I expect the full &euro;3.5 million to be expended in 2017, supporting the owners of protected structures, creating employment in traditional construction and leveraging and encouraging private investment in protecting our heritage buildings.</p></reply>

Building on the Arts in Education Charter, this will involve the development of an integrated plan &ndash; Creative Children &ndash; to enable every child in Ireland to access tuition in music, drama, art and coding by 2022.  My Department officials continue to work with relevant Departments and other stakeholders to develop this plan.  The plan will be a primary driver of actions in this area in 2018.</p><p>I am pleased to say that continuing professional development through teacher - artist partnerships is ongoing and in July 2017 there was a significant increase in the number of courses taking place across twenty-one Education Centres throughout the country.</p><p>In addition, the Arts Council commissioned report Arts and Cultural Participation among Children and Young People: Insights from the Growing Up in Ireland Study, which was published in September 2016, concluded that arts and cultural participation leads to a range of positive outcomes for children, both in terms of their cognitive development and their wellbeing.  This study found that schools are important arenas for access to arts/culture and school emphasis on culture has a positive impact on student engagement in these activities.</p><p>This year the Arts Council increased funding in this area from &euro;3.1 million in 2016 to &euro;3.7 million in 2017 on foot of the significant increase of support of &euro;5 million which I secured for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017.  I also provided an additional &euro;70,000 to the Arts Council to assist in the expansion of the Teacher Artist Partnership this year.  </p><p>In terms of next steps, my Department is working closely with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council in preparing the Creative Children plan to deliver the objectives of Pillar 1 of the Creative Ireland Programme.  This plan will be launched later in the year.</p></reply>

This allocation included over &euro;900,000 in funding for 12 projects involving artists' studios and creative spaces.  In addition, as part of the Government&rsquo;s initiative on the North East Inner City, I awarded a grant of &euro;35,000 last year to Fire Station Artists' Studios, Buckingham Street, to assist in providing additional studio space in conjunction with Dublin City Council.</p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is an all-of-Government programme which is being led by my Department in partnership with other Departments and Agencies, local authorities, the third level sector, arts and culture organisations (including the National Cultural Institutions), and relevant NGOs.

Further details of the funding framework can be accessed on the Arts Council's website at the following link <i>.</i></p><p>I will continue to support the Arts Council, as set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government, which contains a commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  To this effect in Budget 2017, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council.  The increase in the Arts Council's allocation in 2017 is &euro;5 million, or 8%.  This will assist the Council greatly in implementing its 10-year strategy Making Great Art Work (2016-2025) including under its new funding framework.</p></reply>

Tenders must be submitted to the HSE by 25 September 2017.  The HSE anticipates that the contract will be awarded by 1 November 2017.  The initial contract will be for an 18-month pilot phase with an evaluation at 6 months and again at 18 months.  </p>  <p>  The provider and the proposed location will be known once the evaluation of the tender submissions is completed by end of October 2017.  </p>  <p>  As the tender process is still underway, it is not appropriate for me to comment on individual organisations who may be included in the tender process.  </p>  <p>  It is estimated that it will cost in the region of &euro;1.5m a year to run the SIF.

I would like to emphasise both my own and my Department&rsquo;s commitment to openness and transparency in all aspects of our work, including engagement and communication with the public, service users, public representatives and stakeholders generally.  This is in line with commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government and in Working Better Together, the Department's organisational change programme.  Consultation is now a core feature of initiatives and policy developments across the health area, with a view to supporting considered, evidence based policy making.  My Department's website includes details of various public consultations, involving calls for submissions on various policy and strategic initiatives by the Department, including those still underway.  </p>  <p>  The recently published National Cancer Strategy 2017 - 2026 provides a good example of this.  A Cancer Patient Forum was established as part of the strategy development process to represent the views of patients and patient groups and to enable them to inform the development of the strategy.  In addition, a public consultation was undertaken to obtain the views of the public and of organisations on current cancer services and priorities for the future.  </p>  <p>  The 2004 Health Act also provides for mechanisms for consultation on health service planning.  Section 42 of the Act provides for the establishment of not more than four Regional Health Forums, the membership of which is composed of members nominated by city and county councils.  The Regulations providing for the establishment of the Regional Health Forums, the Health Act 2004 (Regional Health Forums) Regulations 2005, were made on 12 December 2005 and provided for the establishment of the Forums on 1 January 2006.  </p>  <p>  The function of the Regional Health Forums, as set out in the 2004 Act, is to provide local public representatives with an opportunity to make representations to the Health Service Executive on the range and operation of health and personal social services in their area and ensure that such public representatives would continue to be heard in relation to the operation and development of health and personal social services in their areas.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond direct to the Deputy in relation to the avenues they make available to the public for involvement in decisions regarding health service planning.  </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  </p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State. In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p>  <p>  - Price(s) previously charged;</p>  <p>  - Local market price; and</p>  <p>  - Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.  </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.  </p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and work in this area is ongoing and well advanced.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's reference to a national forum for elderly care as requested by the sector, while consultation is, and always will remain, an important part of our approach, it is considered that it would be inappropriate to delegate elements of public policy, possibly including budgetary policy, to any consultative forum, particularly where some of those represented may have a commercial vested interest in the outcome.  That said, there are a number of mechanisms through which consultation and ongoing engagement takes place.  The Department engages with key stakeholders regularly to discuss concerns and ideas, and hosts an annual stakeholder forum under the umbrella of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  </p></reply>

The HSE met the PSWAI representatives on the 7 July 2017 and are committed to establishing a working group to look at the challenges of those suffering from Pradar Willi Syndrome.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government states that the Government wishes to provide more accessible respite care to facilitate full support for people with a disability.  The HSE's Social Care Operational Plan for 2017 aims to provide 182,000 overnight stays in centre-based respite services, in addition to 41,000 day respite sessions.  Respite care for children and adults with disabilities is provided by the HSE directly in some instances, or by agencies funded by the HSE to provide services on its behalf.</p>  <p>  The HSE remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services, including respite services, are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  And as the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for further reply.</p></reply>

The terms of reference of this multisectoral group includes the development of clinical guidance documents and recommendations in relation to the use of HIV PrEP in Ireland.  The Working Group is exploring questions in relation to the feasibility, acceptability and uptake of HIV PrEP in Ireland and work has commenced on identifying how these priority questions can be answered through a project within existing clinical infrastructures. In addition the Working Group had explored the possibility of running a &lsquo;demonstration project&rsquo; in Ireland with the support of a manufacturer of a relevant authorised product, however,  I understand that the demonstration project is not being pursued at this juncture as the window of opportunity has now closed.  The Working Group has also progressed work on the development of standards for PrEP service provision and other issues relevant to any future &lsquo;model of care&rsquo; and implementation of a PrEP clinical service within a HIV prevention programme to people who would meet determined eligibility criteria and in services meeting agreed standards.</p>  <p>  A pharmaceutical manufacturer has submitted a rapid review dossier to the HSE and a rapid review has been formally commissioned from the NCPE (National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics).  This is in line with the standard process under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The outcome of the four week rapid review process has recommended that a full pharmacoeconomic evaluation be undertaken.  Following receipt of a further submission from Gilead (which may take between 3 and 6 months) the NCPE starts the 90 day clock on/clock off timeframe for completing the evaluation.  This could take between 3 and 6 months to complete at which time the NCPE will make a recommendation to the HSE Leadership team.</p></reply>

Those hospitals/maternity units currently providing anomaly scans accept referrals from other maternity units, if requested.  This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit consider that an anomaly scan is clinically indicated.</p>  <p>  The National Maternity Strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis and this work will be led by the HSE National Women and Infants Health Programme. Indeed, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the Programme and, accordingly, it will develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans at 20 weeks.  In the meantime, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.</p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers.  In this context it is expected that the establishment of maternity networks across Hospital Groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each Hospital Group can access anomaly scans.  In relation to the specific queries raised, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

The Programme, with its wide remit and dedicated expertise, will facilitate greater oversight and support for service providers and will ensure the appropriate allocation and targeting of new resources.</p>  <p>  The National Maternity Strategy is also very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis and this work will be led by the NWIHP.  Indeed, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the Programme.  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers.  In this context it is expected that the establishment of maternity networks across hospital groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each hospital group can access anomaly scans.</p>  <p>  In relation to this particular query, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>- Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>- Price(s) previously charged;</p><p>- Local market price; and</p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and work in this area is ongoing and well advanced.</p></reply>

A crisis pregnancy is perhaps one of the most stressful events in a woman&rsquo;s life and therefore places her in a very vulnerable position.  Positive Options, a crisis pregnancy service which is funded and overseen by the Health Service Executive, provides counselling in 50 locations nationwide and provides women with free, non-judgemental counselling. </p><p>  I am aware, however, that some other bodies providing counselling may not adhere to the same standards.  The Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act, 1995  defines the conditions under which information relating to abortion services lawfully available in another state might be made available in Ireland.  That Act provides that where information is provided that would assist a woman in obtaining a termination abroad, that information must be truthful and objective and that a breach of this provision is an offence.  If an individual considers that information provided under the Act is not truthful and objective the matter may be referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, work is ongoing on regulating counsellors generally under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  Pregnancy counselling (other than that provided by doctors, nurses or social workers) will be taken into account in this context.

A variety of methods are in place to facilitate reporting, such as online reporting tools, submitting a form by post or email, or reporting by telephone.  The HPRA website includes a dedicated section on reporting of suspected adverse reactions which provides information for healthcare professionals as well as members of the public on the importance of reporting and the methods for doing so. </p>  <p>  The HPRA regularly highlights reporting recommendations in its Drug Safety Newsletter, which is distributed to registered healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists and dentists.  The HPRA has also highlighted the reporting of suspected adverse reactions in its regular articles in MIMS Ireland (an independently edited publication designed as a prescribing guide primarily for general practitioners) and in the Irish Medicines Formulary (a non-promotional medicines reference source for Ireland). </p>  <p>  In 2017, the HPRA collaborated on the development of an e-learning module for healthcare professionals to learn about the importance of reporting suspected adverse drug reactions.  The availability of this e-learning module was communicated to healthcare professionals via the HPRA website and the HPRA Drug Safety Newsletter.  In addition, a number of leaflets have been issued by the HPRA to highlight patient awareness around taking medicines safely and advising patients of reporting options.  These leaflets have been distributed to the public through a number of channels, including being made available in GP surgeries.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p><p>Funding of &euro;1.69 billion was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) for disability services in 2017.  This represented an increased allocation of &euro;130 million compared to the previous year.  Funding in 2017 has supported the provision of a wide range of services to people with disabilities as follows: <table><tr><th>Disability Services Programme: &euro;1.69 billion 2017</th><th>Quantum of Services</th></tr><tr><td>Residential services</td><td>9,000 people</td></tr><tr><td>Day services</td><td>Over 22,000 people</td></tr><tr><td>Respite residential support</td><td>182,500 overnights</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Assistant services</td><td>1.4 million hours </td></tr><tr><td>Home Support services</td><td>2.75 million hours</td></tr><tr><td>Move from institutions to homes in the community</td><td>223 people</td></tr></table></p><p>In addition, 2017 has seen targeted improvements in a number of priority areas.  These include the reconfiguration of disability residential services, supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding and by the Service Reform Fund and improved compliance with National Standards for Residential Centres for Children and Adults with Disabilities.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  Before the State can ratify the Convention however, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right.  Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  This work is being led by the Department of Justice and Equality with the assistance of the Department of Health. </p></reply>

The number of accountable persons for emergency medicines is 21 overall.  Each organisation may have more than one site and more than one accountable person registered.  </p>  <p>  Prescription only medications (POMs) are so designated because there are safety concerns about these medications.  The administration of a POM should not be done lightly and should only occur following appropriate training.  A decision to undergo training on the use and administration of an emergency medicine rests with individual organisations.</p>  <p>  The cost of the Cardiac First Response (CFR) and Medications for Listed Organisations (MLO) training courses and the supplementary modules in administering emergency medicines are determined by the Recognised Institutions (RIs) approved to deliver the training programme.  PHECC RIs include voluntary organisations, higher education institutions, commercial companies and statutory public bodies.  Education course material, including assessment tools, has been developed by PHECC for use by the RIs in their delivery of the CFR and MLO courses.  </p>  <p>  The CFR and MLO courses involve 2 modules - medication management and medicinal product administration modules of 2-4 hours duration and incorporate the basic modules of Cardiac First Response.  Thus the total duration of the course may be between six to eight hours. This time period facilitates the teaching, learning and skill assessment required for non-medical persons to safely care for persons in the community who may be experiencing life threatening conditions such as anaphylaxis, hypoglycaemia, severe angina, acute asthmatic attack and pain relief in emergency rescue situations.  Acute illness can progress very quickly to cardiac arrest therefore all authorised persons must be able to identify and treat a cardiac arrest which is the minimum clinical training required prior to completion of the medication modules.</p>  <p>  PHECC have advised that they do not believe, at this point in time, that their Education and Training Standards need to be updated in order to enable communities to have better access to these life saving medicines. Rather that continued improvement of the general public&rsquo;s awareness of this health policy initiative is critical to its successful implementation.</p></reply>

Hospital management temporarily suspended operations for a week to facilitate the Galway University Hospital Buildings and Maintenance Unit to effect repairs. </p>  <p>  However, a second leak was noted on 13 September and Saolta advise that a multi-disciplinary team, consisting of members of the hospital's management and infection control teams and the HSE's West Estates division, took the immediate decision, in the interest of patient safety, to suspend operations in the two theatres to allow a full assessment of the infrastrucutural damage and the development of a plan to effect a complete repair of the damage.  As a result, elective orthopaedic surgeries are now being deferred at Merlin Park and affected patients are being contacted by the Hospital.  It should be noted however that no emergency patients have been affected.</p>  <p>  Saolta and the University Hospital Galway management team have engaged an external engineering firm to carry out a full assessment of the damage and provide a time-frame for the completion of repairs.  In addition, they are exploring a range of potential solutions including the use of modular theatres as an interim measure; assessing the scope to utilise excess theatre capacity in University Hospital Galway; and evaluating the appropriateness of outsourcing some services to the private hospital sector. </p>  <p>  The relative merits of these solutions or a combination thereof will largely be determined by the length of time the orthopaedic theatres are expected to be out of commission.  This timeline is also necessary to estimate the number of  patients whose cases may be deferred. </p>  <p>  Saolta and the University Hospital Galway management team have both been in regular contact with my Department to update on the situation at Merlin Park and my Department has requested that the Saolta Group formulate and implement a contingency plan to address this incident. </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to contact you directly as soon as possible with this information.</p></reply>

The HSE is currently focused on offering graduating nurses and midwives permanent posts and replacing agency staff with permanent staff. Recruitment of additional nurses is also the subject of considerable ongoing activity by the HSE and voluntary hospitals with campaigns in train in Ireland and abroad.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives. </p>  <p>  In 2015 a recruitment support package was introduced with the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This recruitment package provides for up to &euro;1,500 in vouched removal/relocation expenses including the cost of flights subject to Revenue guidelines on allowable removal expenses to nurses who return from overseas.  Extension of the scheme was agreed as part of the Nursing Agreement 2017. Circular 26/2017 states:</p>  <p>  "As part of the March 2017 agreement between Nursing /Midwifery Unions and the HSE, it has now been agreed to extend this scheme, known as the &ldquo;Bring them Home&rdquo; campaign beyond the U.K, to encompass nurses returning and taking up employment in the Irish Public Health Service from any overseas location.  Such payments should be processed and drawn down at local employer level as expenses and each Hospital group/CHO should have a robust application process, which includes a commitment by the nurse to remain in the employment for a period of 12 months.  This initial payment should be made immediately following these matters being finalised.  Additionally, there is, as part of the nursing/midwifery agreement, provision for the payment of an additional &euro;1,500, after a period of 12 months employment with the employer, and subject to a commitment to remain in that employment for a further period of 12 months."</p></reply>

When a patient is removed from a waiting list due to non-response to a written validation cycle, notification must be sent to the referring clinician and the patient.  A copy should also be placed in the patient&rsquo;s Health Care Record (HCR).  If requested by the GP/referring clinician, patients can be reinstated back to their original place on to the Waiting List. </p><p>In addition, clinical validation is the process whereby the Clinician or delegate clinical team member conducts a review of the patients healthcare records and/or medical notes for patients on inpatient, day case and planned procedure waiting lists in excess of six months.  Where there is a requirement for clinical validation, patients are contacted by phone by the clinician or delegate as part of a virtual clinic.

The health of the national sheep flock relies on the observance of identification and trade rules.  Sheep smuggling results in the breach of these rules and could pose disease risks for the national sheep flock.  Reports of illegal movement of sheep are examined by staff in my Department.  Where evidence of a breach of identification or trade requirements is established, such cases may be prosecuted, provided the evidence is considered sufficient to sustain a conviction.  My Department works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with the corresponding authorities in Northern Ireland in an effort to combat farm-animal related crime.  I want to assure the Deputy that should evidence of illegal movement of sheep into the country be substantiated, every effort will be made to have the matter prosecuted.</p></reply>

My Department endeavours to have reactors removed from a holding as quickly as possible.  However, there are many factors beyond the control of my Department which may delay the removal of reactors.  These include delays on the part of the herdowner in accepting a valuation, the need to comply with EU regulations prohibiting the transport of animals in late stages of pregnancy or having recently calved, the medication of animals shortly before the skin test etc.  My Department does not believe that such delays constitute a risk to other animals in the herds because farmers are required by law to segregate reactors from the rest of the herd and to take other biosecurity precautions thereby mitigating the risk of the spread of disease.</p></reply>

Section 39 of the Forestry Act 1988 provided inter alia that all of the State&rsquo;s forest estate, other than land designated by the Minister, stand vested in the company.  Notwithstanding the vesting of the bulk of the State&rsquo;s forest estate in Coillte upon its establishment, a lot of the land may still be registered in the name of one of my predecessors e.g. Minister for Lands.  Coillte advise that the company is entitled to act as the registered owner as successor in title to the Minister under the Forestry Act.</p>  <p>  In relation to the other material requested, Coillte advise that listed habitats and species relating to these properties, and others within that Business Area Unit (BAU 5), are listed in the relevant BAU Strategic Plan, available on Coillte&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Coillte advised that the company received a derogation for the use of cypermethrin for control of large pine weevil (Hylobius abietis) in certified forest plantations in Ireland, provided that during the derogation period the certificate holder adheres to conditions as set out by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).  I am advised that it is Coillte&rsquo;s policy that cypermethrin will not be applied in the company&rsquo;s forests from the period at the end of the derogation, March 2021.</p>  <p>  The company add that, as the major landowner in the country, it recognises the importance of the responsible use of pesticides in its woodlands and confirms that it will use only those pesticides authorised for use in Ireland by the Pesticides Registration and Control Division (PRCD) of my Department.</p>  <p>  Coillte advise that it operates an integrated pest management system with primary reliance upon prevention and biological control methods rather than chemical pesticides, and that it strives to avoid the use of chemical pesticides, by firstly considering control methods other than chemicals.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Coillte that the company&rsquo;s overall strategy for the five year period of the derogation is to develop and adopt prescriptions for control of large pine weevil on evidence based population assessments.  I am also advised that this involves different prescriptions for low, medium and high density population sites where with timing of planting and the pre-treatment of plants in nurseries the use of pesticides on low and medium density populations may not, dependent on ongoing monitoring, be required.  On high density population sites Coillte envisage that some form of pesticide application for control of weevil will be required.  I understand that field trials and research are continuing on alternative pesticides (authorised by PRCD) to cypermethrin where focus in this area of research is on pre-treatment that could give two year protection to plants thus eliminating requirement for application in the forest.</p>  <p>  Coillte advise me that Ireland, in common with the UK, has weevil population densities of up to seven times that recorded in Europe and that the company work in collaboration with their colleagues in Forest Enterprise Scotland, Forest Enterprise England, Natural Resources Wales and Northern Ireland Forest Service with expertise provided from Forestry Commission Forest Research Branch.  I understand that, over the past number of years, the group established trials to identify alternative treatments for Hylobius, researching and trialling alternative chemicals to cypermethrin, barriers (wax and paper sleeves), biological control through nematodes and non-chemical substance barriers and development of a Hylobius Management Support System.</p>  <p>  Coillte further add that it also collaborates with Irish research organisations in order to develop non-chemical pest control products, such as research with the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM) on biological control methods like entomopathogenic nematode and entomopathogenic fungi and will continue to review and evaluate non-chemical alternatives as they become available.</p></reply>

A forest may look abandoned for example due to an absence of thinning or road construction activity but this may be due to a no thinning policy on that particular site for silvicultural reasons.</p>  <p>  Two significant events occurred in recent years which have impacted on forests failing to reach their productive potential; these were ash dieback disease which was first identified in late 2012 and the damage caused by the severe winter storms of 2013/2014.  In relation to ash dieback disease a reconstitution scheme was put in place by the Department to fund the removal of infected material and to replant these areas with an alternative species.  The total area of sites cleared and funded under this scheme is 1.4 hectares in Donegal, 5.2 hectares in Sligo, 29.9 hectares in Clare, 49.8 hectares in Galway and 10.4 hectares in Mayo.</p>  <p>  The 2012 National Forest Inventory calculated that there was a total of 380 million tonnes of carbon in the forest estate.  Based on the most recent National Inventory Report reported to the UNFCCC, in 2015 forests and harvested wood products, net of deforestation emissions, resulted in total removals of 4.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in that year.  Projections up to 2030 of changes in forest carbon stocks were provided as part of Ireland&rsquo;s report on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Actions as required under EU Decision 529/2013.  These indicate that the total removals of carbon dioxide by forests and wood products, net of projected deforestation emissions, will amount to 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.  The projections are currently being updated in light of the most recent Roundwood Production Forecast, more up to date afforestation and deforestation data, and related information.</p></reply>

To address these pressing issues in the most effective manner I introduced a targeted measure of assistance.</p><p>Support under this measure will apply to losses of livestock, conserved fodder (hay or silage) and as a contribution towards the clean-up cost of agricultural lands, including repair to fences, damaged by debris washed up by the floods.  The measure will be subject to the provisions of EU de minimis state aid rules in the agriculture sector and only losses not covered by insurance will be eligible for consideration. </p><p>While it is not possible to address all of the problems the unprecedented rainfall caused on farms in Inishowen, this measure will address the principal impacts on those farmers most affected.  This measure was introduced specifically to address damage experienced by farmers from the unprecedented rainfall of 22 August last.  Accordingly, claims for damage resulting from any earlier weather event are not eligible for consideration.</p><p>Application forms are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website or from<b></b>the Direct Payments Unit (Flood Damage Relief Measure), Government Offices, Old Abbeyleix Road, Portlaoise, Co Laois.  There is also a dedicated helpline and email address, (057) 8674456 and <i>floodreliefscheme@agriculture.gov.ie</i>to support those farmers who wish to make an application.

This is an increase on the first pay runs issued in 2016 when 65,000 farmers were paid &euro;140 million.</p>  <p>  I am also delighted to confirm that the European Commission has agreed to my request that provision be made for an advance payment of 70% under the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme and Greening.  This is an increase on the standard 50% rate allowed for under the EU regulations.  There will also be an increase permitted to the advance payment rate under a number of Pillar II Rural Development schemes with the rate increased up to a possible 85% for those schemes where advance payments will be made before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work towards processing payments under these schemes as a matter of priority, to ensure that these vital supports are delivered to farmers in the most timely and efficient manner possible.</p></reply>

The payment rates are based on the agreed costings underlying the actions to be undertaken in the scheme, and an increase in payments would thus require changes to the actions currently being undertaken by farmers.  Any such changes to the details of the scheme would require the agreement of the European Commission via the formal Rural Development Programme amendment process.  It is not currently anticipated that there will be an increase in the level of payment to participants of the scheme. </p></reply>

My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.  This analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subjected to a refinement process.  The timing for the introduction of this new designation is dependent on the outcome of current discussions at EU level in relation to the 'Omnibus Proposal.'</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase the budget for the Scheme by &euro;25m in Budget 2018.  This commitment will be considered via the annual budgetary process.  I am committed to ensuring that all available funds under the scheme are targeted in the most effective manner.</p></reply>

Following this intense lobbying, the Commission decided to exclude a TRQ for beef when it exchanged offers with Mercosur on 11 May 2016. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2016, the Commission published its study on the cumulative economic impact of future trade agreements on EU agriculture.  The study demonstrated the vulnerability of specific agricultural sectors in the face of growing imports following increased market access, especially beef, rice and, to a lesser extent, poultry and sugar.  It confirmed the EU position regarding the sensitive character of these products in trade negotiations, and the particular sensitivity of the beef sector. </p>  <p>  There are now firm indications that the Commission intends to exchange offers with Mercosur again very soon, and to include a TRQ for beef.  This presents a very significant threat to the Irish and EU beef sectors, and does not take into account either the additional information available since last year in the form of the cumulative impact assessment or the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market. </p>  <p>  Ireland made a strong intervention to this effect at the Trade Policy Committee meeting in Brussels on 15 September, and was supported by a number of other member states.  We are continuing to work with those member states and Commissioner Hogan to ensure that the interests of Irish and European Beef farmers are safeguarded. </p></reply>

Scientifically, very little is known about the sprat species.

In order to address the lack of accurate information in respect of the sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry, commenced in October 2014 and is now in its final stage, under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.</p>  <p>  In addition to this research project, the Marine Institute advise that they will also participate in an observer scheme where they will work closely with Industry to obtain increased observer coverage on any sprat fishery that is taking place.  The purpose of the observer scheme is twofold:</p>  <p>  - To obtain biological information on the resource itself and on any other fishery bycatch, ie herring, juvenile mackerel, etc.</p>  <p>  - To obtain information on any bycatch this fishery might have of protected, endangered and threatened species, under the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) marine biodiversity scheme such as marine mammals, seabirds and listed fish species.  </p>  <p>  This enhanced observer scheme will be co-funded under the EMFF data collection scheme and the EMFF marine biodiversity scheme allowing for more intensive data collection to enhance scientific knowledge and support any future management actions necessary for the stock including the issue of pair trawling.</p></reply>

However, the environment in which the post office operates is changing and the network needs to change to thrive particularly with the move to digital transactions.  This involves harnessing existing strengths such as its trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with individual communities to build the network of the future.  The post office plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike and this is at the forefront of An Post&rsquo;s mandate.  The Government is fully committed to a sustainable post office network which it sees as a key piece of economic and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas. </p>  <p>  The strategic review of An Post, including the post office network, which will identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing is nearing completion.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.</p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this projected shortfall, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July of this year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The Plan sets out what Ireland is currently doing, and is planning to do, to further the national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015.  Although this first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emission reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p></reply>

Enforcement of waste collection permit conditions is a matter for the relevant local authority.  </p><p>The Government's policy of increasing the landfill levy to its current level of &euro;75 per tonne has provided a real financial incentive for operators to divert as much material as possible from being disposed of at landfill.  The application of this economic instrument has ensured that it is in the financial interest of collectors, who are competing for market share, to encourage effective recycling in an effort to minimise costs for operators and customers alike. </p><p>The success of the above policy and legislative measures to encourage waste prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery has meant that  more waste can be put to environmentally sustainable and productive use as opposed to being buried in the ground.  The statistics show that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time in terms of improving our recycling rates.  In this regard, <i>National Waste Statistics - Reports and Bulletins </i>are available to download at<i></i><i><i></i></i>including the recently published table on <i>Progress towards EU waste recycling, recovery and diversion targets.</i></p></reply>

Details of the progress of the Taskforce are made available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>In addition, actions in support of the transition to LEVs were included in the <i>National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport: 2017-2030</i>, which I published in May.  The <i>Framework </i>aims to remove barriers to the uptake of LEVs by addressing such infrastructure requirements as EV charging points.  The <i>Framework </i>sets an ambitious target that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero emissions (or zero emissions capable), reducing our dependence on the use of conventional fossil fuels for transport.</p></reply>

This new measure is underpinned by an International Agreement between Ireland and the UK.</p>  <p>  Under the Ireland/UK Agreement, the driving disqualification is, in effect, transferred by the State which imposes it to the licence of the offender's "home" state, so the legal consequence of the offence committed follows the offender home.</p>  <p>  In Ireland mutual recognition of driver disqualifications of a person normally resident in Ireland or holding an Irish driving licence who has been disqualified from driving in the UK for one of the very serious offences covered by the Agreement will be pursued by the Road Safety Authority who will apply to the relevant court in Ireland for a court order which will impose the disqualification in Ireland.  Similarly the Road Safety Authority will notify the relevant UK authorities of persons normally resident in the UK or holding a UK driving licence who have been disqualified from driving in Ireland, and the relevant UK authorities will similarly pursue the disqualification in the UK.</p>  <p>  Mutual recognition of driving disqualifications is an important road safety measure for both Ireland and the UK, and I know you will share my hope that it will be successful in helping to improve driver behaviour and in reducing deaths and injuries on our roads.</p></reply>

Ireland will formulate its position upon consideration of these detailed proposals for noise and any other environmental protection standards once they have been received.  The Department is committed to consulting publicly on any such proposals.</p>  <p>  I am happy to say that Ireland is fully committed to the development of a sustainable, resource-efficient aviation sector and is engaged in ongoing efforts at both national and international level to address the environmental impact of aviation.  For example, Ireland continues to participate in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), which requires that all airlines operating in Europe must monitor, report and verify their emissions, and surrender allowances against those emissions.  In addition, Ireland has volunteered to participate in the pilot phase of ICAO&rsquo;s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which aims to maintain the global net CO2  emissions from international aviation at 2020 levels.  Finally, officials within my Department have also developed an effective working relationship with their colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Through open and constructive discussions both Departments are working together to formulate an overall Irish approach to environmental sustainability in aviation.</p></reply>

All complaints received by Tusla, from this date, are managed under the &quot;Tell Us&quot; policy.  Any individual who wishes to make a complaint about Tusla services can do so through the &quot;Tell Us&quot; complaints process. Contact details and further information are on Tusla's website <i>www.tusla.ie</i>.  &quot;Tell Us&quot; explains how complaints can be managed or feedback can be provided with a focus on local and speedy resolution. Where informal local resolution is not possible, a Complaints Officer will be appointed to examine the matter.  This process takes up to 30 days. If it takes longer, the process provides for regular updates every 20 days.  If, after that, a person remains dissatisfied with the recommendations of the investigation, they can either seek a review of their complaint by a Tusla review officer or contact the Ombudsman or Ombudsman for Children's Office. All complainants are advised of this</p><p>Concerns communicated to Tusla by a member of the Oireachtas, through a representation that constitutes a complaint, are referred to the appropriate service within Tusla.  A response issues from Tusla confirming that this has been done. An acknowledgement of receipt of the complaint is also issued to the complainant, where identified, within 10 working days.  Tusla has established a specific email address (tuslapad@tusla.ie) in order that Oireachtas members may convey any concerns directly to Tusla. Public representatives may also make a complaint on behalf of a constituent directly to tellus@tusla.ie.</p><p>In order to ensure independence with regard to complaints investigations, &quot;Tell Us  &quot; provides that a complaints officer should not be involved in managing a complaint about a matter in which they have had either a direct or indirect involvement.  In such circumstance the complaint must be passed to another complaints officer not linked to the complaint.</p><p>The Irish Foster Care Association, through its contact with the Department, has voiced concern with regard to the Tusla management of allegations made in relation to foster carers, while also emphasising the good work that is being carried out.  In response to feedback from the Association, and from social work teams and foster carers, Tusla has committed to the development of a National Guidance for Responding to Child Protection and Welfare Concerns in Foster Care.  This guidance will be finalised later this year. The voices of foster care families and children in care are valued, and it is important that any concerns raised are responded to promptly and comprehensively.  </p><p>It should also be emphasised that Tusla follows the Children First National Guidance on the Protection and Welfare of Children, 2011, in responding to all allegations of child protection and welfare concerns.  In addition, since its approval in September 2014, a national policy, &lsquo;Policy &amp;amp; Procedures for Responding to Allegations of Child Abuse &amp;amp; Neglect&rsquo;, was implemented to ensure a standardised approach in responding to, and assessing, all child protection and welfare concerns relating to children, regardless of their care status.</p><p>Tusla has also issued a guidance document to its staff on the Management of Serious Concerns and Allegations, detailing guiding principles, including statutory requirements and a Tusla protocol for the management of serious concerns and allegations against foster carers.  This relates to serious concerns or allegations that are raised by children in foster care, birth parents, foster carers, or third parties.  Any serious allegation reported to Tusla is taken seriously, and managed appropriately and sensitively.</p><p>It is evident from the foregoing that Tusla has developed, and strengthened, its complaints policy framework.  This should provide the necessary basis for a more prompt and efficient service for Oireachtas members and for the general public.  This is an important matter, acknowledged as such by Tusla, which will be kept under close review by my Department in discharging its oversight function in respect of Tusla.</p></reply>

The CCS Plus programme also includes a universal subsidy (CCSU) available to all families with children not yet eligible for the ECCE scheme and not eligible for the subventions targeted at lower income families.

The land-holders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans. </p>  <p>   A total of 39 trails are currently covered by the scheme and the number of participants on the scheme stands at 1,904.  Payments made by my Department in 2017 in respect of the scheme will be in the region of &euro;1.8 million and will be disbursed through the Local Development Company network.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to double the number of walks covered by the Walks Scheme.  My officials are working towards this objective. However, as significant consultation will be required, both with land-holders and other stakeholders, it is unlikely that any increase in the number of walks covered by the scheme will be implemented until 2018.  The provision of additional funding to support the scheme will be a matter for consideration as part of the annual Estimates process.</p></reply>

In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:</p>  <p>  - Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially.</p>  <p>  - Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become fully known.</p>  <p>  - Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required.  It could take some time before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental/Agency response.  Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided financial support under the scheme to some 140 affected households with further payments under stages 2 and 3 being processed.  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  </p>  <p>  Assistance is not provided for losses which are covered by insurance or for commercial and business losses, or generally any loss or damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation.

To this end, I can confirm the Government&rsquo;s intention to publish, and commence the implementation of, a pensions reform plan before the end of this year.  </p>  <p>  The plan will include measures relating to the introduction of a &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; to the State pension for new pensioners, reform and simplification of the current supplementary pension landscape and measures required to transpose the EU &lsquo;IORP&rsquo; Pensions Directive.  However, perhaps the most fundamental reform contained within the plan will be a confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop a new automatic enrolment supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage.  </p>  <p>  The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is 47% of the working population and this reduces to 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Whilst the State pension provides a reasonable basic level of income and guards against poverty in retirement, if measures are not taken to address this low rate of supplementary coverage, many future retirees will experience unwanted reductions in living standards when they reach retirement.  </p>  <p>  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security and independence of future retirees. </p>  <p>  A review of international auto enrolment retirement systems has confirmed that success is dependent on well tested design and securing member trust.  To this end, further detailed evidence building and consultation will be undertaken to inform fundamental choices which are required regarding the preferred operational structure and organisational governance for a new system as well as many design elements such as contribution levels, financial incentives and target membership.  Correctly positioning/designing each of these will be critical to the success of any system.  </p>  <p>  To this end, it is my intention to undertake an automatic enrolment open consultation process over the coming months.  This process will seek to develop consensus around the principles of our approach to system infrastructure, design and implementation.  It will build on our previous engagement with sectoral interests including employer and trade union representatives as well as the pensions industry and consumer and advocate groups.</p>  <p>  The objective of planned reforms will be to establish a sound and fit for purpose pension system for the coming decades, one that will shape the retirement landscape to the benefit of our retirees for generations to come.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-26a.1301.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092600083#WRAA04500"><p>Internationally, as well as in Ireland, Defined Benefit (DB) schemes have been facing increased difficulties over the last two decades.  This has been due to volatility in the stock markets, increasing liabilities arising from the demographic pressures of increasing life expectancy, low interest rates and regulatory requirements.  Essentially the cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the level of the employer and employee contributions to pension schemes and the investment returns earned.</p>  <p>  The ongoing decline of defined benefit schemes over the past two decades has seen the number of schemes subject to the funding standard decline from 2,031 in 2000 to approximately 650 such schemes as per figures provided by the Pensions Authority on 1 June 2017.  Despite its decline, the DB sector is still a very important sector with assets under management of approximately &euro;62 billion and membership comprised of 100,000 pensioners, 125,000 active members and 435,000 deferred members.</p>  <p>  Generally speaking, where schemes have encountered funding difficulties, the process has been managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps to be taken.  Under Irish law, responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that DB schemes are properly funded and managed.  </p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority requires that, in setting investment policy, the trustees of a DB scheme must have regard to the need to satisfy at regular intervals the minimum funding standard set down in the Pensions Act.  </p>  <p>  A number of steps have been taken in recent years to reduce the risks to pension scheme members caused by market volatility.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 require a DB scheme to hold additional funding in the form of a &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; by 2023.  The function of this &lsquo;risk reserve&rsquo; is to provide some protection and long term stability for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  Additionally, and in appropriate circumstances, the regulator may approve scheme funding proposals that provide for the recovery of their schemes funding over longer periods than was previously the case. </p>  <p>  In addition, in order to provide increased investment options for pension schemes the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010 and 2011 introduced the option for trustees to purchase sovereign annuities.  Pension schemes that purchase sovereign annuities, or the underlying bonds, benefit from a reduction in their liabilities under the funding standard.  Buying sovereign annuities for the pensioners has the effect of reducing pensioner liabilities under the funding standard and provides additional funds for the other members of the scheme. </p>  <p>  While noting the steps taken thus far, a key priority for the Government is to provide additional protections for scheme members&rsquo; pension benefits.  It is essential that any new measures recognise the current pensions landscape in Ireland so that a balanced and proportionate approach is developed.</p>  <p>  I intend to introduce a number of amendments to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 at Committee Stage which will, amongst other things, ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting and will seek to address situations where funding proposals are not agreed and put in place.  The amendments will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will encourage employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.</p>  <p>  Finally, many of the provisions contained within the IORP II Directive (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision) will also support positive reform of the Irish occupational pension sector.  The Directive provides for a range of new requirements concerning governance, management standards in schemes, safekeeping of assets, the need for clear and relevant information to members, the removal of obstacles to cross-border provision of pension services and the facilitation of cross border transfer of schemes.  There are also provisions that will enhance the powers of the pension regulators for effective supervision of IORP. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Directive will require legislative changes and my officials, together with the Pensions Authority, are working on the transposition process to ensure that any necessary amendments to existing laws, regulations or administrative provisions will be made, or where necessary any new provisions are implemented, to give full effect to the Directive.  Standards in relation to occupational pension schemes will be enhanced by the transposition of the IORP II directive. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  No further increases are planned at this time.  Any need for future increases will depend on a range of factors such as increases in life expectancy, the ratio of working age people to pensioners, employment rates among older workers, pension rates, the prevailing economic environment and the availability of measures and policies to support older workers.  Given the timescales involved and the unpredictability of social and economic change in the coming decades, I believe it would be inappropriate for such decisions to be made at this point.  </p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, and where a person is available for work, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. </p>  <p>  However, it is estimated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to rise to &euro;87 million by 2020.  These figures do not include future rate increases.</p>  <p>  Reversing this decision would, therefore, significantly increase the annual cost of State pensions, and would reduce the funds available to pay for any future increases in the rates of the payment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no statutory retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may originally have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, an Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the Group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.  The final report, the recommendations of which were accepted by Government in August 2016, is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is estimated that well over half of the gross cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It has been estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million.</p>  <p>  However this would not be the total cost of reducing the State pension age.  If the age for the State pension (contributory) was reduced to 65 from 66, rather than the reintroduction of State Pension Transition, there would be an additional cost as the State Pension (contributory) does not have the retirement criterion that the State Pension Transition did.  There would, therefore, be an additional cost to the Social Insurance Fund, paid in respect of people who would still work while aged 65, in addition to receiving the State Pension (contributory), payments which did not arise under the State pension (transition).   It is unclear what that additional cost would amount to, but it would mean that the cost would be significantly higher than the &euro;84 million estimated for re-introduction of the State pension (transition).</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and a further &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure.  In addition, &euro;200 million is being provided under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund towards the capital costs of public infrastructure which, when provided, will secure the early delivery of additional housing at a considerable scale.  </p><p>Rebuilding Ireland aims to deliver 47,000 social housing units over the period 2016 to 2021.  Almost &euro;1.7 billion was expended on the implementation of a range of housing programmes over the period 2015-2016, with &euro;0.935 billion being expended in 2016 alone - this facilitated the delivery of some 13,400 social housing units in 2015 and over 19,000 units in 2016.</p><p>In Budget 2017, an increased investment of &euro;1.3 billion was provided for housing, which is supporting the delivery of over 21,000 social housing solutions this year.  This level of national funding provision to implement Rebuilding Ireland's targets means that funding is available to be drawn down as it is required by local authorities.  Indeed the evidence this year is of a much accelerated level of funding draw down by the local authorities, reflecting an acceleration in the scale and rate of construction and in other means of housing delivery.  Capital funding to date in 2017 from my Department in respect of housing programmes amounts to &euro;432.66m, compared with the same point last year when the capital spend level was &euro;130.25m.</p><p>My Department now publishes, on a quarterly basis, a comprehensive status report of all social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas showing details such as their locations, a range of information relating to their advancement, including those delivered and those progressing through planning, design and construction.  The most recent of these reports covers the period up to the end of Quarter 1 of 2017 and lists circa 600 approved social housing construction schemes, delivering over 10,000 units.  The report can be accessed at the following link:<i></i>.  Details in respect of Quarter 2 of 2017 will be published shortly.</p><p>These projects are funded under a range of different initiatives such as local authority construction, turnkey developments, rapid delivery, regeneration programmes and construction and turnkey developments by approved housing bodies.  The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates and tenanting, is a matter for the relevant local authorities and approved housing body concerned, in the first instance.</p><p>Further project approvals are being added to the construction programme as they are developed by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  I am keen that all local authorities advance their social housing projects as speedily as possible and I have assured them that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.  Indeed, I announced recently that the available funding for social housing is to be reorientated further towards direct build projects.  In 2018 alone, this will see the target of 3,000 newly build social housing units increase by almost 30% to 3,800 and this reorientation will continue over the life of Rebuilding Ireland to end 2021.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 27,000 households being supported by HAP across the State, involving more than 20,000 separate landlords and agents.  These numbers indicate that the Rebuilding Ireland target of 15,000 households to be supported by the scheme in 2017 will be met.  On average in 2017, more than 340 new households are being supported by the scheme each week and are having their housing need met by sourcing private rental accommodation with agreement of landlords and agents.</p><p>HAP addresses many long standing issues raised by landlord groups in relation to the operation of Rent Supplement.  The HAP payment is made directly to the landlord on the tenant&rsquo;s behalf and all payments are made electronically directly to the landlord - the landlord does not have to collect the rent.  The scheme has a 99% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities, and a 99% rent payment rate with minimal difficulties arising for landlords.  Furthermore, any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for housing support through the HAP scheme.  HAP recipients can avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent; under Rent Supplement, these households would lose their housing support payment. </p><p>In order to provide access to information on the scheme to interested parties, a new HAP website, <i>www.hap.ie</i>, was  launched earlier this year and provides prospective HAP tenants and landlords with the information that they need to understand how the HAP scheme works.  Local authorities are also promoting the scheme locally, and engaging with letting agents and landlords who might be interested in entering into a HAP tenancy. HAP provides landlords with many advantages including that the landlord does not have to collect the rent; payments are made electronically directly to the landlord on the tenant's behalf; landlords who rent to tenants in receipt of HAP may avail of increased tax relief; and changes in a tenant's employment circumstances do not affect the rental payments made to the landlord.</p><p>A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient.  However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are in receipt of certain payments, including HAP.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Further information is available on the Commission's website, <i></i>. </p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

One of the key objectives of the HAP scheme is to facilitate the removal of barriers to return to work for persons who are reliant on Rent Supplement for their long-term housing needs. </p>  <p>  Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for housing support through the HAP scheme.  Once in receipt of a social housing support, like HAP, the eligibility of households is not reassessed.  HAP recipients can avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent; under Rent Supplement, these households would lose their housing related support payment.  As the tenant&rsquo;s income increases, their rent contribution to the local authority will also increase.  Tenants must notify the local authority of any changes in their income.  This occurs in the same way all social housing supports, including local authority owned properties.  There is no statutory obligation for a landlord in receipt of a HAP payment on behalf of their tenant to inform a local authority if there is a change in a tenant&rsquo;s income; the HAP payment to the landlord will not change and the tenant's rent contribution to the local authority will be amended.</p>  <p>  The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of local authorities, as an integral part of their housing management functions, subject to broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 of 6 March 2002.  It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.</p>  <p>  The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies.  In 2016, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities and circa &euro;21.7M was collected in differential rent from HAP supported households.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

The Water Services Strategic Plan - A Plan for the Future of Water Services (WSSP), which was published in October 2015, set out strategic objectives for the delivery of water services for 25 years up to 2040.  The WSSP committed to the preparation of Business Plans by Irish Water to set out targets for delivery of efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure and performance targets consistent with the delivery of the objectives of the WSSP.</p>  <p>  The Irish Water Business Plan - Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021 was published in late 2015.  It set the priorities for the utility to 2021 and underpins the transformation plan for the water sector to a single utility model.  The plan was considered by Government and was approved subject to budgetary and regulatory review.  The Water Services Bill 2017 was published last week and it contains provisions for the establishment of a Water Advisory Body (WAB).  The WAB is being established to advise on measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water.  The body will report on a quarterly basis to an Oireachtas Committee on the performance of Irish Water on the implementation of its business plan.</p>  <p>  The Confidence and Supply Arrangement in support of the minority Government has confirmed the retention of Irish Water as a single national utility in public ownership responsible for the delivery of water and waste water services.  </p>  <p>  Since 2013, working through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with the Local Authorities, Irish Water has made significant progress in establishing the utility capability, which has included investing over &euro;2 billion in the system to date.  Over the past year, significant design phase work has been undertaken on the development of a transformation plan, in line with the Business Plan objectives.  Flowing from this, I have been informed by Ervia (which has responsibility for Irish Water), that they consider that the public water system will benefit significantly by greater integration of operations into the single utility.  Consequently, the Ervia Board has agreed in principle not to renew the SLAs beyond 2025 when they are due to end, and to move to a full integrated public utility operations model.  The Water Services Acts already provide the necessary protections for terms and conditions, and pensions of local authority staff working under the SLAs in such circumstances.  It is the intention of Ervia to work with local authorities to manage this change within the life of the current Business Plan (i.e. by end of 2021). </p>  <p>  A process of engagement with local authorities on the proposed next steps on the transformation plan has now commenced.  The current SLAs remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed.</p></reply>

Under Section 3(A)(9) of the Water Services Act 2014 (inserted by Section 48 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2015) a person who is a tenant of a dwelling let to him under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2014 and who proposes to purchase the dwelling shall before completion of the sale provide the local authority concerned with a certificate of discharge from Irish Water confirming that any charge under section 21 of the No. 2 Act 2013 in respect of the dwelling owed to Irish Water has been paid.

The Bill reflects the recommendations of the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  This report, published on 12 April 2017, was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill provides for the discontinuance of domestic water charges for dwellings as set out in the Water Services Act 2014, including the repeal of section 3(A) of that Act.  Pending the passage of the Bill, the current legislative framework remains in place and tenants who propose to purchase a property under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme must provide a certificate of discharge from Irish Water confirming charges up to 30 June 2016 have been paid.</p></reply>
