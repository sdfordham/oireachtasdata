Both the fieldwork and the processing of the collected forms are undertaken by CSO employees.</p>  <p>  The census is a major undertaking for the CSO and contractors have been appointed to assist with specialised parts of the work.  An outside contractor, CACI (UK) Ltd, was awarded the contract following a public procurement process to build and support an integrated forms processing system for CSO.  The design and print of the Census forms was also required as part of this contract, and this has been sub-contracted to an Irish company.</p>  <p>  The forms processing system will be managed and operated by CSO staff, with the technical support of a small number of CACI (UK) employees, and will be used to process the completed census forms in the second half of this year.  The completed census forms, and any resultant databases of the returns created during the processing, will at all stages be completely under the control of the CSO and subject to the stringent confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act 1993.</p>  <p>  The selection of the contractor was subject to, and complied fully with, EU open procurement rules.  CACI (UK) Ltd has specialist skills in the area of high volume forms processing systems and won a similar contract in 2011.  CACI (UK) Ltd was the only bidder for the contract tendered by CSO for the 2016 census.</p>  <p>  As a public body the Central Statistics Office is fundamentally committed to ethical and proper conduct in all matters.</p></reply>

Since then over 18,500 Host Organisations have provided internship opportunities to over 46,500 unemployed jobseekers.  Independent research indicates that circa 60% of jobseekers who participated in JobBridge progressed into paid employment within a short period (5 months) of completing the internship. </p><p>One of the objectives of JobBridge was to address the situation whereby unemployed people in receipt of a jobseeker payment who took up an unpaid work experience opportunity lost entitlement to their jobseeker payment.  Under JobBridge unemployed jobseekers who take up a work experience opportunity retain their jobseeker payment and, in addition, receive a sum of &euro;52.50 per week towards the cost of taking up the opportunity</p><p>Total expenditure on JobBridge is set out in Table 1.  It should be noted that these amounts include, and consist primarily of, the underlying jobseeker payment. </p><p>As part of the EU Youth Guarantee initiative some expenditure relating to interns under 25 years of age may, in future, be reclaimed under the European Social Fund (ESF) and Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) as part of the ESF Operational Programme 2014-2020. </p><p><i>Table 1</i><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011<br /><br />'&euro;000</th><th>2012<br /><br />'&euro;000</th><th>2013<br /><br />'&euro;000</th><th>2014<br /><br />'&euro;000</th><th>2015<br /><br />'&euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>Expenditure</td><td>7,913</td><td>54,739</td><td>67,688</td><td>76,029</td><td>63,500</td></tr></table></p><p>The estimated expenditure for 2016 is &euro;51.98m.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-04a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016050400063#WRA01050"><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.</p><p>The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed. </p><p>As under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, JobsPlus and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main approach in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation. </p><p>The key objective is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement with young people by case officers to assist young people to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  As part of this process additional supports may be  provided, both through existing schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015. </p><p><i>Pathways to Work 2016 -2020</i>, published in January 2016,<i></i>commits to continuing to implement the actions set out in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan (YGIP).  In addition, it commits to four additional actions:</p><p>-  Increase the share of workplace-based interventions;</p><p>-  Restructure First Steps (a work experience programme for particularly disadvantaged young people);</p><p>-  Ensure monthly engagement with young unemployed, at a minimum, is consistently maintained; and</p><p>-  Implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme.</p><p>The operation and coverage of the Youth Guarantee will be reviewed in mid-2016, based on data on outcomes for young people who became unemployed up to the end of 2015, and in the light of developments in the economy and in the labour market in the context of the overall Pathways to Work strategy. </p><p>Implementation of the Youth Guarantee is reviewed independently by the EU.  Ireland has been reviewed twice (in December 2014 and in December 2015) on its implementation of measures to tackle youth unemployment as part of the Youth Guarantee, through the EU Semester multi-lateral surveillance process within the EMCO (Employment Committee).  For the December 2015 review, EMCO concluded:</p><p>-  EMCO welcomes the efforts to implement the YG in Ireland and the positive results being experienced in relation to youth unemployment. These positive outcomes should be continued together with efforts to reduce the timespan within which the offer to young people is made.</p><p>-  Ireland has introduced several new programmes in 2015, in addition to the pre-existing programmes, offering employment, work experience and training/developmental internship opportunities to the youth.  Programmes are relevant to address youth labour market challenges and address the issues underlying the YG.  EMCO is looking forward to overall evaluation results of the new initiatives.  Substantial progress has been made in the FET/VET sector and apprenticeships, aimed at ensuring their relevance to labour market needs.  Ireland has also taken important steps toward reforming the PES and providing a more effective PES engagement process.  As regards the 2014 data collection exercise, data cover those aged 18-24 and in receipt of unemployment benefits.</p><p>The following table details the original expected full year intake on relevant programmes for 2015 as well the actual number of starters up to the most recent date for which data are available.  </p><p>These data exclude an estimated 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  Although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, these PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for young people, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.</p><p><b>Programme take-up on Youth Guarantee-related programmes</b></p><p>End of Year 2015 (information available up to 11<sup>th</sup>February 2016)<table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Expected full-year intake</th><th>2015 information to date</th><th>Note</th></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Youthreach</td><td rowspan="6">3,300<br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td rowspan="6">1684</td><td rowspan="6">Expected full year intake combines Youthreach and Community Training Centres. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Youthreach data to end September 2015</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Community Training Centres</td><td></td><td>1528</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge  </td><td>5,000</td><td>2,296</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,379</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus ( including JobPlus Youth)</td><td>1,500</td><td>676</td><td>February -December 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>2,000</td><td>1,066</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>3,300</td><td>2,900</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>200</td><td>146</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>500</td><td>n/a </td><td>Enrolment begins in September</td></tr><tr><td>Former F&Aacute;S/SOLAS*</td><td>9,500</td><td>6,629</td><td>Based on Specific Skills Training, Traineeship, Bridging &amp;amp; Local Training Initiative starters. </td></tr><tr><td>County Enterprise Board Youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports.</td><td>700</td><td></td><td>This programme has been superseded by Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) 2014/5 competition1</td></tr><tr><td>Micro Finance Ireland (MFI) youth loans </td><td>9</td><td>3</td><td>MFI defines &lsquo;youth&rsquo; loans as loans for those aged 18-25. 14 have been advanced since MFI began operations, including 2 in 2016.</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td>8 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>450</td><td>144</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>500</td><td>715</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>28,350</td><td>19,171</td><td>Excluding where figures are not available</td></tr></table></p><p>1.

The Scheme, which is currently being piloted, provides for small scale loans by Credit Unions to borrowers who have difficulty accessing low cost credit.  The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000.   </p>  <p>  The focus of the pilot scheme is social welfare recipients who avail of Personal Micro Credit loans from their Credit Union and are facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments are then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union.</p>  <p>  The pilot scheme is live in 30 Credit Unions, 28 of which have written loans.  Almost 1,200 loans have been drawn down to date.  The average value of loans drawn down is &euro;500.  From information gathered to date, sixty eight percent (68%) of loans are for amounts of &euro;500 or less, twenty eight percent (28%) are in the &euro;500 to &euro;1,500 range, with the balance of four percent (4%) in the upper &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 range.  The pilot is expected to be completed by the end of May 2016.  The findings of an evaluation report to be completed on the pilot scheme will help to inform the final scheme model to be rolled out nationwide, if the pilot is successful.    </p></reply>

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government. </p>  <p>  The current position is that the Department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseeker's payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week.  Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns. </p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the Department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post. </p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my Department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the Department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience. </p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the Department is that the majority of the Department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. </p>  <p>  The Department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible. </p>  <p>  Consequently the Department has written to its casual jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions. </p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the Department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices, they are issued directly to the Department&rsquo;s customers.  This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the Department and An Post. </p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the Department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The Department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment.  The Department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers. </p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.  Customers, if they wish, may continue to receive cheque payments in the medium term.</p></reply>

Where a returned emigrant does not qualify for a social insurance payment, he or she may apply for a social assistance payment, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for social welfare payments in Ireland an applicant must satisfy the eligibility criteria applicable to the scheme concerned.  In all cases, decisions on the eligibility of persons are made following consideration of all the circumstances of the person concerned.  In addition to having to satisfy a means test and other eligibility criteria directly relevant to the specific payment being claimed, applicants for most social assistance payments must also be determined as being habitually resident in the State in order to qualify.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s published guidelines on the application of the habitual residence condition specifically address the issue of returning emigrants.  Returning emigrants who have previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resume their long-term residence in the State may be determined as habitually resident in the State immediately on their return to the State.   </p>  <p>  Arrangements are in place with Safe-Home Ltd, a registered charity, to assist with any difficulty experienced by a minority of returning emigrants in demonstrating their intention to live in the State permanently for the purposes of satisfying the habitual residence condition.  </p>  <p>  The current Intreo decision process is designed to speed up decisions.  Persons applying for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or one-parent family payment would normally be given an early appointment to discuss their application.  Once the requested information is provided to support the application at the subsequent meeting with an official of the Department, there is usually minimal delay in processing the application to decision.  The  latest performance statistics available to the Department indicate that, on average, applications for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance take two weeks to process, while applications for one-parent family payment are processed within five weeks - reflecting the increased conditionality involved in qualifying for that payment.</p>  <p>  It is open to anyone who is dissatisfied with a decision on the application of the habitual residence condition in relation to entitlement to a social welfare payment to appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has information on a returned emigrant who is experiencing difficulty in accessing a social welfare payment, I will have the matter examined if he brings details of the case to my attention.</p></reply>

It is designed to be a temporary fixed-term activation intervention.  The programme assists participants to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills which can then be used in the workplace.</p><p>A number of persons who sign on to the Live Register generally exit it again within a short timeframe, without any recourse to employment schemes or intensive activation measures.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate that the CE scheme will remain focused on those who are long-term unemployed.  There are other interventions and activation options operated by the Department for those who are short-term unemployed, for example, advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools. </p><p>In general participants can avail of 12 months participation on CE.  There are no plans to extend the standard CE participation period up to two years minimum as this would result in a reduction in throughput from the scheme, thereby reducing the overall number of CE beneficiaries per year.</p><p>The standard minimum entry age for CE is 25 years of age.  It is worth noting that the entry age for dedicated childcare and health and social care positions that involve working <i>directly</i>with service users was lowered to 21 years of age.  There are no plans to further reduce the standard minimum entry for other positions. </p><p>With effect from 3<sup>rd</sup>April 2000, lifetime cumulative participation on CE by an individual is limited to 3 years (156 weeks) for persons under 55 years of age and 6 years (312 weeks) for persons of 55 years of age up to and including 65 years of age.  Eligible persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked Social Welfare payment are eligible for one additional year on CE over the standard maximum participation caps.  Participation on a CE scheme prior to 3<sup>rd</sup>April 2000 is not counted when calculating the length of time a person can participate.  There are no plans to change this date as the duration allows for maximum utilisation of the CE placements amongst the greatest number of participants.  </p><p>The CE programme provides funding for participants aged up to 65 years of age who meet the current eligibility criteria.  The T&aacute;naiste announced a pilot initiative in December 2015 to enable those aged 62 and over to extend their participation beyond the standard maximum participation limits (currently set at 6 years cumulative lifetime participation) providing the eligibility conditions are met.  Participants are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are limited to 7% of each scheme's overall budgeted places. </p><p>With respect to participation by lone parents on CE, in addition to the existing financial supports available, a number of other incentives are in place.  This includes the Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme.  As childcare is a crucial element for parents embarking on CE or returning to the workforce, this programme ensures that CE participants get the childcare supports they need to have a better future for themselves and their families. </p><p>The eligibility criteria for CE places is kept under ongoing review to ensure they are effective in targeting long-term unemployed jobseekers and other specific disadvantaged groups.  In the context of the Local Employment Service (LES) it is intended that they provide an intensive engagement with customers which includes a target of 30% of customers placed into full -time employment.  This target does not include those placed into education and training.  While CE schemes are intended to help long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce, they are not full-time sustainable jobs and cannot be included in this target.</p><p>If a particular CE scheme is encountering difficulties in recruiting participants, additional assistance can be provided by the local departmental staff to resolve any local barriers or issues.  The Department is committed to enhancing the effectiveness of the CE Programme whilst being conscious of the valuable contribution it is making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland. </p></reply>

The eligibility criteria are in line with the Government&rsquo;s policies to focus resources on maintaining the work readiness and employability of jobseekers on the live register.  In order to maintain this focus, persons not in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment from the Department are not eligible for selection for these initiatives. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note, however, that persons in receipt of disability allowance (DA), and certain other payments from the Department, are eligible for a range of other activation initiatives.  These include JobBridge, the rural social scheme, community employment, back to work and back to education allowances, as well as other education and training supports.  Additionally, a range of supports designed specifically to support people with disabilities and employers (to offer and maintain job opportunities for people with disabilities) are funded and delivered by the Department.

The Department does not record how cheques are realised by its customers.</p>  <p>   In view of the above the department is unable say how many customers cash their cheques at Post Offices. However, the evidence available to the department is that the majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 419,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016.  Increasing the spending on any of these schemes would have budgetary consequences requiring additional funds, and I am not in a position to do this at the present time. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources &ndash; this may include exceptional heating costs.</p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.  In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades.</p></reply>

In that regard, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides the main regulatory framework for the private rented residential sector and prescribes the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants and the Private Residential Tenancies Board is responsible for the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that thereÂ were 1,760 principal dwelling houses (PDH) properties and 668 buy-to-let (BTL) properties in the possession of banks at the end of December 2015.  However neither the Central Bank nor my own Department collect informationÂ about the occupancy ofÂ properties with mortgages that are in arrears.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware thatÂ relationship frameworks are in place with the State owned banks which provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions.  These frameworks are required to ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset for the State.</p>  <p>  In conclusion I would remind the Deputy that the GovernmentÂ strategy to deal with Mortgage Arrears has developed and been enhanced over recent years and over time additional measures have been introduced as the nature and circumstances of those in arrears has evolved.  Data released by the Central Bank shows that PDH arrears have declined for the last ten quarters.  However, a significant number of borrowers remain in arrears of more than two years and inÂ May of last yearÂ the Government announced a package of further measures to assist distressed borrowers.</p>  <p>  To date a cross-Departmental approach, led by the Department of the Taoiseach, has been adopted to address the problem of mortgage arrears, encompassing supervisory oversight of financial institutions by the Central Bank, significant reform to personal insolvency legislation, State-funded access to expert financial and legal advice for borrowers in arrears on their family home, and availability of a mortgage-to-rent option to enable eligible borrowers to remain in their homes as local authority, or approved housing body, tenants.</p></reply>

In the 12 months to March 2016, the growth in Dublin property prices was 3.9 per cent, compared with growth of 22.8 per cent over the same period in 2015. Â </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market, including house prices.  The Government remains committed to addressing the outstanding bottlenecks in the housing market.  In this regard the 'Stabilising Rents and Boosting Supply' package, announced in November 2015, includes a number of measures toÂ support sustainable growth in housing supply and provide greater stability in the rental market over the short run.  The package of measures builds upon and complements the Government's overall strategic approach to addressing bottlenecks in the housing market as set out in 'Construction 2020: A Strategy for A Renewed Construction Sector'.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives from the Small Firms Association,Â Irish Small and Medium EnterprisesÂ Association and Chambers IrelandÂ to discuss issues around access to finance.</p><p>AIB and Bank of Ireland are concentrating on growing their balance sheets. Â In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector.Â  The most recent Department of Finance SME credit demand survey, covering the period April-September 2015, shows that 85% of SME credit applications, Â excluding pending applications, were approved.  Further results from the survey can be found atÂ </p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit forÂ small and medium sizedÂ businesses.  The SME State Bodies GroupÂ provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.</p><p>Some of the mainÂ policies introduced to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:</p><p>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014.  On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.Â  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available atÂ </p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms then have recently been available on the Irish Market in recent times.  The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs.  It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs.  More information on the SBCI can be found onÂ .</p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.</p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.Â  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise OfficesÂ nationally to administer this fund ().</p><p>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.Â  They also examineÂ cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.Â  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The Credit Reviewer and his team have overturned more than 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.Â Â Further details are available atÂ .</p><p>My Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

The technical estimates provided illustrate the macro-fiscal outlook over the medium term on a no policy change basis relative to Budget 2016.  These estimates form a necessary mid-year input to the Semester process and must be provided ahead of formulating Budget 2017 when active policy decisions will be taken.  Estimates of fiscal space were not published in the document as it is submitted on a no policy change basis.</p>  <p>  Having said that I announced last Wednesday in this House that the estimated net fiscal space was of the order of &euro;10-&euro;11 billion over the period 2017 to 2021.  I also announced that there would be approximately &euro;900 million of net fiscal space available in 2017.Â  I stressed that both of these estimates are work-in-progress and subject to change; the calculations require inputs from the European Commission and these should be available shortly.</p>  <p>  At Budget time, my Department estimated a figure of &euro;8&frac12; billion net fiscal space for the period 2017 to 2021.  This was based on achieving a medium term budgetary objective or MTO of 0% of GDP by 2019.  As I made clear in a statement earlier this year,Â any relaxation of the MTO would add around &euro;1&frac12; billion to this figure; the MTO has now been revised.</p>  <p>  The remainder of the difference between the net fiscal space estimates provided in Budget 2016 and now is accounted for by other moving parts driving the estimation of the expenditure benchmark rule.  These factors include a higher GDP deflator, a stronger rate of potential GDP growth and a lower convergence margin relative to Budget time.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to a request from the Deputy last Wednesday I also said that my officials would be available to discuss technical issues related to the SPU;Â I understand thatÂ the Deputy has since been in contact with my officials and a meeting arranged.</p></reply>

The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own records.</p>  <p>  Given the scale of the task it was inevitable that a relatively small number of property records would be incorrectly associated with specific individuals.  Where such errors occurred tax payers were advised to contact Revenue as soon as possible to have the record amended.</p>  <p>  Regarding the case to which the Deputy is referring, the person in question was incorrectly linked as the liable person to the Local Authority property during the development of the Property Register.  The link was created on foot of data extracted from her PAYE records. Â Revenue was not made aware of the 'liable person' error or any change of address for the person over the intervening years.  As a consequence LPT correspondence, including a notification of deduction at source from her occupational pension in respect of the 2013 liability, continued to issue to her.</p>  <p>  In September 2015 Revenue became aware of a change of address for the person and that her PPSN was amended from an old format number to a new number.  Revenue amended her information on the Register, which resulted in her receiving LPT correspondence to her new address.  It was on foot of this correspondence that the Deputy's office made contact with the LPT team on her behalf.</p>  <p>  As soon as it was verified that the person was not the 'liable person' in respect of the property Revenue updated the Property Register to reflect the correct situation and recently refunded &euro;111.96, which was deducted from her occupational pension, to her.</p></reply>

The exemption only applies where the cost of the adaptation work exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it was adapted.</p>  <p>  Also, Section 15A of the LPT Act provides for a reduction in the market value by one valuation band where the property has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person, where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid by a local authority and where the adaptation increases the market value of the property.  The person with the disability must occupy the property as his/her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.</p>  <p>  The LPT Act also provides for a system of deferral and partial deferral arrangements where there is inability to pay and where certain specified conditions exist.  It is important to note that deferral/partial deferral is not an exemption and attaches as a charge on the property until the liability is paid.  The deferral/partial deferral option also attracts an annual interest charge of 4%.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it is aware of the specific case to which the Deputy is referring and has made a number of unsuccessful efforts to contact the person concerned.  Once contact is established with the person or the person's representative Revenue will provide all the relevant information and support on the various options available to assist the person to meet his/her LPT obligations.</p></reply>

It is open to KCC to undertake coastal erosion remedial works using its own resources.  If necessary, it may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications from local authorities are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;500,000 in each instance. Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. Full details are available on the OPW's website at: <i>.</i></p><p>No application from KCC has to date, been received, for the location specified.</p></reply>

As stated in the SPU It is envisaged that this level of spending pressure in 2016 can be accommodated within the fiscal rules.</p>  <p>  At this stage of the year, theÂ amounts of spending pressures by Department cannot be accurately assessed. However, the end-March Exchequer Returns provide some indications of areas where there may be some pressures. Â As outlined in the analysis of Gross Voted Expenditure published with the Exchequer Returns, at the end of the first quarter, Health gross current spending was over profile by &euro;38 million (1.1%).  This would indicate that there is a risk that Health may exceed the allocation set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV) 2016. </p>  <p>  Following the flooding in late 2015 and the early part of this year, it is estimated that an additional allocation for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be required this year to enable necessary recovery and repair work onÂ transport infrastructure.</p>  <p>  While not evident in the end quarter Exchequer returns, it can be anticipated that Departments will have demands for additional resources.  These demands can arise in relation to both current and capital expenditure.  For example, in the Education sector, re-phasing of funding for the school building programme to 2016 would allow earlier completion of some projects. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the aggregate level of spending pressures mayÂ be somewhatÂ mitigated by savings across Government Departments that can emerge later in the year.</p>  <p>  The estimates of fiscal space for the period 2017-2021 set out in Table A.9 of the Department of Finance's Budget 2016 publication sets out the walk between the gross fiscal space consistent with the forecast Expenditure Benchmark and the net fiscal space available over the medium term estimated at Budget time in October 2015 thatÂ after taking account, in relation to Voted expenditure, of:</p>  <p>  - projected expenditure pressures in Health, Education and Social Protection arising from demographics;</p>  <p>  - projected additional expenditure in Agriculture arising from the roll-out of the Rural Development Programme;</p>  <p>  - the projected carry over impact of certain Budget 2016 measures;</p>  <p>  - the capital expenditure increases in the Public Capital Plan; and</p>  <p>  - savings arising from expected lower numbers on the Live Register.</p>  <p>  Given that the fiscal space in Table A.9 of the Budget book is calculated by reference to the Expenditure Benchmark estimated in October 2015, additional expenditure in 2016 may become part of the base expenditure for 2017 and consequently should not be expected to impact on the fiscal space available for subsequent years.  However, as outlined above, expenditure pressures in 2016 may arise on both current and capital expenditure, and, given the favourable treatment of capital formation increases under the Expenditure Benchmark, any impacts on fiscal space can only be fully assessed when the full details of any additional expenditure in 2016 are available and also in light of consideration of theÂ impact of the General Government Finance statistics for 2015 recently publishedÂ by the CSO onÂ updated estimates of fiscalÂ space for 2017.Â </p></reply>

The provision of insurance cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are matters for individual insurers.  </p>  <p>  As I informed the Deputy in reply to his question on 14 April last on this subject, the Taoiseach, Tanaiste and other Ministers, including myself, met the CEOs of the insurance industry on 12 January of this year to communicate the benefits of flood defence schemes carried out by the Office of Public Works and to discuss the provision of flood insurance in areas protected by flood defence schemes.  Subsequently, Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry, advised that approximately 98% of property insurance policies nationally include flood cover and that in areas protected by flood defence schemes constructed by the Office of Public Works (OPW), 83% of policies include flood cover.  Insurance Ireland advised that the rate of cover is 89% in areas protected by fixed defences and 78% where the protection includes demountable defences. Demountable defences are used in four of the sixteen schemes that have been completed to the 1:100 year standard, required by the industry.  A further meeting of the OPW/Insurance Ireland Working Group on flood insurance (which also includes the Department of Finance) took place on 7 March, and a further meeting is scheduled for June.</p>  <p>  The subject of insurance against the risk of flooding is one of the issues being considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee which is developing whole-of-Government policies to support the OPW Flood Risk Management Plans.  In this context, officials of the Department of Finance are undertaking research in the area of flood insurance which will include an analysis of the different approaches to flood insurance taken in other countries.  This will then feed into a report from the Committee to Government which is expected to be completed before the summer.</p></reply>

These programmes are also a critical source of non-Exchequer funding for this important economic activity.  The current EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, which is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, is Horizon 2020.  Horizon 2020 has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Irish companies who compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn this will deliver strong national economic impacts. </p>  <p>  In the first 23 months of Horizon 2020, 588 Irish applicants were successful in securing funding.  For this period, Ireland's drawdown was &euro;251 million, giving an overall Irish success rate of 14.62% (higher than the EU Member State average of 13.5%).  Of this funding, over &euro;72 million went to companies and &euro;52 million of the &euro;72 million went to SMEs.</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;251 million drawdown, over &euro;9 million was for advanced manufacturing and processing.  It is not possible to disaggregate the total figure for supports for the manufacturing and services sectors as they are included in other calls, such as the SME Instrument.</p>  <p>  Ireland performed excellently in the previous Framework Programme, FP7, which ran over the period 2007- 2013.  Ireland&rsquo;s total drawdown in FP7 was &euro;625 million. Of this funding, industry had a drawdown of &euro;164 million and 72% of the industry total (&euro;118.5 million) was drawn down by SMEs.  The total figure for supports in the manufacturing and services sectors cannot be disaggregated from the total FP7 drawdown.</p>  <p>  Ireland has an ambitious target of winning &euro;1.25 billion under Horizon 2020, which we are on target to meet.  Our strategy to achieve this target is being driven by the Horizon 2020 High Level Group, chaired by my Department.  All Departments and Agencies engaged in research funding are represented on the High Level Group and particular attention is being given to maximising industry participation in Horizon 2020.</p>  <p>  80% of the Horizon 2020 budget (&euro;61 billion) is to be allocated between 2016 and 2020, which gives Irish companies the opportunity to continue to availing of these supports.  Irish academics and companies will continue to be supported in their engagement with the opportunities available by the Horizon 2020 National Support System.  The National Support System is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland and the National Director for Horizon 2020 leads a team comprised of representatives across the research funding departments and agencies.</p></reply>

A number of key policy and legislative initiatives were developed and delivered since March 2011 with some being reviewed and amended as necessary, and these may be grouped as follows:-</p><p><i>Credit Guarantees</i></p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Act 2012, and Schemes made thereunder, have resulted in encouragement of bank lending to Irish SMEs to both create new jobs and protect existing ones. To date approx. &euro;50 million of loans have been sanctioned in more than 300 facilities, and some 2200 jobs were created/maintained;</p><p>- The 2012 Act was reviewed in 2014-2015, and, in February of this year, the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act, 2016 was enacted. New Schemes are currently being drafted to extend the remit of credit guarantees (covering expanded forms of lending, and greater risk sharing), and introduce new counter guarantees to enhance the provision of both State and EU-sourced finance for Irish SMEs;</p><p><i>Microfinance Ireland (MFI)</i></p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund Act, 2012 established MFI to provide loans of up to &euro;25,000 to Irish micro-enterprises.  To date approx. &euro;13 million was been loaned to 870 firms, with more than 2000 jobs being created/maintained.</p><p>- As with credit guarantees, the operation of MFI was reviewed in 2015, and a number of changes were made to ease access to loans primarily, via the removal of the previous pre-requisite of a bank loan rejection. The legislative  changes have resulted in a substantial increase in the activities both nationally and regionally in the last year and a half. </p><p><i>Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI)</i></p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014 established the SBCI, and tasked it to provide up to &euro;800m of funds for Irish SMEs previously over reliant on bank financing.  This tranche of funding has now been fully committed to business.</p><p><i>Prompt Payments Code (PPC) </i></p><p>- In May 2015, the Government launched the PPC to encourage and promote best practice between businesses and suppliers and improve cash flow for businesses and, ultimately, drive a change in the payment culture in Ireland.</p><p><i>Credit Review Office</i></p><p>- The Credit Review Office continues to review applications for credit made by SMEs or Farm borrowers with viable business propositions who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank or Ulster Bank.</p><p>- The Credit Review Office also examines cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loans, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.</p><p>My Department Officials continue to work with other Departmental and Agency officials through the State Bodies Group chaired by the Department of Finance to ensure appropriate financing options are available to SMEs, and are currently continuing to work on developing an export finance strategy with the objective of delivering a product to market this year in line with commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 in this area.  In addition work is continuing on implementing a full range of actions in the finance for growth arena detailed in Chapter 7 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2016.</p><p>The Government will continuously monitor the availability of credit to our SMEs to ensure that our SMEs are well positioned to grow further in our recovering economy and continue to create further jobs.</p></reply>

I have now been advised by the SFPA that it can recommend that Renard Pier be designated for landings of Hake greater than 2 tonnes in accordance with the EU Control Regulation and the EU Hake Regulation.  The SFPA is also recommending that due account be given to the necessity to complete the construction works at Renard to allow safe access to both fishing vessels and SFPA inspection personnel while monitoring to landings of Hake greater than 2 tonnes into Renard by European Union fishing vessels.</p>  <p>  At present Renard Pier is under construction and a safety assessment will have to be made on completion of the works.

This involves day to day operational support by Harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure subject to available financial resources.  I am happy to advise the Deputy that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of &euro;5.9 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth FHC as part of my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2011 to 2015.</p>  <p>  On 11th January I announced funding of &euro;1.45 million for capital projects at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre during 2016; in addition I have set aside &euro;420,000 for safety and maintenance, disability access and contractual commitments accruing from 2015.  Significant works in this year&rsquo;s programme include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of pontoons to west pier for ferry landings and traffic management works.  Of importance in the context of a possible future dredging project at Howth is the allocation of &euro;100,000 for the preparation of a Dumping at Sea Licence which will be required before any dredging project could commence.</p>  <p>  A draft report from a &euro;150,000 site investigation project which was commissioned in 2015 was received in March 2016.  The draft report is being assessed by the Department&rsquo;s engineers.  This report includes vital information on the nature of the material to be dredged in any future dredging project.  This information is necessary for the preparation of the Dumping at Sea licence which will be submitted to the EPA in due course.  Depending on the outcome of this process Dredging Works will be considered subject to available funding.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, including a possible future dredging project at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future Capital Programmes on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing priorities.</p></reply>

These efforts are being reinforced at official level through similar contacts with other Member States and with the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee.</p>  <p>  In the course of such contacts I have pointed out that an exchange of offers is premature, and that any movement in these negotiations must be undertaken with great caution, and following a period of careful reflection and analysis.  This analysis must take into account the cumulative impact of concessions granted under other FTAs and the current forecasts for EU beef consumption.  I am also trying to ensure that tariff rate quotas are not dealt with at this early stage of the negotiations, and that when they are ultimately addressed, it will be in a manner that mitigates to the maximum possible extent the potential impact on the beef sector.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is of course the intention of the European Commission to ensure that public health and safety will not be put at risk as a result of the import of beef or any other product into the EU as a result of these or any other negotiations.  This position is supported by all Member States, including Ireland.</p></reply>

However in the absence of economic data it is difficult to determine what the industry can contribute. My Department has committed to carry out a comprehensive economic analysis of the harness racing industry to determine its current and potential return to the Irish economy, which will require the commissioning of an independent economic consultant. My Department is at present deciding on the terms of reference for such a study.</p>  <p>  In the meantime the Association has been approved for funding of &euro;21,704 from the Equine Infrastructure grant scheme operated by my Department. This funding has been approved in respect of projects to develop the association&rsquo;s Breeding database and website, having a presence at the 2016 RDS Horse Show, attendance at a Trotteur conference in France and initiatives to develop further links with relevant international organisations. In addition a further IHRA project, with a focus on equine welfare, has been recently approved by my Department.</p>  <p>  My Department has also assisted the Irish Harness Racing Association by facilitating engagement with Horse Racing Ireland which resulted in the Association getting permission to use Dundalk Racecourse for a number of fixtures. </p></reply>

Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of information on the courts system.  I am informed that the Courts Service does not receive or record information in such a way as to determine if a property is vacant or non-vacant prior to a possession order being made.  However, statistics in relation to the number of possession orders made in respect of properties are available on the Courts Service website, www.courts.ie.</p><p>It is important to note that the number of civil bills issued does not reflect either the number of orders for possession granted or necessarily equate with repossessions as it is up to the person or company who obtained the order for possession to pursue its execution.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>Therefore, relative to the number of civil bills issued, a small portion end up as repossessions since in many cases the civil bill gives rise to engagement of the borrower with the bank resulting in either a mortgage  restructuring agreement between the bank and borrower or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement entered into under the Personal Insolvency Act.</p><p>The Central Bank's quarterly Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossession Statistics have information which may be of interest to the Deputies and they are available at www.centralbank.ie.  The statistics include the number of properties taken into possession by lenders during the relevant quarter including the number which were repossessed on foot of a Court Order.</p><p>I would like to refer the Deputies to the range of measures that have already been put in place under the Government's Framework to Strengthen Support of Mortgage Arrears with the aim of providing assistance for people in mortgage arrears, including:</p><p>- the enactment on 28 July 2015 of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, and commencement on 20 November 2015 of the new Court review under section 115A, where banks refuse a personal insolvency proposal on the borrower&rsquo;s home; </p><p>- the development of Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) as the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop shop&rsquo; point of information and guidance for homeowners in mortgage arrears, working closely with the Insolvency Service;</p><p>- the establishment and staffing of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS centres, in key locations with nationwide coverage, with specialised expertise on mortgage debt; and</p><p>- the presence of MABS and the Insolvency Service at courthouses to provide information and &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; support for householders issued with repossession proceedings against their homes (operating nationwide since 1 October, after successful pilot in July 2015).  This initiative is facilitated by the Courts Service, and is currently provided for all Circuit Court repossession hearings. </p><p>In addition, the Government will shortly be putting in place a new Government-funded Scheme to help people who are insolvent, and in mortgage arrears on their home, to access independent expert financial and legal advice. The scheme has 3 components:</p><p>(i) Provision of financial advice and assistance. </p><p>This involves the provision of advice and assistance from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, or other financial adviser as appropriate, drawn from panels agreeing to provide specified levels and amounts of services under the Scheme at fixed cost.  This will be provided without cost to an insolvent borrower, under a &lsquo;voucher&rsquo; system, and will be accessed through MABS, working in conjunction with the Insolvency Service and the accountancy bodies. </p><p>(ii) Provision of legal advice and assistance.</p><p>This involves the provision of advice and assistance from a solicitor, drawn from panels to be set up by the Legal Aid Board, who agrees to provide specified levels and amounts of services under the Scheme at fixed cost.  The scheme will provide assistance and representation for insolvent borrowers in repossession proceedings involving their home, via a panel of &lsquo;duty solicitors&rsquo; at repossession hearings, operated by the Legal Aid Board. </p><p>Again, this assistance will be provided without cost to an insolvent borrower, under a &lsquo;voucher&rsquo; system, and will be accessed through MABS, working in conjunction with the Legal Aid Board.</p><p>(iii) Provision of legal aid.</p><p>This involves the provision of legal aid for insolvent borrowers seeking the new Court review under section 115A Personal of the Insolvency Acts, where a borrower&rsquo;s proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement including mortgage arrears on their home is refused by their creditors.  This component will be operated by the Legal Aid Board. </p><p>The overall objective of the Scheme is to help people who are insolvent (unable to pay their debts in full as they fall due), and are in serious mortgage arrears on their homes, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, which will help them to find the best possible solutions, with the aim of remaining in their homes where possible.</p></reply>

It was introduced in acknowledgment that prisoners must have access to a credible and robust system that deals with genuine complaints in an open, transparent, and independent way.  </p>  <p>  The system is categorised depending on the nature of the complaint.  Category A complaints concern the most serious level of complaint (assault, serious intimidation by staff etc.).  Category B complaints include allegations of discrimination, verbal abuse by officers and inappropriate searches.  Category C complaints are essentially service complaints where a prisoner is unhappy with the level of service in a particular prison.  Category D complaints are those alleging misconduct or mistreatment by professionals providing services to prisoners such as doctors, dentists etc.</p>  <p>  To support and give effect to these new complaint procedures the then Minister announced amendments to the Prison Rules in January 2013.  In the main, the amendments provide that prisoner complaints under Category A will be examined by investigators from outside the Prison Service to ensure an effective and impartial investigation.  The complainant is to be kept informed and the reports by outside investigators are automatically submitted to the Governor in question, the Director General and the Inspector of Prisons.  The Inspector has had oversight of the process from the very beginning which was also strengthened by extra resources assigned to his office. </p>  <p>  A panel of 22 Independent Investigators was established following a selection and interview process.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, in addition to the complaints system described above, a prisoner may make a complaint about treatment in custody through a number of other channels, including the Prison Visiting Committee and the Inspector of Prisons.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Inspector of Prisons, who is independent of Government, has carried out a review of the prisoner complaints procedure currently in operation in the Irish Prison Service and has made a number of recommendations, including one relating to a possible role for an Ombudsman.  My officials and I are currently examining those recommendations.</p></reply>

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships,  alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  </p>  <p>  I therefore understand the Deputy's question to relate to organised criminal groups.</p>  <p>  In this regard, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to  ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime. </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not.     </p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the situation internationally, the question of how best to deal with participation in and/or directing a criminal organisation through the criminal law has been the subject of debate in the development of common international standards. Relevant international instruments to which Ireland is a party are the European Union Council Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA on the fight against organised crime and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.  State Parties to these instruments are required to give effect to the measures set out therein.  Ireland has done so through domestic criminal law including the legislation outlined above.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the overall number of personnel available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the 29 February 2016 was close to 16,000 comprising 12,785 Garda&iacute;, 932 Garda Reserve members and over 2,000 civilians. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate it is vital that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is renewed in order to ensure that it has the capacity to provide effective and visible policing throughout the country.  With this objective in mind, there have been seven intakes of Garda Trainees to the Garda College since it was reopened in September 2014 giving a total intake of 700.  A further 450 will be taken in this year.  So far 395 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties in communities nationwide.</p>  <p>  It is expected that a further 300 Garda Trainees will attest by the end of this year which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act and the legal aid system does not record whether or not persons granted legal aid are hardened criminals or members of criminal gangs.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.</p><p>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325</i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;.</i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p></reply>

The balance between armed and unarmed members of the organisation, is of course, kept under review in the light of emerging challenges.  In this regard, at the request of the Commissioner earlier this year, the Government  moved decisively to strengthen the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with gang related crime in the Dublin area through a special allocation of &euro;5 million to support the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit in Dublin amongst other measures.  Work is progressing as a matter of priority on the establishment of that unit. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Taoiseach and I recently met with senior Garda management and were briefed on the significant progress being made in investigations into recent gang-related murders in the Dublin region.  As these appalling crimes are the subject of ongoing Garda investigations it would not be appropriate for me to make any more detailed comment at this time, however, I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary resources to pursue the robust strategy which the Commissioner and her senior officers have put in place to oppose the violent thugs who have perpetrated such heinous crimes in our Capital City.  The Garda response includes highly visible policing, the use of armed checkpoints and targeted and intelligence based operations, with a view to disrupting and preventing incidents as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  These measures are in addition to the intensive Garda recruitment programme which is currently underway.</p><p>The recent investments in Garda resources are also supporting a wider countrywide drive against crime under Operation Thor and there will be ongoing support for anti-crime measures due to the very significant resources committed in the Capital Plan 2016-2021.  This Plan includes an allocation of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community.  In addition, the Government is investing in enhanced Garda technology and ICT systems with an additional &euro;205 million allocated for Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan. </p><p>I might add that heavy penalties are provided for weapons offences in our criminal law and mandatory minimum penalties have been introduced for certain firearms offences.  The considerable powers already available to Garda&iacute; have been supplemented further by the newly established DNA Database which will have the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist Garda&iacute; in investigating serious gun crimes and a whole range of other serious offences.</p><p>Needless to say there are enormous difficulties in counteracting those who are determined to perpetuate a cycle of mindless violence without any regard to human life of public safety.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have in the past successfully faced-down gangs who believed they were above the law.  I trust that all in this House will agree that the State must continue to take all appropriate measures to oppose and dismantle criminal gang networks and to disrupt the evil drugs trade which is at the heart of much of their activities.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The number of children availing of the programme will increase from approximately 67,000 per year to 127,000 per year following the full roll out of the expanded pre-school provision.  </p>  <p>  Last year, I established the Inter-Departmental Group to consider options for future investment in early years and after-school childcare and to set out a range of options for future investment which would enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years and after-school childcare.  </p>  <p>  Several recommendations of the Group, including a number which relate to after-school childcare, were considered as part of the Estimates process for the Budget and will also be funded in 2016. These include a &euro;3 million capital fund, which will be provided to enable both community/not-for-profit and private providers to develop after-school childcare services using existing school and other accessible community facilities. The terms and conditions for this &euro;3 million capital fund are currently being drafted. </p>  <p>  A number of support programmes are implemented by this Department to support parents to access quality after-school childcare services.  These include:</p>  <p>  - The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school. The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child. </p>  <p>  - The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case. The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks. Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  - The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  - The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.</p></reply>

I gather that the CRA sent a copy to each member of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Report Card is an established accountability tool for the CRA and its more than 100 member organisations through which it has, since 2009, scrutinised progress on the commitments to children in the Programme for Government. The most recent Report Card explores progress during 2015 against commitments in the 2011-2016 Programme for Government. </p><p>Each year, the CRA evaluates Government's delivery of its promises in six key areas - children's constitutional rights, the right to education, to health, to an adequate standard of living, to protection from abuse and neglect and the right to equality and non-discrimination. The grading is carried out by a high-level independent panel, comprising some of Ireland's leading experts in children's rights, child law, education, early years and from the trade union sector. The Report Card also provides an important resource for politicians, policy makers, service providers and non-governmental organisations and academics. The recommendations contained therein traverse the remits of my colleagues across other Government Departments as well as covering issues under the direct remit of my Department.</p><p>I would also note that a considerable number of recommendations are reflected in the commitments contained within <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, with responsibility for implementation again falling to the respective Government Departments. My Department is responsible for monitoring progress on the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures</i>and supporting its key implementation structures across Departments and sectors. An annual report on progress towards those commitments to April 2015 was published in 2015 with the second report covering the following year to April 2016 currently in preparation.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that the CRA recently contacted the Secretary General in my Department to arrange a meeting to discuss issues arising from the Report Card 2016. A meeting is being arranged for the coming weeks. In addition, the Department engaged in a funding arrangement with the CRA in 2015 to support the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</i>The Department has recently received correspondence from the CRA with regard to an ongoing funding support. This proposal is under active consideration. This funding arrangement recognises the work of the CRA in the areas of consultation, representation and consensus building, which has in turn supported the work and shared objectives of my Department.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2016, funding of &euro;51m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. </p><p>In 2016, an amount of &euro;500,405 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland, an increase of more than &euro;12,000 on the 2015 allocation. My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.</p><p>In addition, &euro;2.6m in capital funding has been allocated to my Department for 2016. In the main, this funding will be used to support smaller scale projects, such as refurbishments, health and safety works, and accessibility improvements in youth services. Details of the capital grant scheme are available from my Department's website, www.dcya.gov.ie.</p><p>I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet, regularly with many voluntary organisations and groups providing services to children and young people to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs. Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the development of the policies and services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning. Most recently, on 28th April 2016 I and officials from my Department met with representatives of over 30 national and major regional voluntary youth organisations that work with children and young people, throughout the country. The purpose of the meeting was to provide an opportunity to share knowledge and information about developments to support the provision of services to secure improved outcomes for children and young people.</p><p>The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020, published last October was developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people. The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  The implementation structures established by my Department under <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures </i>will oversee the roll-out of the National Youth Strategy.</p><p>National voluntary organisations that work with children and young people are represented at the Advisory Council for the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Future</i>.</p><p>At local level, Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards have an important support role on behalf of my Department, to local youth services. My Department works closely with them to address issues that arise for local services. Officials of my Department met Kildare Youth Services and have visited their Kildare Youth Service to hear about their work and their proposals, for the provision of services in County Kildare.</p></reply>

It was the case that only children who satisfied the age criteria in September could access the programme during the following school year.</p><p>In Budget 2016, I announced a significant expansion the pre-school provision under the ECCE programme.  This measure, which will be introduced  from September 2016, means that children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they reach the age of 3, and continue to avail of free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the pre-school year i.e. end June).  Following the introduction of the expanded programme there will be three opportunities each year - in September, January and April - for eligible children to enrol for the free pre-school provision.  This will ensure that children aged 3 or over have the opportunity to enrol as soon as possible after their third birthday.</p><p>This extension of the Programme will increase the number of children availing of free pre-school from about 67,000 p.a to 127,000 in a given programme year.</p><p>I was conscious also of the difficulty experienced by some children with a disability in accessing and benefiting fully from the ECCE Programme.  To address this issue, I announced in Budget 2016 the necessary funding to implement a new practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability.  The model will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These are:-</p><p>i.An Inclusive Culture</p><p>ii.  Information for Parents and Providers</p><p>iii. A Qualified and Confident Workforce</p><p>iv.  Expert Educational Advice &amp;amp; Support</p><p>v.Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations</p><p>vi.  Therapeutic Intervention</p><p>vii.  Additional Assistance (where the supports available at levels 1-6 are not sufficient to meet a child&rsquo;s needs).</p><p>Work on the detailed design and implementation of the new model for meeting the needs of children with a disability is at an advanced stage.  The view is to introduce the initiative from September 2016.  It is intended that service providers and parents will be able to submit applications for supports under the new model from June 2016 onwards to allow them to plan for pre-school enrolment in September 2016 and to ensure that children will begin to benefit from these measures from that point forward.</p><p>The new measures which I am introducing will ensure that all children in Ireland from the age of 3 years will be able to access free education, either in pre-school or in primary school, which is a significant step forward for children and families.</p></reply>

A  95% target of appropriate placements in Child and Adolescent Units is indicated in the Plan, to allow for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units.  While it remains challenging for the HSE to meet this ambitious target progress on this important area has been significant despite increasing demands generally on CAMHS service.  This is underscored by the fact that there were 247 such admissions to adult units in 2008, and 95 admissions in 2015.  It is a priority for the HSE to keep such admissions to a minimum, and this is kept under constant review.</p><p>I have prioritised developing all aspects of CAMHS, including timely access to appropriate services, early intervention and an integrated service approach.  Additional resources and facilities means that we now have 67 CAMHS Teams, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams, supported by 66 operational  CAMHS beds across the country.  This includes the extra 8 CAMHS beds recently opened in the new Linn Dara Unit in Dublin, which is helping to decrease pressures on CAMHS admissions to adult units.  Further CAMHS beds are scheduled to open in the system.</p><p>The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of CAMHS services are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion, including improved access to age appropriate units.  Last year, the Executive introduced a new <b>Standard Operating Procedure</b>for both in-patient and community CAMHS services.  This has contributed to improving services overall, including reducing inappropriate admissions of adolescents to adult units.  It is designed also to reduce CAMHS Waiting Lists, particularly for those waiting over 12 months.  </p><p>Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the HSE is making real progress in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy, while taking account of the wishes of each young person, their parents or guardians, and the complexities of each case.  In many instances, a multi-disciplinary or inter-agency approach is required.  The Department will continue to closely monitor this issue, in conjunction with the HSE, to ensure that the various new initiatives now underway, will contribute to improving CAMHS services, including the rate of age appropriate admissions across all regions.</p></reply>

A  95% target of appropriate placements in Child and Adolescent Units is indicated in the Plan to allow for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units.  While it remains challenging for the HSE to meet this ambitious target progress on this important area has been significant despite increasing demands generally on CAMHS service.  This is underscored by the fact that there were 247 such admissions to adult units in 2008, and 95 admissions in 2015.  It is a priority for the HSE to keep such admissions to a minimum, and this is kept under constant review.</p><p>I have prioritised developing all aspects of CAMHS, including timely access to appropriate services, early intervention and an integrated service approach.  Additional resources and facilities means that we now have 67 CAMHS Teams, and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams, supported by 66 operational CAMHS beds across the country.  This includes the extra 8 CAMHS beds recently opened in the new Linn Dara Unit in Dublin, which is helping to decrease pressures on CAMHS admissions to adult units.  Further CAMHS beds are scheduled to open in the system.</p><p>The HSE is committed to ensuring that all aspects of CAMHS services are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion, including improved access to age appropriate units.  Last year, the Executive introduced a new <b>Standard Operating Procedure</b>for both in-patient and community CAMHS services.  This has contributed to improving services overall, including reducing inappropriate admissions of adolescents to adult units.  It is designed also to reduce CAMHS Waiting Lists, particularly for those waiting over 12 months.  </p><p>Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the HSE is making real progress in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy, while taking account of the wishes of each young person, their parents or guardians, and the complexities of each case.  In many instances, a multi-disciplinary or inter-agency approach is required.  The Department will continue to closely monitor this issue, in conjunction with the HSE, to ensure that the various new initiatives now underway, will contribute to improving CAMHS services, including the rate of age appropriate admissions across all regions.</p></reply>

I can clarify to the Deputy that the health legislation does not have a provision for the HSE to award a medical card to persons by virtue of an illness or a medical condition.  However, where an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the qualifying financial thresholds, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; Report of the <i>Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>, which made a recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.</p><p>I would like to advise the Deputy that it is important to note that where a medical card is withdrawn - irrespective of its having been awarded based solely on means or where the HSE has exercised discretion - it is not withdrawn due on the cost implications for the HSE.  In accordance with the Health Acts, a medical card can only be withdrawn due to eligibility not having been established. </p><p>As the medical condition of the applicant is not a factor in the assessment process for medical cards under the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE does not record data on the GMS Database of this nature.</p></reply>

A core part of this programme has been the rationalisation of the NAS command and control function from local regional centres to one national centre, the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), operating across two sites in Dublin and Ballyshannon.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the NEOC was undertaken in order to ensure that the ambulance service operates as a national fleet, rather than in regional divisions.  Staff working in the NEOC operate using an integrated platform which enables them to have sight of every ambulance resource in the country.  This means that they can deploy resources accordingly and ensure that the nearest available resource is dispatched to the patient within minutes of receipt of the call.  This level of co-ordination and deployment of resources was not possible under the localised regional call centre configuration which existed previously.</p>  <p>  The service is moving away from the model of care where services are provided to a local area from a fixed ambulance base located in that area, and moving to a model of strategic deployment, where paramedics and advanced paramedics are deployed in a manner which ensures that practitioners with the appropriate skill level are located strategically to provide optimum cover.  Cover is provided across the Southern region from NAS bases in Killarney, Dingle, Listowel, Cahirciveen, Kenmare and Tralee.  Resources are deployed to incidents as required in accordance with the system of Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch Protocols and are not confined to a specific geographic area.</p></reply>

The Group has been overseeing initiatives to address ED overcrowding and ED performance, particularly over this peak winter period. </p>  <p>  Measures implemented included optimising discharges in advance of the weekends, strengthening the senior decision making presence at wards and in Emergency Departments, increased diagnostics at the weekends and securing staff to open overflow areas.  As a result of these measures, the ED performance over the Easter period was favourable compared with 2015. </p>  <p>  During 2015, additional funding of &euro;117 million was provided to the HSE to relieve ED overcrowding pressures.  This funding has supported initiatives to expand hospital capacity with 364 additional beds opened or reopened, reduce the number of hospital attendances by expanding community intervention team services and increasing the availability of community hospitals, and support timely patient discharge from hospital by reducing the wait time for Fair Deal funding to no more than 4 weeks, providing additional transitional care places, public community beds and home care packages. </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of 2016, the HSE has reported an increase in emergency department (ED) activity in comparison with the same period last year.  Overall, there has been an increase of 6.9% in patient attendances.  Despite sustained increase in attendances, the total year to date number of patients waiting on trolleys at 8am each morning shows a marginal increase of 1%.</p>  <p>  This year, the HSE is focusing on a number of key activities to manage waiting lists more effectively, thereby improving patient waiting times. These include:</p>  <p>  - ensuring that chronological scheduling is adhered to; </p>  <p>  - putting in place administrative and clinical validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment; </p>  <p>  - relocating high-volume low complexity surgeries to smaller hospitals; and </p>  <p>  - designating an improvement lead for each hospital group, to provide support in meeting national targets for appointments and treatment.</p></reply>

In January 2015, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for in-patient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 Jun 2015 and 15 months by year end.  The HSE was provided with additional funding to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved by maximising capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs. HSE figures for end December 2015 show positive progress against the 15 months maximum wait time.  For in-patient and day case waiting lists, overall performance equates to 95% achievement of the 15 month maximum permissible wait time and for outpatient waiting lists, overall performance equates to 93% achievement of the 15 month maximum permissible wait time.</p><p>This year, the HSE will focus on a number of activities to manage patient waiting times, including:</p><p>- ensuring that chronological scheduling is adhered to; </p><p>- putting in place administrative and clinical validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment; </p><p>- relocating high-volume low complexity surgeries to smaller hospitals;</p><p>- outsourcing a percentage of patients where there is limited capacity to treat them in the public system; and</p><p>- designating an improvement lead for each hospital group, to provide support in meeting national targets for appointments and treatment.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p>  <p>  The HSE faces a continuing challenge to deliver services in a way that will minimise any adverse impact on patients and continue to protect, as far as possible, the most vulnerable citizens. Unfortunately, as a result it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of items reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes.  This includes gluten-free products. </p>  <p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies. Coeliac patients can also claim medical expenses tax relief on expenditure incurred on gluten-free products manufactured specifically for coeliacs. There are no plans to reinstate these products on the list of reimbursable items under the GMS and other community drug schemes.</p></reply>

These initiatives include optimising discharges in advance of the weekends, strengthening the senior decision making presence at wards and in EDs, increased access to diagnostics and securing staff to open overflow areas.</p>  <p>  During 2015, additional funding of &euro;117 million was provided to the HSE to relieve ED overcrowding pressures.  This funding has supported initiatives to expand hospital capacity with 364 additional beds opened or reopened, reduce the number of hospital attendances by expanding community intervention team services and increasing the availability of community hospitals, and support timely patient discharge from hospital by reducing the wait time for Fair Deal funding to no more than 4 weeks, providing additional transitional care places, public community beds and home care packages.</p>  <p>  Since the beginning of 2016, the HSE has reported an increase of 6.9% in patient attendances in comparison with the same period last year. However, the total year to date number of patients waiting on trolleys at 8am each morning has shown a marginal increase of 1%.</p>  <p>  This year, the HSE is focusing on a number of key activities to manage waiting lists more effectively, thereby improving patient waiting times. These include; ensuring that chronological scheduling is adhered to, putting in place validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment, relocating high-volume low complexity surgeries to smaller hospitals; and designating an improvement lead for each hospital group.</p>  <p>  With respect to possible underutilisation of surgical beds, the ED escalation framework states that reviews of elective admissions should be carried out by hospital management in consultation with the relevant consultant. It is only at Stage 3 of escalation that all admissions are to be carried out through the Emergency Department and that elective surgeries are cancelled.</p>  <p>  Stage 3 requires that elective staff are redeployed to assist with patient flow through the ED. This can impact on staffing and bed capacity in surgical wards. Taking into account the immediate and short term predictable demand/capacity scenario, decisions on hospital admissions and bed management have to be taken with regard to the safe operating limits of the hospital as a whole and in the interests of patient care.</p></reply>

It is important that consideration be given to how best to provide public funding for fertility treatment in conjunction with closing the legislative gap in this area of healthcare. To that end, my officials are currently drafting a General Scheme of legislative provisions dealing with AHR.</p>  <p>  I have commissioned an evidence review of international public funding models. The review will inform policy regarding the ideal mechanism for any future public funding of AHR in the State. It is expected that the evidence review will be completed before the end of 2016 and that once the AHR legislation is enacted the Government will be in a position to provide fertility treatments based on the best model of funding for Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that while in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment is not provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE). Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

Currently 9 of the 14 designated professions have registration boards and registers have been established for 7 of them.</p>  <p>  Psychotherapists and counsellors are not currently regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, by regulation, designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is appropriate and in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Act, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council has been consulted on the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists.  Its detailed report on the matter is being examined carefully in the Department of Health with a view to deciding the next steps in the coming months.  These steps will, I envisage, include a wider round of consultation involving the various professional bodies and other interested parties.</p>  <p>  While the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist are not specifically designated under the 2005 Act, there are various regulatory controls on many counsellors and psychotherapists operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The profession of psychologist, for example, is a designated profession under the 2005 Act which means that those psychologists who are counsellors and/or psychotherapists will begin to be regulated when the Psychologists Registration Board, which is due to be established later this year, opens its register.</p>  <p>  Psychiatrists, some of whom practice psychotherapy, are regulated under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  Also, counsellors/therapists working in the publicly funded health sector are required to have minimum qualifications set by the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Patients apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish-based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that, in the case detailed by the Deputy, an application under the Scheme was assessed and a decision letter issued to the patient and her referring consultant which identified how the application did not meet the criteria of the Scheme.  The letter set out the appeals process in respect of the decision on the application, including the recommendation when making an appeal to submit all supporting clinical information of relevance to the case.  Members of the TAS office have subsequently spoken with the patient and again outlined the appeals process and also gave the patient advice on the options of making a new application or applying for care under the Cross Border Healthcare Directive.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18 November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll-out of the new inclusive preschools model.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional pre-school supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case she has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

In advance of registration inspections, HIQA sends posters and information leaflets to registered centres so that residents and their families are aware that inspectors will be there should they wish to speak to them.  Because of the nature of unannounced inspections, it is not possible to give residents or their families advance notice of the inspection; however, inspectors are always interested and willing to hear the views of families.  There have been instances where families were not able to meet inspectors at the time of inspection but have phoned HIQA and spoken to inspectors at a later date.</p>  <p>  The views of residents are very important in any inspection and inspectors seek opportunities to speak to residents.  Where residents are not able to verbally express their views, inspectors spend time with them observing the quality of their day-to-day interactions and supports.  Inspectors consider the views of residents when making their findings; however, HIQA also acknowledges that the resident&rsquo;s voice in inspection reports could be enhanced.  HIQA is currently reviewing how it reports on the findings of its inspections, particularly in this regard.</p></reply>

A finding of the report was that people who have private health insurance can access diagnostic services more quickly than those in the public system.  The report also states that 'there were no significant findings when comparing average delay in the public system to distance from GP practice to nearest hospital for referral'. </p>  <p>  The report acknowledges the significant contribution to cancer control in Ireland arising from the establishment of the National Cancer Control Programme, the designation of cancer centres and the development of rapid access clinics for patients with suspected breast, prostate and lung cancers.</p></reply>

The EU and Turkey have engaged deeply on developing joint approaches and the EU&rsquo;s engagement with Turkey was the focus of the most recent European Council on 17 and 18 March 2016.</p><p>The core intention of the EU-Turkey agreement which emerged from the Council is to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable.  Critically, it should stop people getting into unsafe boats and risking their lives.  The need to comply with international law was at the heart of the discussions leading to the Agreement.</p><p>All migrants will be protected in accordance with the relevant international standards and in respect of the principle of <i>non-refoulement.</i>The EU and Turkey have agreed that there will be no blanket returns and no automatic returns of asylum seekers: all migrants/refugees arriving in Greece who wish to claim asylum will have their applications processed individually by the Greek authorities in accordance with the Asylum Procedures Directive, in cooperation with the European Asylum Support Office (EASO).  In addition, the &euro;3 billion Facility for refugees in Turkey is aimed at supporting Syrians and other refugees by providing access to food, shelter, education, and healthcare.  This funding has been accelerated and, as of 19 April, &euro;187 million has been committed to the Facility. </p><p>Steps to address the migration challenge are also continuing outside of the EU-Turkey framework.  In addition to the humanitarian aid provided by Ireland, we agreed last year to accept up to 4,000 migrants, despite our opt-out from EU legislation in the area of freedom, security and justice.  Last year the Irish Naval service rescued 8,592 migrants from the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>More broadly, the issue of human rights in Turkey has been raised by the Taoiseach at the European Council and continues to form an integral part of the country&rsquo;s Enlargement process.</p></reply>

In 2014 we co-sponsored a resolution calling for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court which was vetoed by Russia and China. Our support for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court remains unchanged. I would also note that the UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry has reported that the Assad regime is responsible for the majority of crimes against the Syrian people.  The High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded in his March 2015 report that, subject to a determination by an independent and competent court, ISIS may have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. We echo his call that, in order to provide accountability and justice for the victims, all crimes are investigated in line with international human rights standards, and perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>  <p>  Determining the validity of claims of genocide by ISIS/Daesh is a matter which should be undertaken by a legally competent court. I believe that this is a matter for decision by the International Criminal Court. </p></reply>

The outcome of these demographic analyses was that on 17 November 2015 I announced the establishment of 4 new primary schools and 9 new post-primary schools to open in 2017 and 2018, including a new post-primary school which will open in September 2018 to serve the Dublin South City Centre area, which includes the areas to which the Deputy refers.  </p><p>  The patronage determination process for new schools is a separate process, which is run after it is decided that, based on the demographic data, a new school is required. Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular type of school. It is open to all patrons, patron bodies and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of a new school under this process.</p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have recently issued an invitation to all patron bodies and prospective school patron bodies to apply for the patronage of the nine new post primary schools including the school to serve Dublin South City Centre area.

Voluntary contributions may be sought from parents, provided it is made clear to parents that there is no compulsion to pay and that a child's place in the school or continued enrolment is not dependant on a willingness to make a contribution.</p><p>  Registration fees are sometimes requested by schools in order to avoid &quot;double booking&quot; of pupils in schools. Under current arrangements, schools are allowed to request a booking fee/registration fee when considering applicants for enrolment, provided this is refundable at all times following a decision on enrolment.</p><p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April of last year, contained a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions as part of the school admission process or for continued enrolment in the school. Unfortunately, it was not possible to bring this complex piece of legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas in the timeframe available. However, I have made it clear that a legislative framework for school admissions needs to be a priority for the next government.</p></reply>

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent. </p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.  It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants.  An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-04a.787.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016050400087#WRZ02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 to 271, inclusive, together.</p><p>The EU co-financed Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) aims to tackle youth unemployment and implement the Youth Guarantee by providing job, education and training opportunities to young people aged 15-25 who are not in employment, education of training.  YEI funding is reserved for use in those regions, including Ireland, where youth unemployment levels exceeded 25% during the reference year of 2012.  The specific YEI funding allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our European Social Fund (ESF) allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.</p><p>The YEI is integrated into ESF programming and is being delivered in Ireland as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Education, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.  Seven specific actions are being funded under the YEI, namely the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge; JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach; Social Inclusion and Activation Programme; and Momentum.  The proposed funding allocations for each of these actions, including YEI funding, is set out in the following table. These actions are underway and are being fully funded up-front by the Exchequer. </p><p>In accordance with the ESF Regulations, following the adoption of the PEIL in 2015, initial pre-financing of 3.5%, and annual pre-financing of 2% for 2016, of the EU support for the YEI priority axis, amounting to some &euro;7.5m has been received to date.Separately, additional initial pre-financing of &euro;19.8m, to bring the rate to 30% in 2015 of the YEI allocation, has also been received.  This additional funding was provided in line with EU Regulation 799 of 2015 which was introduced in response to budgetary constraints faced by Member States and the urgent need to address youth unemployment.  However, in an attempt to ensure that the funding was used for the immediate implementation of the YEI, the Regulation provides that if a Member State does not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.</p><p>In accordance with the Regulations governing the European Structural and Investment Funds (including the ESF and the YEI), the relevant managing and certifying authorities for the Operational Programme must be designated, based on the opinion of an independent audit body which must be satisfied across a range of criteria that systems are in place to allow the authorities to perform their required functions, prior to the making of any application for an interim payment under the Regulations.  The systems designation requirements include the provision of a computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements.  The Regulations require Member States to ensure that all exchanges of information between beneficiaries and the relevant authorities and intermediate bodies can be carried out by means of electronic data exchange systems (known as E-Cohesion).  These systems will facilitate interoperability with national and Union frameworks and allow for the beneficiaries to submit information only once.</p><p>Ireland is developing a national IT system to meet the 2014-2020 ESIF requirements.  A Project Board, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as the Department with lead responsibility, is overseeing the delivery of this system.  A tender for the development of the system was published in March and the deadline for the receipt of applications was Friday, 29 April.  It is expected that the system will &quot;go-live&quot; in December.</p><p>The intention is that the ESF authorities will be designated later this year and that a claim for an interim payment under the PEIL will be made in 2017.  Accordingly, as Ireland will not comply with the relevant Regulatory requirement of making an interim claim in May 2016, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received and currently held in a Suspense Account, may be reimbursed to the Commission. </p><p>However, it should be noted that the reimbursement of this pre-financing will not result in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer, as the full YEI allocation of &euro;68m to Ireland will still be available for drawdown before year-end 2018, and it is expected that this funding will be fully drawn down.  Furthermore, as the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction in the funding available to those activities.<table><tr><th><b>Youth Employment Initiative</b></th><th><div><b>Funding (&euro;m)</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) Scheme</td><td><div>4.648</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus Incentive Scheme</td><td><div>7.992</div></td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td><div>35.347</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme</td><td><div>57.240</div></td></tr><tr><td>Youthreach</td><td><div>79.876</div></td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td><div>13.333</div></td></tr><tr><td>Social Inclusion and Activation Programme (SICAP)</td><td><div>6.000</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL</b></td><td><div><b>204.436</b></div></td></tr></table><table><tr><th><b>Youth Employment Initiative</b></th><th><div><b>Funding (&euro;m)</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) Scheme</td><td><div>4.648</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus Incentive Scheme</td><td><div>7.992</div></td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td><div>35.347</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme</td><td><div>57.240</div></td></tr><tr><td>Youthreach</td><td><div>79.876</div></td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td><div>13.333</div></td></tr><tr><td>Social Inclusion and Activation Programme (SICAP)</td><td><div>6.000</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL</b></td><td><div><b>204.436</b></div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

SOLAS have advised that in 2013, through an e-tender notification, it established a panel and managed the pre-qualification process for the provision of contracted training for the Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  This panel is due to expire in early 2017.  A new procurement framework for the delivery of the required service will be established by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) and operated by the ETBs for the purpose of delivering contracted training services.</p>  <p>  The OGP have posted a notice inviting the sector to provide feedback on the draft proposal for the operation of the framework.  All interested parties may submit their views.  I understand that the following approaches were included to ensure that small and medium sized businesses retain the opportunity to be listed on the new framework; </p>  <p>  Significant reduction in the turnover requirements regarding the financial capacity for applicants&bullet; Limiting the number of lots for which a larger company can apply.</p>  <p>  Limiting the minimum number of businesses that will be listed.</p>  <p>  Providing a viable sub-contracting option at tender stage and for specific technical contracts, to ensure that small businesses can avail of additional opportunities if they are not listed on the framework.</p>  <p>  Encouraging joint venture options by early notification of upcoming changes.</p>  <p>  I understand that while the market will ultimately determine the outcome of a regulated tender process, a maximum of 90 businesses can prequalify.  Each of these can nominate 3 sub-contractors at the tendering stage, which means that there could potentially be up to 270 businesses on the listing for contracted training at the end of the process.  There will be opportunities for small, medium and large indigenous training businesses within the new framework.  It should also be noted that there are currently 250 listed businesses on the current panel of which only a small percentage are actively responding to tender invitation opportunities.</p></reply>

In relation to rent stability, the Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period.  In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced. Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.</p><p>Further provisions to support rent stability in the 2015 Act include:</p><p>- that notice of new rent sent must be in a prescribed form, include details of dispute resolution procedures available through the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and be accompanied by details of rent in respect of 3 comparable dwellings in the area;</p><p>- that notification of a rent increase to the RTB will include, among other things, a signed statement by the tenant that they are aware of their rights in relation to rent and rent reviews.</p><p>With regard to the termination of a tenancy, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced strengthened protections applying to tenancy terminations in order to safeguard against terminations on false grounds.  These measures involve, inter alia, a landlord having to make a statutory declaration as to their intention to sell a property.  These provisions will be commenced on 9 May 2016.</p><p>Ultimately, a lack of supply and competition in the residential sector is putting upward pressure on rents and the key to addressing rising rents in the medium to long term is through increasing the supply of all forms of housing.  The Government is addressing this on a number of fronts, including through <i>Construction 2020; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector and the Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>.</p><p>In that regard, a number of important measures have been taken aimed at improving housing delivery viability and increasing supply, including the introduction of a vacant site levy; reductions in development contributions and a targeted development contribution rebate scheme in Dublin and Cork to encourage large scale developments at affordable prices; revised Part V provisions and legislative amendments to introduce greater flexibility and streamlining to the Strategic Development Zone provisions of the Planning and Development Acts.  The actions taken under <i>Construction 2020</i>are complemented by the ongoing implementation of the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>and the plans by NAMA to fund the delivery of 20,000 residential units by 2020.</p><p><i>Laying the Foundations: Housing Actions Report</i>, which was published on 14 April 2016, provides further information on thirty-one major actions taken across the housing spectrum since mid-2014 to increase the supply of housing.  The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at - </p><p>In recognition of the difficulty faced by households in accessing the housing market, an affordable rental pilot scheme was announced as part of Budget 2016, with &euro;10 million being made available to fund a pilot in 2016.  The details of the Scheme are currently being developed by my Department with a view to roll-out later this year.</p><p>The Scheme will involve an ongoing annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions.  The pilot Scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall.  It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed households on low to moderate incomes, as well as being a possible support option for some households who qualify for social housing support.  A State policy intervention - such as a subsidy - would be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford, and what the housing market charges. Such a scheme would also be expected to facilitate and incentivise private investment into this sector.</p><p>I am satisfied that an extensive range of housing measures have been undertaken within my powers as Minister and having regard to legal and financial constraints.  These measures are outlined in the aforementioned Housing Actions Report.  The residential construction sector in Ireland has undergone a very significant shock in recent years and housing output must be kept under review and further action taken as appropriate to ensure that supply returns to the levels required.</p></reply>

Following the necessary preparatory work the new Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.  The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible tenants must meet certain conditions including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the new Scheme the discounts are linked to tenant income and can be 40%, 50% or 60% of the purchase price.  On sale of a house under the Scheme, the housing authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount received.</p>  <p>  Where a tenant purchaser wishes to re-sell the house during the charge period he or she must seek the   consent of the housing authority to the resale.  In such cases, the housing authority also has the first option to buy back the house. If the tenant purchaser sells the house in the charge period, he or she must pay to the housing authority the current value of the outstanding charge.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provides for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale.  The Regulations do not exclude houses which have been specifically adapted for the needs of people with disabilities or houses which are affected by radon.</p>  <p>  Housing authorities may, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper estate management.  It is a matter for each housing authority to administer the new Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the relevant governing legislation.</p>  <p>  The new scheme is in the very early stages of implementation and my Department is monitoring its operation in consultation with housing authorities. </p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  I understand that Dublin City Council, as contracting authority for the rapid-delivery housing units intended to accommodate homeless families at Poppintree, Ballymun, availed of the accelerated restricted procedures under the relevant EU procurement directives for procurement of the units and that the Chief Executive availed of his powers under section 179(6)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 for planning purposes.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement is currently developing a Rapid Delivery Housing Procurement Framework, with a view to it being available by end-Summer.

The purpose of the Directive was to remind the authorities of the statutory provisions of section 179 of the Planning and Development Act and Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2011, as amended, in relation to local authority own development and recommend that they utilise all powers available to them under these provisions for the purpose of finding solutions to the social housing situation and accelerating the delivery of social housing developments to address the pressing social housing need.  </p></reply>

The properties under consideration are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired.  In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA. To the end of March 2016, 2,042 of these units have been secured for social housing providers.  This figure includes 1,469 units that are complete and a further 573 units where contracts have been signed and final completion works are under way in order to bring the units to a habitable standard.A further 163 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal is being carried out.  An additional 335 properties are to be further appraised.</p><p>While the allocation of properties to social housing tenants is a matter for each individual local authority, fromthe information available to my Department, I am confident that the majority of the 1,469 units that are complete are currently occupied.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in March 2016 projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in 2020 could be in the range of 6-11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis, Ireland will have a deficit of between 4 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2 e).  The projections suggest that Ireland may have a cumulative deficit of units in 2018 or 2019.  Some of this deficit can be addressed by means of the retirement of units carried forward from the 2008-2012 period, and some additional purchases may be required depending on the out-turn.Â  It is not possible to quantify these at present, having regard to both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.   </p>  <p>  A Member State demonstrating compliance with an annual target retires Annual Emissions Allocations (or units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexible Mechanisms) approximately 18 months after the year end, so it is unlikely that any expenditure required will occur before 2020 at the earliest. </p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. </p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government must submit a National Mitigation Plan to Government for approval by June 2017 at the latest.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.</p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this low carbon transition vision by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.</p></reply>

These distances may be reduced by the use of suitably located screen walls which can provide a barrier to the spread of fire.  These distance guidelines apply to caravans in temporary or permanent residential caravan parks for Travellers.  Also, the location of caravans should be such as to reduce the risk of fire between caravans and a building, or from a building to a caravan.</p><p>My Department initiated a Programme to Review Fire Safety in Traveller Accommodation in December 2015.

As such, the open fire place does not provide an optimum contribution to the high energy performance standard required of a modern, low energy dwelling.  Where regarded as desirable by homeowners, the open fire tends to be used only as a secondary source of heating and the dwelling concerned must also otherwise achieve the minimum energy performance standards as set out in Part L/TGD L 2011 which apply generally to all dwellings.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.Â  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  </p><p>There has been a longstanding provision for local authorities to seek community involvement in the improvement and maintenance work on suitable local roads and to facilitate this, local authorities are permitted to allocate a portion of their State grant funding to eligible schemes.</p><p>As indicated previously to the Deputy aÂ separate Community Involvement Scheme (CIS)Â pilot scheme did operate for two years inÂ 2013 and 2014.  Following its completion CIS reverted to the position where local authorities may set aside 7.5% of their RI and RM grants for CIS schemes if they so wish.Â  Applications under the scheme are made directly to the local authority and managed by it.</p><p>The Local Improvement Scheme also remains in place for 2016.Â  This Scheme provides funding for privateÂ roads and laneways, the maintenance and improvement of which is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.Â  While the LIS does not have a ring-fenced allocation, local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.Â </p><p>As the operation of both the CIS and LIS schemes are managed locally by the local authority, my Department does not have details of the schemes undertaken in local areas or the costs involved.Â  A table is provided showing the uptake for the pilot CIS operated by my Department in 2013 and 2014.</p><p>ThereÂ are no proposals at present to reintroduce a separate allocation for CIS or LIS.Â Â It is my view that each local authority isÂ best placed toÂ decide on allocations for these two schemes taking into account the own resource and grant funding available to it.  In this context I continue to emphasise to local authorities the importance of prioritising roads maintenanceÂ when allocating own resources.<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>2013 and 2014 Grant Expenditure</th><th>No. of Schemes</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>&euro;672,892</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td>&euro;1,521,399</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>&euro;953,339</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>&euro;1,829,886</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td>&euro;1,611,701</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>&euro;329,099</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>&euro;344,964</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>&euro;190,051</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>&euro;729,410</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>&euro;501,756</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>&euro;972,235</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>&euro;318,710</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td>&euro;154,065</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>&euro;1,428,481</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>&euro;909,474</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>&euro;1,651,383</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>&euro;804,682</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td>&euro;455,474</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>&euro;398,606</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary  Councils</td><td>&euro;1,428,638</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County Council</td><td>&euro;261,089</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td>&euro;492,640</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>&euro;1,284,142</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>&euro;219,000</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

There are many examples around the country of very positive collaboration between farmers, landowners, game shooters, field sports clubs, environmental NGOs and State agencies on the restoration of this species.</p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published a Species Action Plan for red grouse which charts the way forward for the conservation of the grouse.  The plan was produced as a collaborative exercise with the Irish Grey Partridge Conservation Trust, Countryside Alliance Ireland, the National Association of Regional Game Councils, the Irish Red Grouse Association, the Golden Eagle Trust, BirdWatch Ireland, the Irish Red &amp;amp; White Setter Association, the Irish Kennel Club, IFA Countryside and Cr&oacute; na mBraon&aacute;in Red Grouse sanctuary, and my Department is supporting ongoing meetings of the parties involved.</p>  <p>  My Department has also provided funding and logistical support to the Boleybrack and Ballydangan Bog red grouse projects and is directly involved in the management of habitat for grouse in National Parks and other lands in various parts of the country.  </p>  <p>  Key to the conservation of grouse is the restoration of degraded habitats.  Substantial improvements have been achieved in grazing management on hill commonages in the past 15 years and one benefit is the improvement in the conservation status of the species in areas such as the Nephin and Twelve Bens mountain ranges.</p>  <p>  My Department also carries out monitoring of the grouse.  This year there will be targeted red grouse surveys in counties Clare and Mayo to inform future habitat management measures and also to refine survey methodologies for future more broad scale surveys.</p></reply>
