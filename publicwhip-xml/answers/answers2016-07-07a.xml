    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-07a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070700071#WRA00500"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s towns and villages are the focus of the social, commercial and civic life of their wider communities.  Research conducted by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA) has, however, shown that rural towns have felt the impact of the economic challenges of recent years more acutely than cities and larger urban centres.  This significant deterioration of many small towns and villages throughout the country is clearly visible in the form of empty shops, abandoned buildings, vacant lands and a generally poor environment to live in or visit.  Targeted action is needed to arrest this decline and instead harness the regeneration potential of our towns and villages to support a now recovering economy.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a new scheme to support town and village regeneration is part of a concerted effort to support the development of rural towns and villages, not only as a component of a broader approach to rural development but also to improve the environment of rural dwellers in a way that will increase their quality of life and simultaneously enhance their potential to support potential economic activity in their area in the future.  </p>  <p>  I will shortly be launching the 2016 Town and Village Renewal scheme, which will be delivered by local authorities in conjunction with local communities and development organisations.  The type of projects to be funded under this initiative will primarily be a matter for the local authorities to identify in partnership with their communities.  However, the overall intention of the funding would be to focus on increasing the attractiveness of the town or village as a local commercial and social centre, enhancing its environment and tackling minor physical infrastructural deficits and land assembly issues.  The 2016 scheme will be strategically focused on the rural towns and villages that require assistance to stimulate new development and regeneration locally.  It will specifically target small towns and villages with populations of 5,000 or less. </p></reply>

I understand that many European counties are not included in the figures, including ten EU member states.  The data for the Compendium project are provided by independent researchers and it is not a standardised system for collection of statistics.</p><p>I further understand that Compendium itself warns that data provided by the researchers are not comparable across countries because each researcher includes different elements in the definition of culture and these elements are reflected in the figures for public expenditure.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, artists, exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are all examples of elements not included in the Council of Europe figures for Ireland but included in the figures for some other countries.</p><p><b></b>Expenditure on the arts in Ireland comes from multiple sources, both public and private.  I understand that the CSO does not produce national statistics that capture the totality of this expenditure as a percentage of GDP.</p><p>The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is one that was discussed in the public consultation process held for the purpose of developing Ireland's first national Cultural Policy Framework, <i>Culture 2025</i>.  As I have previously stated, I do consider that further research on this issue is warranted in the context of <i>Culture 2025</i>.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>commits to the publication of <i>Culture 2025</i>as a priority.  My Department is continuing to consider inputs on the draft document from the Steering and Expert Groups, which I established, and I expect to forward a draft for consideration to the relevant Oireachtas Committee shortly.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through measures to incentivise and accelerate industry investment, and an ambitious investment programme by the State, in areas where industry will not invest.</p><p>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources&rsquo;s Department is responsible for advancing the procurement process to select a winning bidder or bidders for the contract, which will comprise one or two lots, as set out in the national broadband plan intervention strategy.  It is expected that a contract or contracts will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the rural broadband network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, I will establish a number of local/regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies.  The taskforces will help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, by ensuring that there are no local barriers to deployment and by identifying priority areas for rollout.  To this end, they will also develop Rural Digital Strategies, which will include proposals for regional digital hubs.</p><p>I will also meet with each Local Authority Chief Executive over the coming period to reinforce the importance of the rollout of broadband.  I will be asking them to prioritise actions to overcome any possible barriers and to ensure there will be no unnecessary delays to the rollout of this vital infrastructure to rural communities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-07a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070700071#WRA01200"><p>Waterways Ireland has been actively progressing the development of Blueways as a means to attract new visitors to use the waterways and in response to the growth in demand for recreational activities such as walking, canoeing, cycling and stand up paddle boarding.</p><p>The first Blueway was launched in October 2014 on the Shannon and it has been very successful.  It links Drumshanbo with Carrick-on-Shannon and comprises a 16.5km paddling trail, a 10km walking trail and a 5km cycle trail.  The 10km Camlin River paddling loop is also in operation.  </p><p>The Shannon-Erne Blueway, which I had the privilege of officially opening on 28 May 2016, links Leitrim Village with Belturbet, Co Cavan and provides a 70km series of paddling journeys, 25kms of walking trails and 8kms of cycling trails.  There are also plans to upgrade a further 8kms this year.  Based on existing monitoring of visitor usage, Waterways Ireland expects that 100,000 people will use the Shannon-Erne Blueway over the next year.</p><p>Further development on the Shannon which is planned for 2016 includes:</p><p>- A 20km trail from Carrick-on-Shannon to Boyle;</p><p>- A 50km trail from Carrick-on-Shannon to Lanesborough, and </p><p>- A 30km looped trail around Lough Allen.</p><p>On the Royal Canal and Grand Canals, 45kms and 21kms of towpath trails have been developed respectively.  Plans for upgrading the remaining towpaths on these canals are at varying stages and Waterways Ireland is working with various stakeholders, including the local authorities, LEADER groups, the National Transport Authority and the National Trails Office, to progress these developments. </p><p>On the Barrow Navigation, Waterways Ireland plans to submit proposals to upgrade the Barrow towpath to the relevant planning authorities shortly.  This will enhance the 112kms of off-road trackway from Lowtown in Co. Kildare to St Mullins in Co Carlow.</p><p>Clearly, the development of Blueways presents valuable opportunities for rural communities to attract more visitors.  Their value lies not only in the recreational opportunities that they offer but also in their potential to stimulate local businesses and regenerate local areas.  Blueways also provide an effective model for partnership between the private, community and voluntary sectors and relevant State bodies.  </p><p>I am strongly of the view that the new configuration of my Department will offer significant opportunities for enhanced partnership on these matters and I look forward to working with my colleague, Minister of State Michael Ring, to that end.</p></reply>

It also includes the creation of an exhibition and interpretive space and will be a great amenity for the public and the local community as a modern heritage site.  The project is managed by Dublin City Council via two structures - the Dublin City Council Steering Group and the Richmond Barracks Advisory Committee.</p><p>The project was completed on schedule and the new centre was officially launched on 2 May 2016 by the Lord Mayor of Dublin to coincide with the centenary of the first court martial of the 1916 Rising leaders.</p><p>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to his Question No 59 of 1 June 2016, Dublin City Council will be responsible for the day to day management of the building.  However, I understand that the facility is now open to the public and will also be available for various events, including small-scale conferences.  There are scheduled tours each day, with all information being made available at <i>www.richmondbarracks.ie</i>.</p><p>Richmond Barracks is a new tourism product.  Focussed and targeted marketing will be key to raise awareness of the facility to ensure that it generates appropriate footfall.  The Ireland 2016 Project Office within my Department will continue to work closely with colleagues in Dublin City Council and the OPW to ensure maximum publicity for this initiative.</p></reply>

The legislation required to allow for these pilot measures was included in the Heritage Bill 2016, which was published in January 2016 and subsequently completed Second Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  Steps are in hand to reintroduce the Heritage Bill into Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the earliest opportunity.

These include significant elements of temporary support works, underpinning of existing structures to maintain temporary stability, uneven walking surfaces, awkward access and layout and restricted circulation within the site.  There are also legal obligations with regard to responsibility for the safety of any and all persons who may enter on to it.  </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, access will generally have to remain limited to construction personnel until such time as it is confirmed that the site may be opened to other visitors.</p></reply>

The data for the Compendium project are provided by independent researchers and it is not a standardised system for collection of statistics.</p><p>I further understand that Compendium itself warns that data provided by the researchers are not comparable across countries because each researcher includes different elements in the definition of culture and these elements are reflected in the figures for public expenditure.

Much of this investment is also of huge interest and benefit to young people, for example, investment in museums and cultural centres, in creative activity as funded through the Arts Council and through Irish film.</p><p>The<i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>recalls how our arts and culture were highlighted during the successful 1916 Commemorations, and how they were seen to be intrinsic to the Irish State itself.  Those elements of the <i>Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme</i>which focused on schools and young people were particularly successful in capturing the imagination.</p><p>On the international stage, my Department through Culture Ireland supports Irish artists to present their work worldwide.  This serves to raise the global awareness of the strong reputation of the Irish arts sector, develop new audiences abroad for Irish artists and highlight Ireland as a country with a strong creative sector. </p><p>Culture Ireland supported Irish artists in over 300 events in 2015, winning high profile awards and critical recognition and seen by a live audience of approximately 3 million audience members with a further 6.5m million online/radio/television viewers.  It is expected a similar number of events will be supported in 2016, in addition to a further 130 events funded under the &lsquo;I Am Ireland&rsquo; programme.  A special focus around St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, a key period for raising the profile of Ireland globally, saw over 80 events in 16 countries supported in 2016..</p><p>My Department, together with the Arts Council and Heritage Council, also continues to support local events and festivals throughout Ireland, all of which contribute to promoting our national image.</p><p>In relation to young people, the Arts in Education Charter has been a landmark development in relation to the promotion of arts education and arts in education in Ireland.  The Charter is an initiative of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills, working in association with the Arts Council.  My Department is involved in ongoing liaison with the Department of Education and Skills on the implementation of the Arts in Education Charter objectives.  The<i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>also recognises the Charter as providing an unprecedented opportunity for children and young people to engage in a proactive and meaningful way with arts in education in Ireland and commits to its implementation.</p><p>All of these initiatives are important in promoting our national image, both at home and abroad, and in generating increased interest in cultural matters among our young people.</p></reply>

Easter Monday saw the largest public history and cultural event ever staged in Ireland, with more than 500 free talks, exhibitions, music, theatre, debates and performances across a number of venues and zones in Dublin City Centre.  Official estimates indicate that over 1 million people were present to participate in and enjoy these two events alone.</p>  <p>  Feedback from members of the public and the media clearly indicated the very positive engagement of citizens with the commemorative events, as well as the extent to which they felt a great sense of national pride and respect during this historic time.  </p>  <p>  The Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme is a year-long initiative, with a huge diversity of programmes and events running throughout 2016.  While a large number of the key events took place around the Easter period, the Programme will continue through the remainder of 2016 and there are many exciting and innovative programmes and initiatives planned, including a large number of activities at local level.

This flexibility allows space to adapt to the demanding schedules faced by the President and An Taoiseach with a view to their leading the official representation at the annual National Famine Commemoration ceremony whenever possible, and also to allow for any particular circumstances that may arise from time to time around the arrangements. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the retention of flexibility in relation to the date of the commemoration does not detract from its key aim, which is to have a fitting national ceremony to remember and show respect for all those who died or suffered loss during the Great Famine.  In fact, this flexibility facilitates the commemoration being held in the most appropriate context each year, maximising the quality of the programme and the levels of public attention it receives.

Its aim is to help filmmakers to make Irish films, and provide production and development loans for features, television programmes, animation projects, documentaries and short films.  The Board supports and promotes the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  The Film Board also liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland in terms of maximising joint opportunities for promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions.  Examples of this could be seen during Ireland&rsquo;s success at the Oscars this year and the promotional activity around the shooting of Star Wars in Ireland.</p><p>Film making in Ireland is also supported by the Section 481 film tax credit system, which incentivises film investment in Ireland. This incentive was enhanced in Budget 2016, when the cap for eligible expenditure on film projects was increased from &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million.</p><p>Clearly, funding across the public service was severely impacted by the economic crisis, including the funding that could be provided for investment in culture and the arts.  Since my initial appointment as Minister with responsibility for the arts, I have succeeded in securing increased funding for the sector year on year.  The allocation to the Irish Film Board in 2016 at almost &euro;14.5 million shows an increase of 3.6% from last year.  I am pleased that I have already been able to provide some additional support to the Film Board this year, with additional current funding of &euro;500,000.  This increased investment will help to maximise the benefits brought about by the enhancement of the Section 481 film tax credit system to which I have referred.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains an ambitious agenda of priorities in relation to achieving a stable, sustainable and secure funding model for the arts in line with improvements in the economy and the public finances.  The Programme also contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes.</p></reply>

The post office network plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike.  However, the postal sector is undergoing significant change, with migration towards electronic communications resulting in core mail volume decline year on year.</p><p>In recognition of the changing commercial environment, the previous Government established the Post Office Network Business Development Group, the remit of which was to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network.  Mr Bobby Kerr was appointed as the independent chairman of the group and he brought a depth of knowledge and experience in identifying and developing business opportunities for the post office network.</p><p>The final report of the group, which was published in January of this year, details 23 recommendations - with network renewal, a basic payment account and motor tax being the three key actions.  The final report recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>A number of working groups have also been established, including a network renewal implementation group, which is being independently chaired by Mr Bobby Kerr.  This group is examining the number and spatial distribution of branches, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts and training and qualifications for post office employees.  An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, are members of the group, which is of fundamental importance to the long-term future of the network.  While good progress has been made to date, the group&rsquo;s work remains on-going.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations of the final report, including supporting the implementation of a basic payment account and enabling the payment of motor tax through the post office network.  Responsibility for implementation of the recommendations in the final report has recently transferred to my Department, along with a number of staff with expertise on the matter. </p><p>I recently met with Mr Kerr with a view to finalising a timeframe for the conclusion of the work of the network renewal implementation group and the implementation of the recommendations, which will refresh, renew and reinvent the Post Office Network and ensure its sustainability into the future.</p></reply>

This serves to raise the global awareness of the strong reputation of the Irish arts sector, generate new career opportunities for Irish artists and develop new audiences abroad for Irish artists.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the Global Irish Network which has to date made many significant achievements in relation to highlighting Ireland's creativity on the world stage.  I consider that this is the most appropriate vehicle in which to highlight the achievement of Irish creativity &ndash; as part of a wider cross sectoral partnership.  Most notable in terms of this collaborative approach have been <i>Irish Design 2015</i>, with which my Department had a significant engagement in relation to the international programme, and the <i>Imagine Ireland</i>programme in 2011.</p><p><i>Imagine Ireland</i>, launched following the strategic focus on culture at the first Global Forum in 2009, was a special year-long initiative by Culture Ireland, showcasing Irish arts and culture in the US throughout 2011.

This programme reflects that interest in Irish artistic excellence continues to grow internationally and recognises that this centenary year offers a unique opportunity to build on Ireland's cultural connections and share the talents of Irish artists through many special and diverse events around the world. </p><p>I am satisfied that following the success of these initiatives that a global forum for the arts is best achieved through the broad based Global Irish Network.</p></reply>

These figures do not include visitors or related spend in the economy by domestic visitors engaging in hiking or walking.  </p><p>These statistics demonstrate that hiking and walking on all trails, not just those covered by the Walks Scheme, are contributing to the Irish economy in attracting overseas visitors.

I understand that many European counties are not included in the figures, including ten EU member states.  The data for the Compendium project are provided by independent researchers and it is not a standardised system for collection of statistics.</p><p>I further understand that Compendium itself warns that data provided by the researchers are not comparable across countries because each researcher includes different elements in the definition of culture and these elements are reflected in the figures for public expenditure.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, artists, exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are all examples of elements not included in the Council of Europe figures for Ireland but included in the figures for some other countries.</p><p>Expenditure on the arts in Ireland comes from multiple sources, both public and private.  I understand that the CSO does not produce national statistics that capture the totality of this expenditure as a percentage of GDP.</p><p>The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is one that was discussed in the public consultation process held for the purpose of developing Ireland's first national Cultural Policy Framework, <i>Culture 2025</i>.  As I have previously stated, I do consider that further research on this issue is warranted in the context of <i>Culture 2025</i>.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>commits to the publication of <i>Culture 2025</i>as a priority.  My Department is continuing to consider inputs on the draft document from the Steering and Expert Groups, which I established, and I expect to forward a draft for consideration to the relevant Oireachtas Committee shortly.</p></reply>

Cavan, tomorrow morning.  My Department has issued funding agreements to local action groups in 21 of the 28 sub-regional areas designated under the LEADER programme and I expect that most, if not all, of these local action groups will be in a position to finalise their respective agreements at this event.</p>  <p>  The delivery of LEADER will commence immediately in these areas and the local action groups can begin receiving applications starting from Monday morning.  I am aware that a large amount of work has been on-going behind the scenes in each area since the closure of the old LEADER programme, aided with funding from my Department, and I expect that these groups should be able to hit the ground running in terms of receiving and approving applications.</p>  <p>  I am also confident that Funding Agreements will issue in the remaining 7 LEADER sub-regional areas in the coming weeks as the local action groups provide the additional information and clarifications requested by the Independent Selection Committee established to review and select the strategies submitted in each area.  Indeed, the Independent Selection Committee is meeting today to review progress and will meet again in early August to facilitate the finalisation of strategies.</p>  <p>  There is also the possibility of an appeal in two of the competitive areas where more than one strategy was submitted and that process must be allowed to run its course before a Funding Agreement can issue.  I can assure the Deputy that funding agreements will issue in all of these remaining areas as a matter of urgency, once all of the outstanding issues have been resolved.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am pleased to note that LEADER funding can now begin to flow to communities throughout Ireland and I look forward to providing funding to the many fine LEADER projects that will undoubtedly emerge in the coming months and years.</p></reply>

In this regard, I am pleased that the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to the continued implementation of the <i>Arts in Education Charter</i>.</p><p>The work of the two Departments and the Arts Council in implementing the Charter is achieved largely through existing structures, such as education centres and Education and Training Boards.  My Department provides a small amount of funding under the Charter to assist with its implementation, for example, in relation to the funding of artists to assist in the Teacher Artist Partnership Initiative.  In 2015, the Arts in Education Portal was launched and this now serves as an effective key communications and information channel for both education and arts sectors.</p><p>As recently as last April, a very successful inaugural National Arts in Education Day was held in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, with over 200 attendees from both education and artistic fields.</p><p>In terms of direct support for the arts, this is primarily a matter for the Arts Council operating under the provisions of the Arts Act 2003.

This consensus approach is underpinned by the principle of mutual respect between landowners and recreation users, with the acceptance of the rights of landowners regarding access to their land and the need of recreation users to have reasonable access to the countryside.</p><p>Unless a public right of way exists, access to any land in private ownership is at the discretion of the landowner and the extent to which access by members of the public to that land is permitted is within the control of the landowner.</p><p>Currently, my Department administers the Walks Scheme, which is a maintenance-based scheme whereby participating landholders receive modest payments to maintain sections of National Way Marked Ways and other priority walks that traverse their lands.  The number of participants on the Scheme currently stands at 1,908 with a total of 39 trails covered by the Scheme.  Payments to participants on the Scheme will be in the region of &euro;1.8m in 2016.</p><p>There is a commitment in<i>A Programme for a Partnership Government</i>to expand the Walks Scheme and I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes.  I am convinced that such an expansion would boost the number of high quality walks available to citizens and visitors alike, thereby increasing the attractiveness of the walking experiences available throughout Ireland.</p><p>The National Trails Office of Sport Ireland has responsibility for trail standards and for trail inspections.  These inspections are carried out by inspectors and a detailed report compiled.  Once a recreational trail has been inspected and approved, it becomes accredited and can be listed on the Irish Trails Register, www.irishtraile.ie, which is maintained by the National Trails Office.  There are currently 886 trails listed.</p><p>An insurance policy is held by the National Trails Office, which indemnifies all landowners and occupiers whose property or land is crossed or adjoins a &lsquo;recreational trail&rsquo;, once that trail has been inspected and approved by the National Trails Office.  The cover extends to liability attaching to the land or property owner arising from a user of the &lsquo;recreational trail&rsquo; sustaining accidental bodily injury or property damage when on the land of the owner for recreational or leisure activities connected with the designated &lsquo;recreational trail&rsquo;.</p><p>The Occupiers Liability Act 1995 already provides significant protection to landowners, but the upfront costs of successfully defending a claim can be significant.  My Department is currently considering the introduction of a National Indemnity Scheme which would indemnify private landowners against claims from recreational users for injury or damage to property.  Discussions are at an advanced stage and I am hopeful that a scheme can be agreed in a number of pilot areas before the end of 2016.</p></reply>

Its aim is to help filmmakers to make Irish films, and provide production and development loans for features, television programmes, animation projects, documentaries and short films.  The Board supports and promotes the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  The Film Board also liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland in terms of maximising joint opportunities for promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions.  Examples of this could be seen during Ireland&rsquo;s success at the Oscars this year and the promotional activity around the shooting of Star Wars in Ireland.</p><p>Film making in Ireland is also supported by the Section 481 film tax credit system, which incentivises film investment in Ireland.  This incentive was enhanced in Budget 2016, when the cap for eligible expenditure on film projects was increased from &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million.</p><p>Clearly, funding across the public service was severely impacted by the economic crisis, including the funding that could be provided for investment in culture and the arts.  Since my initial appointment as Minister with responsibility for the arts, I have succeeded in securing increased funding for the sector year on year.  The allocation to the Irish Film Board in 2016 at almost &euro;14.5 million shows an increase of 3.6% from last year.  I am pleased that I have already been able to provide some additional support to the Film Board this year, with additional current funding of &euro;500,000.  This increased investment will help to maximise the benefits brought about by the enhancement of the Section 481 film tax credit system to which I have referred.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains an ambitious agenda of priorities in relation to achieving a stable, sustainable and secure funding model for the arts in line with improvements in the economy and the public finances.  The Programme also contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes.</p></reply>

This scheme is operating in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support in excess of 330 projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is now fully allocated.</p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, which has an allocation of over &euro;900,000 and will support 57 projects nationally in 2016, is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Funding for 2016 has now been fully allocated.</p><p>No decision has been made on the allocation of funding to these schemes for 2017, which will be subject to the normal budgetary processes. The Conservation or Heritage Officer in the relevant local authority will be able to advise regarding funding available for conservation works to structures on the Record of Protected Structures and it is advisable for interested parties to remain in contact with their local authority on an ongoing basis.</p><p>My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2016 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  OPW undertakes the care and maintenance of national monuments in my ownership or guardianship (of which there are approximately 750).  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  The Council recently awarded funding of over &euro;880,000 to 171 heritage projects nationwide under its 2016 Heritage Management Grant Scheme.

However, the Arts Council is aware of the issues regarding geographical and demographic access and in this regard the Arts Council Strategy (2016&ndash;2025), <i>Making Great Art Work</i>, sets out how it will lead the development of the arts in Ireland over the next decade.  This contains five priority areas as follows:- the Artist; Public Engagement; Investment Strategy; Spatial and Demographic Planning and Developing Capacity.</p><p>Information on the Arts Council's funding schemes, funding decisions and reasons for those decisions is available for each county through its decisions database on its website.</p><p>My Department has a role in providing capital funding for Arts and Cultural centres.  In this regard, I announced a new &euro;9 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres to run over the next three years, focussed on enhancing the existing stock of such centres around the country.  My Department is finalising the guidelines and application forms in relation to the scheme, which I intend to open for applications shortly.

Anyone proposing works to a monument that is included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start.</p>  <p>  I also have a role, as Minister, in terms of being a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015, whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by a planning authority to my Department so that recommendations can be made as appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.</p>  <p>  My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of major historical or cultural sites.  As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.</p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2016 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  OPW undertakes the care and maintenance of national monuments in my ownership or guardianship (of which there are approximately 750).  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.</p>  <p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  Under Section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its record of protected structures, a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure.  Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the record of protected structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it.  Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development.  There is a duty of owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.  Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.</p>  <p>  There is a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites/buildings deemed to be at risk.  One of these is the receipt of applications for funding for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.  Financial support is being provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.</p>  <p>  I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support in excess of 330 projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is now fully allocated.</p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, which has an allocation of over &euro;900,000 and will support 57 projects nationally in 2016, is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Funding for 2016 has now been fully allocated.</p></reply>

On the contrary, a larger Department with wider responsibilities, will bring greater weight to bear in promoting the importance of arts and culture right across Government.  The wider brief of rural and regional affairs sits well with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>to strengthen the role of arts and heritage at local level, including by building stronger links with local development groups.</p><p>This is also coupled with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>to progressively increase funding to the arts as the economy continues to improve.  In 2016, the Arts, Culture and Film programme of my Department will account for the highest proportion of my Department&rsquo;s Vote at 49% (&euro;188m) of the total allocation.  This reflects the fact that the arts are essential to the well-being of our society and that a thriving arts and cultural sector makes a hugely positive contribution to the Irish nation in general.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed that there are 15 dedicated Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the Wicklow Garda Division.  The distribution of Garda&iacute; and Community Garda&iacute; throughout the Division on the 31 May 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is set out in the following table.</p><p>Of course, it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland - Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme <font color="#2F2F2F">to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.  Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the  accelerated Garda recruitment programme.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  I welcome in particular the proposal to establish local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to work with the community to prevent and detect crime.  The CPTs will take proactive measures to prevent crime from happening in the area.  This will entail a combination of crime prevention advice, targeting and disrupting criminals through operations and patrols, and where possible diverting people from committing crime.  I also welcome the proposal to establish Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.  The implementation of these initiatives has started  and will be rolled out nationwide.</p><p><b>WICKLOW GARDA DIVISION 31 May 2016</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT</th><th>STATION</th><th>Comm Garda&iacute;</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALTINGLASS</td><td>1</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLESSINGTON</td><td>1</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARNEW</td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNLAVIN</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHILLELAGH</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>BALTINGLASS</td><td>TINAHELY</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>BALTINGLASS  Total </td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRAY</td><td>7</td><td>116</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENNISKERRY</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GREYSTONES</td><td>2</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>BRAY  </td><td>NEWTOWNMOUNTKENNEDY</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>BRAY  Total </td><td>148</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ARKLOW</td><td>4</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ASHFORD</td><td></td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AUGHRIM</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AVOCA</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHDRUM</td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROUNDWOOD</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW </td><td>WICKLOW</td><td></td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Wicklow   Total   15</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>WICKLOW DIVISION TOTAL</td><td>309</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Following an examination of the case referred to in the Deputy's question by one of the counsel appointed to the Independent Review Mechanism, I received a recommendation of the outcome of that review.  A letter setting out the outcome and recommendation was issued to the complainant last December.  The recommendation made by counsel was that I should take no further action in this case.  I should mention, however, that my predecessor referred aspects of this particular case to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and I understand that investigation has not concluded. </p>  <p>  It is important that a number of facts are clearly understood in relation to the Independent Review Mechanism.</p>  <p>  Firstly, counsel were independent and it was open to them to make any recommendation that they saw fit.  Furthermore, I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation and it was not designed to make findings.  Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.  In the present case their recommendation was that no further action should be taken.</p>  <p>  It is also important that I emphasise, yet again, that appropriate steps were taken to ensure that nothing arose which might in any way have detracted from the integrity of the review mechanism, including issues of conflict of interest.  Arrangements were put in place  to ensure that if there was any conflict, or potential conflict, the conflicted counsel not only was not involved in the particular complaint, but also was not aware of which counsel was reviewing it.  This is normal professional conduct and there were sufficient counsel on the Panel to ensure the practicality of this.  Whatever steps were necessary in this regard were taken to ensure there was no conflict of interest.</p>  <p>  I should also mention that a civil action has been initiated against the State in respect of issues raised in the complaint.  In the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on any particulars of this matter.</p></reply>

In general, detention is used sparingly in relation to immigration related matters.  Where possible, persons are served with a notice under section 14 of the Immigration Act 2004 which provides for the issue of a written instruction setting out reporting and residence conditions to a non-national who does not have permission to be in the State.  This is used in certain low risk cases as an alternative to detention prior to return.  Persons held on immigration related matters, including those with deportation orders are, unless the subject of a conviction, in general kept apart from convicted persons while in detention and are treated the same as remand prisoners and are subject to the same regime and receive the same privileges as this grouping. </p>  <p>  Section 78 of the International Protection Act 2015 inserts a new section 5 into the Immigration Act 1999 which includes a provision  permitting a person to be detained for up to 12 hours in facilities at the port from which he or she is to be returned, thus further reducing the need for detention in a prison or Garda station. </p>  <p>  Plans are being progressed for the provision of a dedicated immigration detention facility at Dublin Airport.  I am informed that plans for the facility have been drawn up and agreement reached with the Office of Public Works and the Dublin Airport Authority for the necessary redevelopment work to be carried out.  This redevelopment will be completed as soon as possible within the next 12 months and will replace the existing Garda Station at the airport, provide office accommodation for Garda&iacute; and civilians as well as providing a modern detention facility.</p></reply>

As set out in my response to the Deputy on 28 June, a range of actions have been taken by INIS to address the difficulties that have arisen in this area due to the unprecedented increase in applications since 2014, including the allocation of additional resources and ongoing overtime.  Arising from this strategy, over 3,000 applications have been processed  in the first six months of this year.  This represents a 45% increase on the number of applications processed over the same period in 2015.  However, with such an unprecedented growth in applications it is inevitable that there will be significant pressures and processing times will be impacted. </p>  <p>  I would also remind the Deputy that INIS has serious concerns that a significant number of applications are indicative of potential abuse of the Common Travel Area (CTA).  In that regard, the process demands detailed robust investigation and fair procedures.  While INIS is committed to processing applications with the objective of achieving the highest possible level of efficiency for applicants, this must be balanced with safeguarding the integrity of the operation of the CTA and the State's immigration system.</p></reply>

An action programme will be announced in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the proposal for a moratorium on house repossessions was included in the range of recommendations in a recent Report of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The recommendation was that, subject to the advice of the Attorney General, the Government should introduce legislation for a moratorium on home repossessions until such time as the Government&rsquo;s proposals in relation to housing and homelessness are in place.  I can confirm that this recommendation, together with the Committee's other recommendations, is being considered by the Government in the context of the formulation of its action plan. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware from my response to question 28 of 22 June that  the Government is already preparing a range of measures to support people in mortgage arrears.  In particular, intensive work has been done on preparing a new scheme to provide distressed homeowners with access to independent legal and financial aid and advice to help resolve their mortgage arrears.  Intensive work on implementing this Aid and Advice Scheme has been under way across Government Departments and other relevant bodies.  This work has been led by my Department and by the Department of Social Protection, with the participation of the Insolvency Service Ireland, the Legal Aid Board, the Citizens&rsquo; Information Board and the Money and Budgeting Service (MABS).  It builds on a network of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears Advisers established in MABS offices across the country which was announced in December 2015. </p>  <p>  MABS will act as a single gateway to the new Scheme for those who are deep in debt and at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears.  MABS advisers will advise these borrowers on options for returning to solvency and remaining in their homes as far as possible.  This may involve obtaining financial advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner or accountant and legal aid and advice from a solicitor.  The Scheme will also provide for support for insolvent borrowers in repossession proceedings under a new &lsquo;duty solicitor&rsquo; service operated by the Legal Aid Board. Work on implementation is almost complete and I expect the Scheme to become operational in the near future.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed that there are 351 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Tipperary Garda Division.  The distribution of Garda&iacute; throughout the Division on the 31 May 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is set out in the following table.  I have requested the Commissioner to indicate if any of these members are work sharing and I will write to the Deputy when this information is to hand.</p><p>I have also been informed that there are 20 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na eligible to retire in the Tipperary Division in 2016 as at 5 July.  It is important to note that the number of Garda&iacute; eligible for retirement is not an indicator of the number of Garda&iacute; who will actually retire in a particular year.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined the organisation prior to 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension once they have served for at least 30 years and they have reached 50 years of age.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined the organisation on or after 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension once they have served at least 30 years and have reached 55 years of age.  All Garda&iacute; must retire when they reach 60 years of age.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 300 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.  Of these, 16 newly attested members have been assigned to the Tipperary Garda Division.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that projected departures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are kept under continuing review and the level of recruitment adjusted as necessary in order to achieve the desired strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na<b><font color="#000080">. </font></b>I am advised, based on a thorough analysis of the data, that the Garda authorities project retirements overall this year to be around the 300 mark with similar projections for the coming years.  Taking account of the projected retirements for this year and the number of new recruits who will attest I expect Garda numbers to reach the 13,000 mark by the end of this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p><p><b>Tipperary Garda Division 31 May 2016</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT</th><th>STATION</th><th>Gda</th><th>Sgt</th><th>Insp</th><th>Supt</th><th>C/Supt.</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>ARDFINNAN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYPOREEN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAHIR</td><td>41</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASHEL</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>CAHIR </td><td>CLOGHEEN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAHIR                   Total</td><td>54</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRICK-ON-SUIR</td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONMEL</td><td>40</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FETHARD</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILSHEELAN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CLONMEL </td><td>MULLINAHONE</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONMEL Total </td><td>57</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BORRISOKANE</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOUGHJORDAN </td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LORRHA</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONEYGALL</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NENAGH</td><td>32</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWPORT</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PORTROE</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROSCREA</td><td>15</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>NENAGH </td><td>TOOMEVARA</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NENAGH                  Total</td><td>64</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINGARRY SOUTH</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BORRISOLEIGH</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLENAULE</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TEMPLEMORE</td><td>21</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TEMPLETUOHY</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>THURLES</td><td>THURLES</td><td>61</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>THURLES Total </td><td>88</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAPPAWHITE</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GOLDEN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY </td><td>TIPPERARY TOWN</td><td>29</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TIPPERARY Total </td><td>31</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tipperary Division Total </td><td>294</td><td>47</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>351</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Charities Regulatory Authority (also known as the Charities Regulator) was established as an independent agency on 16 October 2014 and is responsible for the registration and regulation of all the charities active in this country.  The key areas of work of the Regulator include registration and award of charitable status, annual reporting, compliance and investigations, charity services and providing a public register and statistical information on the charity sector.</p>  <p>  When the Charities Regulatory Authority was established in October 2014, there were ten staff working in this area.  This has since been increased to 23 members of staff and the budget for 2016 provides for this to increase further to 36. I am determined to make sure that the Authority has the necessary staff and financial resources available to achieve its goals.  The Charities Regulator was allocated a significant increase in its pay budget for 2016 to allow for the full complement of staff required to ensure that the full range of provisions contained in the Charities Act 2009 could be commenced as soon as possible.  A budget of &euro;2.665 million has been allocated to the Regulator for 2016, compared to a budget of &euro;1.419 million for 2015, an increase of 88%.  This increased funding is facilitating recruitment of additional staff in key areas including policy development, registration and reporting, compliance and investigations and communications.  My Department, together with the Public Appointments Service, is working to put in place the full complement of staff and I expect these staff to be in place in the coming weeks and months.</p></reply>

This ensures firms have the ability to pay all policyholders' claims without recourse to public or consumer funds.  The Central Bank does not have a statutory role in relation to setting premium prices.  </p>  <p>  In its Macro-Financial Review for the first half of 2016 which was published on 14th June and is available on the Central Bank of Ireland's website www.centralbank.ie, the Central Bank highlights a number of issues facing the non-life insurance sector.  These include the impact of the low interest rate environment that has resulted in a fall in investment income which historically was used to offset underwriting losses.  The Central Bank believes that investment income will continue to decline as proceeds from maturing assets are reinvested in lower yielding assets.  The Report concludes that the domestic non-life insurance sector continues to face a difficult operating environment with all of the high-impact firms reporting underwriting losses in 2015 primarily due to current challenges in the Irish motor market.  It also notes that the risk-sensitive regulatory framework, Solvency II, which came into effect on 1 January 2016, should strengthen insurers' resilience.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that the decline in returns on investments through low interest rates has been a key theme in its engagement with the insurance industry for a number of years and forms a key part of its supervisory engagement with individual firms.  The Opinion on Supervisory Response to a Prolonged Low Interest Rate Environment published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in February 2013 required all National Competent Authorities to intensify the monitoring and supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings with exposure to the risks posed by a low interest rate environment.</p>  <p>  To examine the issues affecting the cost of insurance in more detail and to assess what the options are for the Government, I have established a task force in my Department to undertake a Review of Policy in the Insurance Sector.  This Task Force will be chaired by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy.  The work of the task force includes an examination of the issues debated during the D&aacute;il Private Member's Motion of the 8th and 9th of June 2016.  The work is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, other Government Departments, Agencies and interested bodies.  The aim of this work is to identify the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance, and to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector in Ireland, identifying the issues that can be addressed on a more immediate basis and those that need more long-term policy implementation.</p>  <p>  This work will be completed over the coming months.</p></reply>

Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>- Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>- Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>Transfers and inheritance between spouses are not subject to CAT.</p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.</p><p>As with all tax areas capital acquisitions tax (CAT), including issues such rates of tax, tax-free thresholds, reliefs and exemptions, is kept under review.  As part of Budget 2016 I raised the Group A tax-free threshold applying to gifts and inheritance from parents to their children from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000.  This represented an increase of about 25%.  I did this in recognition of the improving state of the public finances and of the concerns expressed to me by people making and receiving gifts and inheritances, particularly in a context of rising property prices.</p><p>I indicated at the time that I saw the change to the Group A tax- free threshold in the last Budget as the start of a process.  The extent to which increases in the various tax-free thresholds for CAT purposes, can be accommodated in the future will depend, among other things, on the continuing economic recovery and the competing choices for limited resources.  The Deputy will be aware of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to work with the Oireachtas to raise the Group A CAT tax-free threshold (including all gifts and inheritances from parents to their children) to &euro;500,000.</p></reply>

This announcement is not surprising given that the UK had previously announced a cut to 17% by 2020.  There appears to be no timeframe set for this further reduction and we will have to wait and see the details when they emerge, for example whether the rate cut is to be paid for by compensating base broadening measures.  My Department will of course examine any such proposals when the details are available.</p>  <p>  At 12.5%, Ireland has one of the most competitive and stable headline corporate tax rates in the OECD.  I believe that Ireland's long-term commitment to the 12.5% rate ensures that we remain highly competitive and supports Ireland's ability to attract and retain investment from around the world.  Our competitive rate of corporation tax has been an important part of our industrial policy since the 1950s, and has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland since then.</p>  <p>  In a recent research paper, commissioned by the Department of Finance as part of a Joint Research Programme with the ESRI, entitled "Corporate Taxation and Foreign Direct Investment in EU Countries: Policy Implications for Ireland", the Economic and Social Research Institute examined the extent to which Ireland and the UK are perceived as similar alternatives with respect to factors that determine the location choice of foreign affiliates.</p>  <p>  The Report found that:</p>  <p>-  Over and above the effect of corporate tax rates, a number of other location characteristics are found to significantly increase countries  chances of being chosen as a location for FDI, including market size, access to the European Single Market, low production costs, high R&amp;D capacity, as well as cultural and geographical proximity relative to investors.</p>  <p>-  EU and non-EU investors value location characteristics differently.  Investors from outside the EU are mainly seeking access to the European Single Market and are more likely to choose locations with low corporate tax rates.  Intra-EU investments are more likely to be located in countries where the corporate tax is high but where they benefit from other local advantages such as low production costs.</p>  <p>  The research concludes that in addition to maintaining a competitive corporate tax rate, Ireland's attractiveness to FDI would benefit from policies aimed at maintaining cost competitiveness and enabling further R&amp;D investment.</p></reply>

These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.</p>  <p>  There are limited alleviation arrangements in place for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level.  These arrangements are mainly focused at post-primary level.  However, it is fair to say that before the moratorium, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed.</p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that the quality of school leadership is a key determinant of school effectiveness and the achievement of good learning outcomes.  Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning.  Therefore my Department, in consultation with the representative school management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support school leaders and how their needs might be addressed.</p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals.  It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders.  This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles. </p>  <p>  The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders.  Priorities for the Centre include a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals who are facing new challenges in the role, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards and the development of a quality assurance framework for leadership provision. </p>  <p>  In addition my Department will shortly publish Looking at Our School 2016, a quality framework for schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 and as part of the 2,260 additional teaching posts announced in that budget, 250 posts were provided to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed from teaching time and be more fully available for leadership in schools.  Thus with effect from 01 September 2016, second level schools with over 400 students will receive an allocation that will bring those schools in line with the schools that have over 500 pupils where the Deputy Principal is fully freed up for leadership in the school.  A pro rata allocation of additional hours to support school leadership will also be provided to the schools with 400 or fewer students enrolled. </p></reply>

In total, the number of SNA posts available has increased by almost 22% from 10,575 posts, available in 2011.  About 69% of all students with ASD access SNA support. </p>  <p>  In addition, there are currently over 11,800 learning support and Resource Teacher posts in mainstream primary and post-primary schools providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.  About 25% of all resource teaching posts are allocated for ASD.</p>  <p>  In respect of children with ASD who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with Special Educational Needs, including Autism. </p>  <p>  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.</p>  <p>  Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of Special Educational Needs, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting, but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post-primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children. </p>  <p>  Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are currently over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post-primary level of which 765 are for children with Autism.</p>  <p>  The NCSE recently published a list of special classes for the 2016/17 school year.  In total there will be 1,153 special classes available next year, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that for the coming school year there will be 127 early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approx.  16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism. </p>  <p>  Of these there will be 145 ASD classes in Cork City and County, including 24 Early Intervention Classes for children who are not yet school going age, 80 primary school classes and 41 at post-primary level in mainstream schools.  18 of these classes are new classes due to open in September 2016, 11 in primary schools and 7 in post-primary schools.  This will result in the provision of 144 places in early intervention classes, 480 places for primary school pupils and 246 places for post-primary pupils. </p>  <p>  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, including those in Cork City and County, are available on www.ncse.ie in county order, with new classes identified.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-07a.278.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070700077#WRG02200"><p>The correspondence to which the Deputy refers relates to school admissions and religious instruction in schools. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that a reply to the correspondent is currently being prepared.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to school admissions is that parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </p>  <p>  In relation to any amendments to section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act, it is acknowledged that any change to the Equal Status Act would be extremely difficult as this is a hugely complex area legally, constitutionally, and in other ways.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills, is to consider the complex issues raised by the Labour Party's proposed amendment to section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act as set out in their recently published Private Members Bill.  The Government proposed and the D&aacute;il agreed that this Bill proceed to second stage after these hearings are held.</p>  <p>  This will allow parents, children, patrons and other stakeholders to have their say.  Taking time to consider this complex issue in the relevant Oireachtas Committee, in the same way that all government legislation is subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, will ensure that the right balance can be struck between competing rights and that there would be no unintended consequence that would create an adverse impact on the schools of minority denominations. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I can advise that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 will be published this week.  The Bill will bring tangible benefits to all parents.  The Bill will oblige all schools to admit pupils where there are available places.  It is important to note that 80% of schools are not oversubscribed. </p>  <p>  In relation to the teaching of religion in schools, under the Constitution and in accordance with Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they so wish. </p>  <p>  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned.  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. </p>  <p>  The new Education (Admission to Schools) Bill will include a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of a school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard. </p>  <p>  A follow-up paper to Report of Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector was published in 2014.  The paper outlines good practice and options for promoting diversity in all schools and encourages school authorities to engage in consultation with stakeholders and to review their policies and practices on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain suitable for the school population that they serve.  One of the areas to be examined by schools relates to the scheduling of religion classes, and the paper gives an overview of different types of arrangements that schools can put in place in this regard.  This is an area I plan to keep under review.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also reflects the Government's objective of strengthening parental choice and further expanding diversity in our school system.  The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.  This represents a significant increase in the current rate of delivery of multidenominational schools.  The Government is committed to working with all stakeholders to progress this as a priority.  Since 2011 new schools are generally only established in areas of demographic growth.  My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places will arise. </p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of the school under this process and the level of parental preference for each patron is key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, all 24 new primary schools that have opened have been multi-denominational.

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has in this context developed short courses in Coding and Digital Media Literacy for use by schools.  Transition Year students have access to a module called 'Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games' and, under the ICT Action Plan, this is being expanded nationally.  I have also asked the NCCA to provide advice on the introduction of Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject.</p>  <p>  The revision of Leaving Certificate Applied Maths is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that computers will be used as a learning tool in aspects of the programme.  Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) are also significant components in the syllabuses of Technology and Design and Communication Graphics.  The focus in schools currently is on using ICT as a tool in learning guided by the ICT curriculum framework developed by the NCCA.  This is supported by digital content on the Scoilnet website, by professional development programmes for teachers and by investment in ICT infrastructure.  All post-primary schools are now connected to a 100Mbps broadband service, providing for improved integration of ICT in learning.</p>  <p>  The development of skills is key to successful learning and this is highlighted in the new Framework for Junior Cycle.  All of the 8 key skills in the Framework highlight the use of digital technology right across the junior cycle.  The use of 'technology and digital media tools to learn, communicate, work and think collaboratively and creatively in a responsible and ethical manner' is one of the statements of learning that inform the programme being offered by schools.  The use of ICT will permeate the experiences of all Junior Cycle students as the new Framework is implemented.</p></reply>

Since then my Department has written to the Commission regarding proposed budgetary amendments to reflect expected additional expenditure across some headings, possibly leading to an overall spend nearer to &euro;1.5m.  In this regard, my Department has requested the public beneficiary bodies to submit their expenditure declarations this month following which the final expenditure will become clearer.</p><p>The Lufthansa Technik Airmotive Ireland EGF programme ends on 19 September 2016 with a final reporting date of March 2017.

In general terms, the cost of pyrite remediation is largely dependent on the dwelling type, the number of units in a project, the floor area of the dwellings, the depth of hardcore in the units and the presence or otherwise of under-floor heating systems.  Against this background, remediation costs can vary significantly and may not always be directly comparable across projects.  While my Department monitors overall expenditure under the scheme, the costs associated with individual projects are determined by on-going competitive procurement processes which fall within the remit of the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  In this regard, dwellings which have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme are grouped into projects in order to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of the funds available to the scheme.  For each project, a specific programme is developed to facilitate the execution of the remedial works which, in many cases, is carried out on a phased basis.  The programme commences with the appointment of an engineer to survey the dwellings, prepare remedial works plans and the tender documents necessary to procure a works contractor to remediate the dwellings in the project.  The procurement of the engineer is undertaken in accordance with national procurement guidelines and EU procurement regulations.  A framework panel, comprising a list of engineers already qualified to carry out this type of work, has been established by the Housing Agency for this purpose.</p>  <p>  On completion of the remedial works plans, a separate tendering process is undertaken to engage a works contractor to remediate each of the dwellings in the project in accordance with their remedial works plans.  The procurement of the works contractor is also undertaken in accordance with public procurement rules.  Similar to the position with regard to the appointment of the engineer, a framework panel, comprising a list of works contractors already qualified to carry out this type of work, has been established by the Housing Agency from which tender proposals are received.</p>  <p>  Remedial works are carried out by the successful works contractor in accordance with the remedial works plans and I.S. 398-2: 2013: Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hard core material &ndash; Part 2: Methodology for remediation works.  The engineer will undertake inspections at critical points during the process in order to issue the Certificate of Remediation in accordance with Annex B of I.S. 398-2: 2013.</p></reply>

In discussions prior to the adoption of the 2007 Tyre Regulations, it was made clear that this was the last opportunity for the tyre industry to embrace environmental compliance and take responsibility for the waste it produces.  If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model.</p>  <p>  As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed.  The results of this examination were stark.  The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:</p>  <p>  -  A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,</p>  <p>  -  A lack of consistent and accurate data,</p>  <p>  -  That the current system was not tracking data flows well, and</p>  <p>  -  Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for with widespread illegal dumping. </p>  <p>  There will be no new tyre tax or levy under the new system.  Consumers already pay a disposal fee to their tyre retailer whenever they buy a new tyre.  The model that I am introducing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to.  It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures it is properly directed in the future so that the consumer does not pay twice: once at the point of purchase and again when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres. </p>  <p>  Repak ELT replaced TRACS as the sole compliance scheme for tyres as of 1 November 2015.  Repak have a long and successful track record under existing producer responsibility arrangements in the packaging area and have been instrumental in making Ireland a top EU per former in this waste stream.  The new system will provide a sustainable and environmentally focused system for the management of waste tyres.  Like existing systems for waste tyres elsewhere in the EU and for all other waste streams in Ireland, this system will respect the producer responsibility approach and be based on the polluter pays principle.  These are long-standing environmental principles which are reflected in both European and domestic legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently drafting regulations to underpin the new Tyres and Waste Tyres Compliance Scheme and the intention is that these regulations will come into effect from 1 January 2017, which will also be the commencement date for the full PRI Scheme.</p></reply>

On foot of arbitration procedures, Kildare County Council recently successfully completed an agreement with one of two site owners, relating to the provision of roads infrastructure to service the town centre site.  The arbitration case relating to the second site owner remains to be heard by the Property Arbitrator, the hearing of which is not scheduled to take place until April 2017, due to the Property Arbitrator&rsquo;s caseload.  In parallel with these arbitration cases, the Council has also been involved in ongoing discussions with the owner of the town centre site, and his agents, with a view to advancing development of the site as early as possible. </p>  <p>  With relevant processes underway involving NAMA and arbitration, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister to become involved or make any further comment on the matter.   </p></reply>

The preparation of a draft Initial Assessment (under Art. 8 of the MSFD), including proposals for Good Environmental Status (Art. 9) and for draft Environmental Targets (Art. 10), is underpinned by a suite of monitoring measures to measure the maritime environment against these targets (Art. 11).

Similar to other self-employed workers, farmers pay PRSI, along with income tax and USC, with their annual return using Revenue's self-assessment system.  The payment of the annual class S PRSI payment by self-employed workers means that 52 paid contributions are awarded to their social insurance record in respect of that contribution year.</p><p>Where farmers and other self-employed workers earn less than &euro;5,000 in a particular contribution year, they are not liable to pay PRSI.  To protect their social insurance record they may opt to pay voluntary contributions, subject to satisfying the qualifying conditions.  To become a voluntary contributor, a person must have paid at least 520 weeks PRSI in either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of the contribution year in which they were last paid PRSI.  The voluntary contribution payment for the self-employed is a single flat rate annual payment of &euro;500, which results in 52 paid contributions being awarded to their social insurance record in respect of that contribution year.  The majority of people paying voluntary contributions are former self-employed workers.  Full details of the voluntary contribution scheme are provided on the Department's website <i>www.welfare.ie</i>and are also available from the Citizens Information Board (CIB).</p><p>The system of PRSI for employees differs, in that it applies on a weekly and not annual basis.  In general, employees are liable to pay PRSI at 4% on weekly earnings in excess of &euro;352, which is deducted at source and remitted through the PAYE system.  In addition, their employers pay PRSI at 8.5% for weekly earnings between &euro;38 and &euro;376 and at the rate of 10.75% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Paid contributions are only awarded to employees&rsquo; social insurance record for each week they have been in insurable employment.</p><p>Employees also have the opportunity of applying to pay voluntary contributions in respect of weeks for which they are not working and for which no paid contribution is awarded to their social insurance record, subject to satisfying the qualifying conditions.  Voluntary contributions for employees are based on their income in the previous year and the rate of payment depends on the nature of their employment.  For most former employees, voluntary contributions are payable at rate of 6.6%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  </p></reply>

Supports in relation to housing and the provision of financial supports, including the rent supplement scheme currently supporting some 54,000 recipients at a cost of &euro;267 million in 2016, are a key priority as evidenced by the early implementation of this Government commitment.</p>  <p>  The rent limit review sets maximum rent limits in line with market rents which have generally been benchmarked at the 35th percentile of agreed rents as registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.  Each county&rsquo;s major urban area was used to establish an appropriate benchmark for the county&rsquo;s prevailing maximum rent limit.  In the case of Kildare, excluding the towns of: Maynooth; Leixlip; Celbridge; and Kilcock, the major urban centre selected for this county as the main benchmark in establishing maximum rent limits was Naas.  The Deputy referred to other market areas in county Kildare namely, Newbridge, Monasterevin and by extension Kilcullen, which have lower rental pricing than Naas, and are covered under the county Kildare limits.  The rent limits in county Kildare have increased by a weighted average of 19%.</p>  <p>  Higher rent limits continue to be provided for the areas of Maynooth, Leixlip, Celbridge and Kilcock where the rental price differential remains.  A weighted average increase was applied to the rents in these areas of 25%, reflecting the market conditions.</p>  <p>  The combination of the increased rent limits and the ongoing flexibility and discretionary increases provided by my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service staff, in addition to the supports provided under Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service (available in Kildare), will continue to provide stability for tenants.</p></reply>

T&uacute;s is designed to break the cycle of unemployment, and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market<b>.  </b>For this reason, eligibility is confined to those in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  These provisions are to ensure a highly targeted approach for those in danger of falling into long-term unemployment.  While T&uacute;s is intended to help long-term unemployed people re-enter the active workforce, they are not full-time sustainable jobs.</p><p>T&uacute;s was introduced and the numbers on other schemes expanded as a direct response to the growth in the level of unemployment during the financial crisis.  As the economic recovery takes hold and the overall level of unemployment falls, the Department recognises the need to adapt these schemes to the changing circumstances, opportunities and needs of jobseekers and others.</p><p>International literature regularly questions the effectiveness of work programmes in general as effective activation tools, citing concerns regarding the duration of programmes, proximity to the labour market, absence of job search, possibility of lock-in effects and poor outcomes in terms of employment among others.  In order to be effective, research points to the need for any such schemes to be temporary and should not become a disguised form of subsidised permanent employment.</p><p>Furthermore, extending the period of participation on T&uacute;s beyond one year for current participants would reduce the number of placements available to other people who are long-term unemployed.  The existing 12-month placement period on T&uacute;s is consider adequate at present to meet the objectives of the initiative whilst also ensuring that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from it.</p><p>With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, a review of work schemes, including T&uacute;s, will be necessary to ensure that the number and nature of schemes and the conditions governing participation continue to be appropriate.  I will be considering all of these issues over the coming months.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Significant resources continue to be deployed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Cairo and in Dublin, in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to both this citizen and his family.</p><p>I and my Government colleagues are extremely disappointed at the news of a further delay in the trial of this citizen.  This latest delay is a particular source of concern and frustration for the citizen and his family and we fully share their sense of frustration.  I met with this citizen&rsquo;s father and sister on Tuesday 28 June, in advance of the hearing, to reaffirm our continued commitment to securing his release. </p><p>A further meeting between the family and my officials took place on Friday, 1 July,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>where the latest developments were reviewed and options for future action, including a new application under Presidential Decree 140, were considered.  The Irish Government intends to lend its full support to a further request for release under the Presidential decree/Law 140, and will continue to work in support of these efforts.  I further met with members of the Halawa family today (7 July 2016) before and after a parliamentary debate on this consular case.</p><p>My own concerns and that of the Government about this delay have been conveyed directly to the Egyptian Government.  I met with the Ambassador of Egypt last Thursday<font color="#FF0000"> </font>and asked that she convey to her authorities in Cairo my disappointment and frustration at this further postponement of the trial.  The Taoiseach spoke by phone with President el-Sisi on Monday last, 4 July, to convey the Government&rsquo;s concerns directly to the President and to renew our call for this citizen to be released.  He again met members of the Halawa family today (7 July 2016).</p><p>All actions taken in this case are considered in light of the Government&rsquo;s clear objectives: first, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, second, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by the Taoiseach, Ministers and by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to date in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests.</p><p>In addition to engagement with the Egyptian authorities, the Government also frequently engages with other states who have had citizens in similar situations, with our European and international partners represented in Egypt, and with the European Union.  I have engaged extensively with High Representative Ms Federica Mogherini, who has raised this case with Foreign Minister Shoukry.  The Taoiseach has also discussed this citizen&rsquo;s detention at the highest level with President el-Sisi on three occasions, and those lines of communication remain open.  The Egyptian Government is in no doubt about the Irish Government&rsquo;s position and our desire to see our citizen released as soon as possible.</p><p>Ultimately, any decision to release this citizen will be made solely by the Egyptian authorities.  Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any detention abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release. </p><p>Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in Cairo, remain in ongoing contact with the citizen&rsquo;s family.  They will continue to engage appropriately with the Egyptian authorities, will remain resolute in seeking to protect the interests of this Irish citizen, and will do all possible to achieve a positive outcome.  They also liaise closely with his Egyptian legal team and have attended all trial hearings to date.

The referendum outcome has potentially far-reaching implications for EU-Switzerland relations, not least because any new Swiss legislation introducing quotas on immigration by EU citizens would be incompatible with the existing EU-Switzerland Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons which has been in place since 2002.</p>  <p>  Last month, the Swiss Parliament made ratification of Protocol III (extending the EU-Swiss Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons to Croatia) contingent on securing a satisfactory outcome to the discussions with the EU in relation to Switzerland&rsquo;s 2014 initiative on &ldquo;mass immigration&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The opening of the Swiss labour market to Croatia was part of a deal permitting Switzerland to take part in the European research and development programme Horizon 2020 and the Erasmus exchange programme.  The EU has always made clear that there is a close link between Swiss participation in Erasmus and the Protocol, as the programme is closely linked to the free movement of persons (exchange of researchers and students).  Given the circumstances arising from the February 2014 vote, the EU and the Swiss authorities agreed to suspend on-going negotiations on Swiss participation in Erasmus.  Until the current difficulties are resolved, Switzerland will not participate in Erasmus on an equal footing with Member States as initially envisaged, but will rather enjoy the same status as other third countries (as a "Partner Country").</p>  <p>  For its part the EU refuses to entertain any negotiation on the principle of the Free Movement of Persons, a position Ireland fully supports.</p></reply>

The situation in the South China Sea, through which a significant amount of world trade passes each year, is of interest to Ireland, as a small open economy.  We therefore closely monitor the ongoing developments in the region.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, is committed to maintaining a legal order for the seas and oceans based upon the principles of international law, as reflected notably in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  This includes the maintenance of freedom of navigation.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, does not take a position on the individual claims in the South China Sea.  However, we are concerned at the potential for a dangerous escalation of tensions in the area in question.  It is our strong wish to see these disputes resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, and we urge the parties involved to refrain from actions that could lead to increased tensions in the region. </p>  <p>  ASEAN and China adopted the Declaration on the Conducts of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) in November 2002.  After a series of discussions, ASEAN and China adopted the Guidelines to implement the DOC in July 2011.  They have committed to a range of principles, which include: building, maintaining and enhancing mutual trust and confidence; exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities; and the peaceful resolution of disputes.  Furthermore, the Parties to the DOC agreed to working towards the eventual realisation of a Code of Conduct on the South China Sea (COC), on the basis of consensus.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, supports the full implementation of the DOC, and looks forward to a swift conclusion of the talks on a COC, which will further support a rules-based regional and international order.</p></reply>

On the Friday when the result was announced I spoke with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First and deputy First Ministers and the leaders of the Northern Irish political parties. </p>  <p>  Last Wednesday, the Secretary of State and I convened the Quarterly Review Meeting of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements, which was attended by the First and deputy First Ministers and the Northern Ireland Justice Minister and at which the referendum result was discussed.  In addition to the Review Meeting, I held a separate bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Villiers during which we discussed the issue, as I did in meetings with the SDLP leader and the leader of the Alliance Party.</p>  <p>  The referendum outcome was also on the agenda at Monday&rsquo;s NSMC Plenary hosted by the Taoiseach at Dublin Castle.  My Cabinet colleagues and I participated together with the Ministers of the Northern Ireland Executive led by the First and deputy First Ministers.</p>  <p>  During the NSMC Plenary, there was a detailed discussion on the potential impact of the UK referendum result to leave the EU.  At the meeting, the NSMC agreed on ten specific areas where there would be joint planning and engagement.  Furthermore, the economy and trade; Northern Ireland and British Irish relations; the Common Travel Area; and the EU were highlighted as the four priority areas where implications arise as result of the referendum vote.</p>  <p>  The NSMC Plenary followed on from last week&rsquo;s Quarterly Review Meeting of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements and my separate bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Villiers.  Naturally the outcome of the UK referendum on the EU was a key element of these meetings and I took the opportunity to assure all those present of the priority the Government attaches to the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland in the aftermath of the referendum. </p>  <p>  I emphasised the necessity and importance of working together in the best interests of the people on this island.  I reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to work in support of stability, reconciliation and prosperity in Northern Ireland.  In this regard the Government will use its influence with our EU partners to seek to persuade them of the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island &ndash; a process to which the EU has already made a key contribution.  In addition I outlined that the Common Travel Area and cross-border EU funding, are key priorities for the Government in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the deep concerns and anxiety that have arisen for many people across the community in Northern Ireland about the referendum outcome.  The fact that the majority within Northern Ireland who voted to remain now face their preference being set aside as a result of the overall result across the UK raises profound issues. </p>  <p>  In this regard, in my bilateral meeting with Secretary of State Villiers we agreed that the Good Friday Agreement remains the foundation for the two Governments&rsquo; approach to Northern Ireland.  The EU referendum result does not in any way diminish the centrality of the Good Friday Agreement or the requirement of both the British and Irish Governments to uphold it.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday and succeeding Agreements, the Irish Government is determined that its institutions, values and principles &ndash; including the right to be British or Irish or both - will be fully protected. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I noted that any future arrangements will not exclusively be determined by the wishes of the Irish Government, the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  They will also be influenced by the wider negotiations between the UK and the EU of 27 remaining Member States.  One of the challenges, therefore, will be for Ireland to use its influence with our EU partners to persuade them of the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island.</p></reply>

The Council agreed that the implications of the referendum decision on North South cooperation should be explored in detail for all sectors.  In order to optimise joint planning and engagement on key issues arising following the UK referendum result, the NSMC agreed to work together to ensure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected and advanced and the benefits of North/South co-operation are fully recognised in any new arrangements which emerge as regards the United Kingdom&rsquo;s future relationship with the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Council agreed that a full audit will be undertaken in all NSMC sectors, which include the six North South Bodies and Tourism Ireland Ltd., to identify the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising in the phases preceding and following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  It was also agreed that Ministers North and South at their forthcoming NSMC Sectoral meetings will consider the strategic and cross-cutting issues arising and that final priorities will be agreed by the next NSMC Plenary in November for both pre-negotiation and negotiation phases.</p>  <p>  All of the North South Bodies are testament to the benefit of working together for mutual benefit, and in the light of the Referendum result it will be important that the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government continue to fully support the work of the Bodies.    </p>  <p>  The North South Bodies are playing a continuing and central role in our economic recovery, with Tourism Ireland driving record tourism numbers to this island and InterTradeIreland building vital exporting capacity among our small and medium enterprises, the mainstay of the all-island economy.  Another North South Body, the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), is the Managing Authority for various EU Programmes. </p>  <p>  At the NSMC Plenary meeting the Council re-iterated the joint commitment of the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to the successful implementation of the EU&rsquo;s PEACE and INTERREG programmes, and agreed that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Northern Ireland Finance Minister will consider the issue of securing the ERDF funding for PEACE and INTERREG, including through engagement with the European Commission.</p></reply>

Work is underway to ensure that capabilities and resources are put in place to manage the complex process of a UK exit from the EU.</p>  <p>  I am happy to set out the resources which are in place in my Department as of today.  Within my Department, lead responsibility for the UK-EU relationship lies with Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division, within which there is a dedicated British-Irish Relations Unit currently staffed by five officers.  This Unit works very closely with colleagues in the wider IUKA Division, especially those colleagues focused on Northern Ireland.  Supporting and sustaining peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland is a key priority for my Department and protecting the interests of Northern Ireland will be a crucial element of our approach to any negotiations regarding the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.  </p>  <p>  The Department also has a Policy Planning Unit which was established in 2014 and has provided policy analysis to the IUKA Division.  In addition, there is also an intra-Departmental contact group on the UK-EU relationship, comprising senior officials across all of our relevant units. </p>  <p>  In terms of Irish offices abroad focused on the UK-EU relationship, I would list in particular the Embassy of Ireland in London, the Consulate General of Ireland in Edinburgh, our offices in Belfast and Armagh, and the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels.  Missions across the EU and further afield are all working on this issue, especially as the expected UK exit process approaches. </p>  <p>  I would also add that seven diplomatic officers of the Department are seconded to the European Union Division in the Department of the Taoiseach, while two diplomatic officers are seconded to the International and EU Relations Division of the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

My Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations services since my entry into office in May 2016.  The expenditure in question has rather arisen in the context of specific initiatives under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme for which we have from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.</p><p>DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day celebrations.</p><p>The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year, including the annual SCMF student competition.  This typically involves the following activities: </p><p>Convening national and regional information workshops;</p><p>Managing and administering the application process;</p><p>Organising the judging process</p><p>Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;</p><p>Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;</p><p>Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  </p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.  This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  DHR was awarded a two-year contract in April 2015 following a competitive tendering process.</p><p>Following a further competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day 2016 flagship event in Dublin.  Like annual Africa Day events held over successive years, this incorporated musical entertainment and cultural activities aimed principally at family audiences.  DHR&rsquo;s role involved the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which they managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website.  This work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.</p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed in the table.  This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety matters and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.</p><p>The following table sets out the payments to DHR since May 2016.</p><p><b>Project/Event</b><table><tr><th>Project/Event</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications &ndash; Africa Day</td><td>&euro;151,861.20</td></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications &ndash; Simon Cumbers Media Fund</td><td>&euro;8,047.34</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Recruitment and promotions are made on the basis of an agreed method of sequence.  Sequences vary for each grade and usually involve a combination of open, interdepartmental and internal panels.  Qualification and placement on a panel is not a guarantee of appointment to a position.</p><p>The duration of Interdepartmental and Internal panels are generally agreed at the beginning of each campaign, extensions may be agreed provided there are objective reasons for doing so, but it is the norm that panels will finish at the agreed time.</p><p>The rationale for limiting panels are twofold.  Firstly it gives people on the panel an opportunity to be recruited or promoted.  Secondly, it ensures that panels are not left in place for long periods with no opportunity for others to compete.</p><p>Other factors determining the use and duration of panels would be determined by a number of factors including demand, required skills and workforce planning, with reference to their pay budgets.</p></reply>

For all those on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 there will be a flat rate increase in gross pay of &euro;1,000 from 1 September 2017.  Additionally, all public servants will benefit from the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) measures contained in the Lansdowne Road Agreement which will benefit all affected public servants by up to &euro;733 in 2016 and &euro;1,000 in 2017.  However, through the operation of the tax code, lower paid public servants will benefit proportionately more from the PRD measures.</font></p><p>The combined impact of these measures, for example, on a public servant on a salary of &euro;25,000 will be an additional &euro;1 ,875 over the duration of the Agreement a 7.5% increase. </p><p>The Agreement is also flexible enough to allow for the concerns of recent recruits to the public service to be addressed in a negotiated way and in return for work place reform to drive greater productivity in the public service, as has already been agreed with representative bodies of one group of public servants.</p><p>The Programme for Government also states that the Government will establish a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service including any issues relating to new entrants' pay.  The precise structure of such a commission and the technical aspects as to how it will  operate have yet to be decided upon and will require broad consultation, including engagement with staff representatives as was committed to in the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p></reply>

The current position is as follows - </p>  <p>  The detailed design phase for both the new bridge installation and flood defences is underway.  The required comprehensive surveying to inform the detailed design is being carried out.  Ecology surveys commenced on site in Feb 2016 and are ongoing.  Traffic surveys were completed in March 2016. Topographic &amp;amp; Bathymetric surveys were carried out on site during April &amp;amp; May 2016.  The Archaeological survey of the river bed was completed in May 2016.  The Invasive Species survey was completed in June 2016. </p>  <p>  Site investigations works commenced on site in June 2016 and will continue in the town centre, along the river bed and river banks, and in the adjacent roads and footpaths throughout July.  This work requires the drilling of boreholes and the excavation of trial pits and trenches to identify existing ground conditions and the location of underground services. </p>  <p>  It is hoped to hold a public display of the proposed works later in 2016, and to submit the proposed scheme for formal Confirmation or approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and commence the procurement process for a works contractor in late 2016 with a view to construction commencing in the first half of 2017.</p></reply>

It sets out a series of measures to ensure that Ireland meets its obligations under the EU Habitats Directive to maintain or restore raised bog habitat to favourable conservation status, as well as its obligations under the EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive relating to the regulation of turf cutting on natural heritage areas, whilst at the same time avoiding unnecessary impacts on the traditional rights of landowners and users and minimising the cost to the State of compensation payments.</p><p>The review concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This will entail:</p><p>-  The phasing out by 1 January 2017 of turf-cutting on 36 existing natural heritage areas, which will remain designated - this includes 7 sites to be divided, with part to be conserved and part de-designated; </p><p>-  The complete de-designation of 46 natural heritage areas - including the relevant areas of the 7 sites to be divided - where it has been judged that their contribution to the attainment of the national conservation objective for raised bog is expected to be marginal and/or restoration would be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved. Domestic turf-cutting may continue on these sites, while larger scale or commercial turf cutting will continue to be regulated through other consent systems; and</p><p>-  The designation as natural heritage areas of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, so as to compensate for the loss of habitat within the sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can be allowed to continue.</p><p>The review clearly sets out that the newly configured network will have considerable advantages over the current natural heritage area network.  While the review proposes the de-designation of a number of natural heritage areas, this will be more than balanced by the proposed designation of new natural heritage areas.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>includes a commitment to publish the new legislation to de-designate the natural heritage areas in question within the first 100 days of Government.  The drafting of this legislation has now been approved and the General Scheme of the Bill has been referred for consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

It is not a natural heritage area which is scheduled for de-designation.  Therefore, the restrictions on turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation, including on the site referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, will not be affected by the proposed de-designation of the natural heritage areas in question.</p>  <p>  In the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department is considering the available options for turf cutters in terms of relocation to non-designated bogs and the utilisation of the relevant provisions of the EU Habitats Directive.  Under article 6.3 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of the site.  Under article 6.4 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest and where no alternatives exist.</p>  <p>  Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases.  Similarly, the flexibility provided for under article 6.4, if required, will only be applicable to a small number of sites.</p>  <p>  I am advised that, as my Department has identified a suitable relocation site for turf cutters from the special area of conservation site referred to by the Deputy, this site is not one of those sites for which the utilisation of article 6.3 or article 6.4 of the Directive is being considered.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:  </p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; </p>  <p>  - Bed and board;</p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and  </p>  <p>  - Laundry service.</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home. </p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, e.g. social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  </p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, published in July 2015, looked at the issue of additional costs in private nursing homes and made the following recommendations: </p>  <p>  - Nursing homes should have a published fee schedule showing all the costs associated with being a  resident. </p>  <p>  - Consideration should be given to introducing a new provision under the scheme to prohibit the levying of additional charges for any service or facility from which residents can not readily opt out without penalty while remaining as residents of that facility, or in which they cannot participate because of their level of dependency. </p>  <p>  - Consideration should be given to including in the price contracts with facilities, details of what additional charges are proposed, of the opt-out arrangements that exist for residents and confirmation that residents will not be charged for extra services that they cannot participate in because of their dependency or lack of capacity.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  A specific date has not been set for the Group to conclude its work, but it is in the process of reporting on its progress to date to the Cabinet Committee on Health.  This will be done shortly, in line with the Committee's own scheduling requirements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-07a.631.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070700085#WRP02500"><p>The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) is a self funding independent body with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The NMBI's income from 2012 to 2016 is as set out below and is funded largely by the annual retention fee:  </p><p>- 2012: 6.9m; </p><p>- 2013: 6.7m; </p><p>- 2014: 8.7m;  </p><p>- 2015: 8.3m (estimate);  </p><p>- 2016: 8.8m (estimate).</p><p>On 28 May 2015, the Minister for Health approved the proposal for the provision of interim funding for the NMBI through a process undertaken as part of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  It was agreed to maintain the Annual Retention Fee (ARF) of nurses at &euro;100 for the duration of the Agreement (2015-2018).  Maintaining the ARF at &euro;100 rather than the required &euro;150 leaves a significant shortfall in the budget of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  This shortfall has implications for the full implementation of the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 (NMA 2011).  The Department of Health agreed to provide appropriate capital funding while working with the Board to ensure its financial plans are realistic and cost effective.  The Department also undertook to provide, if required, upfront Exchequer funding of developmental costs, once properly justified and validated, until the expiry of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The funding from the Exchequer is therefore contingent on the Board implementing a cost containment plan agreed with the Department of Health.</p><p>The number of staff in the NMBI currently stands at 51.3 WTE (comprising 22.6 permanent; 11.7 contract and 17 agency).  Since end July 2015, the Department has sanctioned the filling of 25 posts, the majority of which are existing posts that became vacant when staff left the organisation.  The information in relation to the staff changes over the last 5 years is an operational matter and as such, it is appropriate that it should be dealt with by the NMBI.  I have referred that aspect of the Deputy's question to the NMBI for attention and direct reply.  If you have not received a reply from the NMBI within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office  and they will follow up the matter with them.</p><p>With regard to registration, there were 1,947 open cases on 31 May 2016.  In this regard, many of the applications received are incomplete whereby documents remain outstanding and therefore the matter cannot be progressed to review/assessment stage until these are received.  In addition, many applicants do not fully complete their application form fully therefore leading to delays in progressing an application through the system.  </p><p>Summary details regarding number of nurse/midwife registrations is provided in the following table.<table><tr><th>Date</th><th>Received</th><th>Registered</th><th>Adaptation/assessment/aptitude <br /><br />decisions issued</th><th>files closed</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2534</td><td>1039</td><td>625</td><td>1494</td></tr><tr><td>1/1/16&ndash; 31/5/16</td><td>1650</td><td>593</td><td>681</td><td>244</td></tr></table>Please note that the Board has taken a decision to close files in respect of applicants who did not submit the required documentation within one year &ndash; this period was reduced to a six month timeframe for applications submitted on or after 1st March 2016. </p><p>The NMBI fully recognises the challenges being experienced by health service employers in the public and the private sector and NMBI is meeting and liaising with employers to address the registration issues.  NMBI is also liaising with a large number of recruitment agencies on a daily and weekly basis to support the recruitment and registration process.  Senior NMBI staff are also endeavoring to explore the best ways of improving the efficiency of the existing process, whilst still maintaining the standards of education and professional competence required to enable registration.  A new streamlined application form and information booklet was also launched earlier this year.</p><p>Various measures including enhanced website functionality, additional staff appointments and ongoing process improvement work by NMBI staff is assisting in making headway in the management of the increasing volumes of applications received by NMBI to facilitate new nurses and midwives entering the Irish health system as quickly as possible without compromising standards.

The response from the NMBI is set out below.</p>  <p>  Once all relevant documentation on a nurse or midwife's application is received the file is assessed by the NMBI.  At the end of 2015, the timeframe for assessment of applications once all required documentation had been submitted was a maximum of 90 days.  As of 31 May 2016, this had been reduced to a maximum of 45 days.  Currently, there are no EU applications awaiting assessment. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that most applicants from non-EU countries are not eligible for direct registration with the NMBI as their education programmes do not meet NMBI requirements and standards for such programmes.  The usual outcome for such applications is a &lsquo;decision letter&rsquo;.  This specifies that the applicant must successfully complete an Aptitude Test or a period of Adaptation and Assessment as a prerequisite to registration.  Once an applicant get the decision letter, he/she must apply for the Aptitude Test or the period of Adaptation and Assessment.  Once successfully completed, they then progress to registration by the NMBI.</p>  <p>  The NMBI fully recognises the challenges being experienced by health service employers in the public and the private sector.  The NMBI is meeting and liaising with employers on a regular basis to address the registration issues.  The NMBI is also liaising with a large number of recruitment agencies on a daily and weekly basis to support the recruitment and registration process.  Feedback from recruitment agencies in recent months has been very positive and recognises the improvements that have been made by NMBI.  Senior NMBI staff are also endeavoring to explore the best ways of improving the efficiency of the existing process, whilst still maintaining the standards of education and professional competence required to enable registration.  A new streamlined application form and information booklet was also launched earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Various measures including enhanced website functionality, additional staff appointments and ongoing process improvement work by NMBI staff is assisting in making headway in the management of the increasing volumes of applications received by NMBI to facilitate new nurses and midwives entering the Irish health system as quickly as possible without compromising standards.</p></reply>

ED attendances have been significantly higher this year, particularly in the peak winter period of Quarter 1.  To date, the HSE has reported an average increase in ED attendances of nearly 6% compared with the same period last year.</p>  <p>  However, overall this year so far, we have seen a decrease of just over 7% in the number of patients who have had to wait on a trolley, in comparison with the same period in 2015.</p>  <p>  While ED attendances at Mayo University Hospital have been almost 10% higher year to date, we have seen a decrease of approximately 8% in the number of patients waiting on trolleys, in comparison with the same period in 2015.  </p>  <p>  Patient experience times at end May 2016 show that nationally 71% of patients complete their episode of care in ED within 6 hours and 85% within 9 hours of registration.  In this regard Mayo University Hospital is performing better than average with 75% within 6 hours and 91% within 9 Hours.</p>  <p>  The ED at Mayo Hospital was originally designed for 20,000 presentations per year; however, in 2015, Mayo saw 35,515 people.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to progress a new ED facility for University Hospital Galway, which will reduce pressure on EDs across the Saolta Group, including at Mayo University Hospital.  </p>  <p>  In January of this year the Primary Care Centre in Castlebar commenced participation in the Primary Care Ultrasound Project, which will increase access to diagnostic facilities in the Mayo region, and reduce pressure on Mayo University Hospital.</p>  <p>  Several national initiatives such as: the ongoing work of the ED Taskforce and SDU; the 2016-2018 Winter Initiative, the national review of bed capacity; and the review of the hours of service of Medical Assessment Units, are intended to alleviate ED pressures at all hospitals, including Mayo. </p></reply>

It also provides for 15,450 Home Care Packages and 130 Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs.  A further 60 clients with dementia will be supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.</p>  <p>  Home support services across the country are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  Activity in the first quarter of 2016 was ahead of the same period last year as efforts continued to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that the Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40 m for home care in 2016.  This will ensure that the home support services provided in 2015 are maintained and that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months.  &euro;10 m of this money has been ring fenced for home care as part of the new winter initiative.  The targets for 2016 will be reviewed in light of these additional resources.</p></reply>

Accordingly, many respite episodes would not attract any charge.</p>  <p>  Charges for the maintenance element of long-stay in-patient services &ndash; which may include in-patient respite care services  &ndash; are provided for under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 and the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005, as amended. </p>  <p>  The Regulations provide for two different classes of income-based charges in respect of the maintenance element of the in-patient services provided:</p>  <p>  -  Class 1 relates to charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24-hour nursing care is provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;175 per week for a person whose income is &euro;208 or more, and</p>  <p>  -  Class 2 charges apply where 24-hour nursing care is not provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 or more. </p>  <p>  Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the charging provisions under the 2005 Act and Regulations:</p>  <p>  -  Firstly, the Act caps the amount which may be charged &ndash; at 80% of the non-contributory State Pension weekly rate.  At present, that means an upper limit of &euro;177.60 per week.</p>  <p>  -  Secondly, the charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a reasonable income for personal use: at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates</p>  <p>  -  Thirdly, the Act provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person if necessary to avoid undue financial hardship. </p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the 2005 Act and Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination of long-stay charges for in-patient services.  These include the need to have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants. The guidelines ensure that the applicable charge is determined taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments.  This avoids any unfair burden on the service user or his or her dependants.</p>  <p>  As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.  I have asked the HSE to look into the particular matter raised and to reply directly to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

This sub-committee will build on initial work completed to undertake a full audit of the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising over the longer term, in the phases preceding and following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  It includes representatives from each division within the Department and is chaired at senior level.</p>  <p>  Staff from my Department are in regular contact with other Departments on the issue of the UK vote to leave the EU.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-07a.763.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016070700088#WRS02300"><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine fully complies with the terms and conditions of licences issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to remove badgers in the context of its Bovine TB eradication programme.  My officials work very closely with those of the NPWS in implementing this policy and are in constant contact on the badger capturing programme, including at local level, to ensure that the conditions of the licences are being monitored and met.</p>  <p>  Our policy of removing badgers is based on very considerable scientific evidence of a link between badgers and cattle in the context of the spread of bovine Tuberculosis.  Research conducted by the Department and others has demonstrated that the eradication of bovine TB is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed.  It is therefore necessary to eradicate TB in both species.  I would stress that the removal of badgers is undertaken only in areas where badgers are the likely source of infection.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department believes that the removal of badgers has contributed significantly to the very substantial reduction in the incidence of TB in cattle in recent years.  The incidence of bovine TB in Ireland has declined significantly since 2008 when approximately 30,000 animals were removed as reactors to just c. 15,300 in 2015.  Herd incidence, which is another measure of trends, was at c.3.37% in 2015 compared with 5.88% in 2008.  This is a historically low level.  I am satisfied that the badger removal policy is the main factor in the reduction in the incidence of the disease and I would draw attention to the situation in Northern Ireland, which does not implement a badger culling programme, and where the incidence of TB is almost twice as high as ours.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the badger removal policy is a temporary measure pending the development of a suitable vaccine for use in badgers as it is our intention to gradually replace culling with vaccination.  Accordingly, the Department has been collaborating for some years with the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) in UCD and with DEFRA in the UK on research into a vaccine to control tuberculosis in badgers.  A number of vaccination projects, replacing repeated culling in already culled areas, have been implemented since 2013.  If these projects are ultimately successful in demonstrating that vaccination is as effective as continued culling, vaccination will become an increasingly important part of the national eradication strategy, provided that any obstacles relating to the delivery of the vaccine are overcome. </p></reply>

My Department and our agencies, in association with our stakeholders, have been giving careful consideration to this issue for some time, looking at the areas in which the greatest risks may arise and on which we will need to focus when negotiations begin.</p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for agri-food exporters centre on exchange rates.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.  In addition, I asked Bord Bia to provide practical guidance to SMEs to assist them in dealing with marketing challenges arising in the short term, and yesterday it announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, the provision of consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement, and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned, and I have convened a consultative committee of stakeholders to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed.  The Department will also continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

Food security has four main dimensions - food availability, food access, utilisation and stability.  At national level, food security is addressed through a range of Government policies providing social protection and supports for low income, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.  At EU level, Ireland is engaged in research under a number of  EU Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs).</p><p>Within my Department planning for food availability takes place with in the context of FoodWise 2025, the 10-year vision of sustainable growth for Irish agri-food.  This strategy identified significant growth opportunities across the Irish agri-food industry.  Cumulatively, it projects that exports have the potential to grow to &euro;19bn per annum in value by 2015, representing a considerable increase on the &euro;10.8 billion in agri-food and drink products exportedin 2015 to over 175 markets worldwide.  Implementation of the strategy overall and at sectoral level is monitored by a High Level Implementation Committee, which I chair. </p><p>In most sectors Ireland is a net exporter, indeed Ireland exports over 80% of the agri-food it produces.  In the case of horticulture, Food Wise 2025 outlines the potential to grow the farm gate value of Irish horticultural output to over &euro;500m in the medium term.  Exports are less of a feature than in other sectors, with the exception of mushrooms.</p><p>While there is potential to increase production of certain horticultural crops in Ireland, in some cases it may not be economic to do so.  Some crops can&rsquo;t be grown under Irish climatic conditions; other crops can only be grown economically at certain times of year or in certain parts of the country.  Consumer desire for high quality fresh fruit and vegetables coupled with the high perishability of certain fresh fruit combine to create a situation where Ireland can&rsquo;t be fully self-sufficient in terms of horticultural production.  Notwithstanding this situation the Government is committed to maintaining and where possible developing Ireland&rsquo;s potential to produce food.</p><p>My Department implements two specific schemes to promote development of the horticulture sector.  These are the State funded Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector and the EU funded Producer Organisation Scheme.  Both schemes aim to promote the sustainable development of the industry with a focus on maximising grower competitiveness, aligning production with consumer demand and respect for the environment.  The EU has co-funded mushroom promotions undertaken by Bord Bia in partnership with the sector for several years.  My own Department has also contributed funding, together with the EU and the trade for a successful three year potato promotion &quot;Potatoes &ndash; More than a Bit on the Side&quot;. </p><p>The Food Dudes and Food Dudes Boost programmes, co-funded by my Department under the EU School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme, have developed in schoolchildren in national schools a taste for fresh fruit and vegetables leading to increased consumption. </p><p>The Grocery Goods Regulations, 2016, which were signed by my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, entered into force in April this year with the aim of improving the supply chain. </p></reply>

Earlier this year the Minister of State with special responsibility for horticulture, Andrew Doyle, T.D. issued approvals to 154 applicants with a total value of &euro;5.4m under the 2016 Round of the Scheme.  This will facilitate grower investment costing approximately &euro;13.5m over the coming months.   </p>  <p>  The EU funded Producer Organisation Scheme provides aid to encourage producers of fruit and vegetables to set up an organisation to jointly market their production in order to strengthen the producer&rsquo;s position in the marketplace.  The Scheme also aims to increase market orientation among EU growers, encourage innovation, promote fruit and vegetables, increase grower&rsquo;s competitiveness and improve marketing, product quality and the environmental aspects of production. </p>  <p>  A fruit or vegetable Producer Organisation may claim 50% EU aid on approved actions implemented through their Operational Programme up to a ceiling of 4.1% of their Value of Marketed Production, which is essentially their turnover. </p>  <p>  There are currently two recognised horticultural Producer Organisations in Ireland.

The terms and conditions for the Scheme set out a required group size of 12 &ndash; 18 participants and a maximum number of 5 groups per facilitator.  Maintaining the required group size and the maximum number of Knowledge Transfer Groups per facilitator is designed to underpin a more effective group interaction and to facilitate the delivery of the individualised Farm Improvement Plans which each farmer must develop with his facilitator as part of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  My officials have examined our records in relation to the group names provided, and I note that the facilitator in question has registered the maximum number of Knowledge Transfer Groups.

In order to definitively establish Entitlements for a farmer all their Transfer of Entitlement applications must be processed to completion.

At present, the species is firmly established throughout the river and navigation and there are no practical measures that can be taken to control or eradicate this species where it is already present in abundance.  I am also advised that it is established in both the Nore and Suir rivers. </p>  <p>  While dace is a valuable angling species for many anglers in certain freshwaters, including the River Barrow, it is acknowledged that the species can prove to be a nuisance to game anglers targeting brown trout and to a lesser extent salmon, and it is an invasive species in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The presence of dace in the Barrow system poses an increased risk of spread to interlinked waters and the primary approach of IFI in this regard is to prevent its spread outside of systems where it is already established, such as the Barrow.</p>  <p>  There is no eradication scheme in place as the fish is prolific and widespread.  There is currently no mechanism available that would enable the removal of the fish from the river without affecting other important species and communities.</p>  <p>  Under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations (2011), with regard to dace, a licence is required to breed, reproduce or release or allow or cause to disperse or escape from confinement, or for any person who has in his or her possession for sale, or for the purposes of breeding, reproduction or propagation, or offers or exposes for sale, transportation, distribution, introduction or release.</p></reply>

Decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, over &euro;4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.  In this context the Ardee bypass was one of the projects that it was not possible to include given the overall funding envelope available.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government proposes to undertake a Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan, which will take stock of progress and provide the Government with an opportunity to consider the scope for increased levels of investment, including in the transport sector, taking economic growth and fiscal progress into account.</p></reply>

The effect of the low proportion of WAVs in the overall small public service fleet has translated into major difficulties for wheelchair users to obtain transport.   </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has introduced a number of initiatives to address the shortfall in WAVs including the introduction of new regulations permitting smaller vehicles to be used as wheelchair accessible taxis and a grant scheme to assist in the purchase of suitable vehicles. </p>  <p>  I have referred your question to the NTA to provide some further detail on taxi licensing and the steps being taken to address the shortfall in WAVs.

This Programme also supports the other three regional airports in Counties Donegal, Mayo and Kerry with funding but only in relation to the implementation of necessary safety and security related projects and activities. </p><p>Development projects at the airports which are designed to expand capacity are a commercial matter for the airports themselves and are outside the scope of the Programme.  In the case of the proposed runway extension at Waterford, I understand that the airport authorities are pursuing local interests for funding in relation to that project.</p><p>The extra &euro;10 million in the Programme for Government is for capital funding and will enhance my Department's ability to further support safety and security related investments by the four regional airports.  This brings to &euro;38 million (was &euro;28m) the amount provided in the Capital Plan 2016-2022 for supporting the airports in these important areas and, as I said at the Select Committee last week, I would see these extra funds being allocated towards projects over that period, beginning in 2017.</p><p>For details of the grant support schemes under the current Regional Airports Programme, I previously referred the Deputy to my Department's website:  <i>.</i></p></reply>

The precise implications of the UK vote will now depend on the period of negotiation ahead, involving the UK and our EU partners.  The Government has undertaken careful planning in recent months for the contingency of this result.  We will now take this work forward to ensure that we respond appropriately and that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are represented fully in the negotiating process.   </p>  <p>  Following the announcement of the referendum result on Friday June 24th, as part of my own contingency plans, I instituted a Coordination Group consisting of the Chief Executive Officers of both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and relevant enterprise, single market, and trade officials, to oversee the management of our immediate response and the messaging to businesses both overseas and domestically.  I will continue to chair this Group as part my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response as developments unfold.  I have also met with the Director General and CEOs of IBEC, SFA, ISME, and the Irish Exporters Association, to hear at first hand the reactions and concerns of business.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have met with the British Irish Chamber of Commerce and will meet them again shortly.  Given the importance of the North-South economic relationship I am also meeting this week with Inter-Trade Ireland and recently met bilaterally with my Northern Ireland Counterpart and the Referendum result was discussed.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland, as the enterprise agency under the remit of my Department with responsibility for the development and growth of Irish enterprises in world markets, including many smaller businesses who trade between the UK and Ireland, has already put in place a dedicated team to address issues of concern to clients.  It has also provided a dedicated phone line and published an Information Guide for clients, detailing &lsquo;5 pillars of support&rsquo; and FAQs on its website.</p>  <p>  Since the referendum result on 24 June, Enterprise Ireland has:</p>  <p>  - Communicated with more than 1,500 clients who export to the UK, with a statement of reassurance and pointing them to the resources available.</p>  <p>  - Initiated direct engagement with clients most impacted (more than 200 to date) both in Ireland, and overseas, to hear their concerns.</p>  <p>  - Led a pro-active communications campaign in the national media, supporting Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ability to respond to client needs for information and assurance. </p>  <p>  The most immediate impact for Enterprise Ireland clients is currency fluctuation.  To address this, Enterprise Ireland have conducted a survey of clients exporting to the UK markets to ascertain their currency management status and developed a webinar, which is now live on the Enterprise Ireland website. </p>  <p>  This week, Enterprise Ireland will publish a new &lsquo;Guide to Exporting to the UK, post EU Referendum&rsquo; which will include expert advice and commentary as well as practical supports on LEAN business, business models, legal, tax, currency risk and supply chain management.</p>  <p>  In the period ahead, Enterprise Ireland will pursue a dual strategy of market diversification, beyond the UK markets, while at the same time, supporting Irish companies to maintain and grow existing exports in the UK market (&euro;7.5bn in 2015.) </p>  <p>  I have asked Enterprise Ireland to accelerate the finalisation of their plans for increasing the number of trade missions both within the EU, to include France, Germany and Scandinavia, and to intensify our programme of missions in non-EU markets.</p>  <p>  More generally, with trade in goods and services across the Irish sea amount to approx. &euro;1.2 bn per week, I will be lending my support to deepening bi-lateral trading relations, and in this regard I will lead a trade mission to the Farnborough International Air Show on 12/13 July.</p>  <p>  The network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), which are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business, will continue to provide assistance to the small business sector via their suite of support measures.</p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. </p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to supporting business in this period of heightened uncertainty and we will continue to work closely with the Department of the Taoiseach, the enterprise agencies and other Departments to monitor the impact of the UK referendum result both on indigenous and international companies. </p></reply>

This report indicated a strong on-going demand for people with high-level ICT skills across many sectors of the economy &ndash; not just the ICT sector itself.  The Export Group&rsquo;s report suggested that 44,500 new job openings could arise in Ireland from expansion and replacement demand over the period to 2018.</p><p>A main recommendation in the Expert Group&rsquo;s report was that the quantity and quality of ICT graduates should be boosted.  The report also recommended that enterprises should move further towards the development of experienced employees and providing career pathways for new graduate entrants. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s ICT Skills Action Plan provides an integrated education system response to increasing the supply of high-level ICT skills.  </p><p>The current Plan, which covers the period 2014-2018 focuses on actions under three Priority areas:</p><p>1. Increasing output of high-level graduates;</p><p>2. Enhancing ICT capacity and awareness in the education system; and</p><p>3. Ensuring Ireland maintains a strong ICT talent pool and promoting Ireland as a centre for high-level ICT Skills</p><p>Actions being taken to increase skills supply include the funding of additional places at Third Level, the provision of targeted reskilling/skills conversion opportunities, and marketing Ireland as a location of choice for international tech professionals looking to work on challenging and interesting projects. </p><p>The implementation of the ICT Skills Action Plan is driven by a High Level Steering Group under the auspices of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  The Steering Group includes industry representatives.  A key aspect of the success in progressing the ICT Skills Action Plan process to date has been the close engagement of industry with Government Departments and education and training providers. </p><p>The 2016 Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment to review the implementation of the ICT Skills Action Plan and identify additional measures that might be taken to boost the supply of skilled workers in this area.  My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Skills on this review. </p><p>The profile of the specific ICT/Tech occupations used in the EGFSN&rsquo;s previous work was derived from a special tabulation of occupational codes produced by the CSO from the Census 2011.</p><p>Similar findings from the Census 2016 will be valuable in updating this ICT/Tech occupational profiles information.</p></reply>

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open-up services market, and offer predictable conditions for investors.</p>  <p>  The EU-Canada Agreement will save on duty costs as 99.6% of all industrial tariffs will be eliminated on entry into force.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p>  <p>  In May this year, the Council had an exchange of views on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the process towards signature and provisional application of the agreement.  The European Commission and Member States highlighted the high quality of the agreement reached with Canada and expressed the desire to work towards signature of the agreement at the October EU-Canada Summit.  The Commission published their proposals for signature, conclusion and provisional application on 5 July 2016 which are available on the European Commission Register of Documents.  The proposal is for CETA to be a mixed agreement.</p>  <p>  At the last EU Council of Trade Ministers on 13 May 2016, I made Ireland&rsquo;s approach clear, that based on our current assessment of its provisions, we viewed CETA as a mixed Agreement, in terms of EU and Member State competency.  In view of the position taken by Ireland and other Member States I note that the Commission have now decided to submit CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement.  This means that each Member State will be required to ratify the agreement under its own procedures.  The Oireachtas will be part of the final decision on ratification.  It will now be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature, conclusion and provisional application of CETA.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the CETA on investment dispute resolution relate solely to the CETA as a multinational trade agreement.  Such trade agreements are not part of domestic law.  This is why separate adjudication arrangements are required in the event of disputes under the agreement.</p></reply>

IMR is an Enterprise Ireland/IDA Ireland Technology Centre focused on manufacturing and industrial energy efficiency research aimed at delivering solutions to manufacturing companies throughout Ireland.  The Centre offers the manufacturing industry a unique environment to collaborate with peer companies across all manufacturing sectors, and to inform and guide manufacturing research that can provide solutions to industry problems.</p>  <p>  I asked my officials to consult with Enterprise Ireland in relation to the grant assistance referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  My officials are advised there is no application for grant assistance pending for the Unit in question.  IMR receives the core of its funding from Enterprise Ireland (currently in the region of &euro;15 million over 5 years) but, like all Technology Centres, the Centre must also attract a portion of matching funding from industry and also from competitive research funding sources.  These additional funding sources ensure that Enterprise Ireland /IDA Ireland Technology Centres remain relevant to industry&rsquo;s needs while also being of a sufficient research &amp;amp; technological standard to win competitive funding.  The Mullingar based unit of this Technology Centre receives its funding from the central IMR budget where funding &amp;amp; governance decisions are made by its Board, which is predominantly comprised of industry representatives.</p></reply>

This approach was agreed by the three Government Departments involved in the development of the model and remains the policy position.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that all local services provided by or on behalf of the HSE have been issued with an instruction from HSE senior management that existing supports are not to be withdrawn from children with a disability until AIM is fully embedded.
