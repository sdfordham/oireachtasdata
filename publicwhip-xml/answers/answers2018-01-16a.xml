While the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has overall responsibility for the National Broadband Plan, my Department is working closely with Local Authorities and other relevant bodies to prepare for the roll out of high speed broadband by identifying and resolving any local issues that might impact on the delivery of the necessary infrastructure.  </p><p>My Department, through Minister Kyne, also co-chairs an Implementation Group with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Denis Naughten, to oversee 40 actions arising from the report of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce aimed at improving broadband and mobile phone coverage in the short-term.  Quarterly Progress Reports on the Implementation Group's work are available on my Department's website.</p><p>The revitalisation of our rural towns and villages is also a key objective of the Action Plan for Rural Development.  My Department has a number of initiatives in place which support this objective, including the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the CL&Aacute;R Programme and the TidyTowns competition.</p><p>Since the launch of the Action Plan in January 2017 I have funded a wide range of projects under these initiatives, including 281 projects under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, with a total investment of &euro;21.6 million being made over the next 15 months.  The CL&Aacute;R programme provided funding of &euro;7 million in 2017 for 231 projects, while I allocated &euro;1.4 million to TidyTowns Committees throughout the country to mark the 60<sup>th</sup>anniversary of the competition in 2018.</p><p>The second half-yearly Progress Report on the implementation of all of the measures in the Action Plan for Rural Development is currently being prepared by my Department and will be published shortly.</p></reply>

This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.</p><p>I am confident that progress now being made by the Local Action Groups, along with the administrative improvements I made to the programme in 2017, will result in a continued increase in project approvals and substantial payments under the LEADER programme across all sub-regional areas over the coming months.</p></reply>

The Control of Dogs Act 1986 outlines requirements regarding the need to hold dog licences, and outlines the penalties for non-compliance.  Given the requirements and the strict penal provisions for non-compliance that are already in place, I have no plans to amend the Control of Dogs Acts in respect of the requirement to hold dog licences.</p>  <p>  Under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, 2010, local authorities are responsible for the registration, inspection and regulation of dog breeding establishments within their areas.  A public consultation process on the Dog Breeding Establishment Guidelines took place in 2017.  The Department has completed its review of the submissions received and a draft final report is under consideration with a view to publication in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the plans announced by the UK Government to bring forward proposals for draft regulations relating to the licensing of dog-breeding and other animal-related businesses in England.  This is the latest stage of a review process which began in the Summer of 2015.  While the legislative framework in this country is different, I will have regard to the proposals being considered in the UK when considering possible next steps.</p></reply>

Tender results issued to all bidders on 24<sup>th</sup>November last. </p><p>The national annual budget allocation for the SICAP programme in 2018 is just over &euro;38million. The programme has commenced in 47 of the 51 Lot areas. In four Lot areas, no tender was awarded and a negotiated procedure is now underway in each of the areas between the relevant LCDC and the Programme Implementer.</p><p>In areas where a negotiated process is taking place, my Department has extended the previous SICAP contract with the LCDC for a period of 3 months from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2018.  The LCDCs are similarly extending their contracts with the existing Programme Implementers. This will ensure service delivery in the relevant areas is not affected. During this period funding for the contract extension will be provided based on the 2017 allocation for those Lot areas.</p></reply>

Over the same period, outflows from the Fund totalled just over &euro;140 million. </p>  <p>  The impact of these inflows and outflows was a net increase of &euro;116 million in inflows to the Dormant Accounts Fund over the period 2012 to 2016. This equates to an average increase of &euro;23 million per annum in inflows over the five year period. </p>  <p>  The net value of uncommitted Dormant Accounts funds stood at &euro;124.8 million at the end of September 2017, exclusive of a reserve for potential claims on the Fund by account holders, and commitments yet to be disbursed by the NTMA on foot of approvals to projects and programmes. </p>  <p>  The legislation governing the Dormant Accounts Funds provides the framework for the disbursement of funds to measures solely targeted at socially, economically and educationally disadvantage people, and persons with a disability. The funding is allocated through a Disbursement Scheme, underpinned by annual Action Plans which set out specific programmes to be funded each year.  </p>  <p>  The 2017 Action Plan allocated funding of &euro;40.4 million to 40 measures across a range of Government Departments and agencies. The Action Plan is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  My Department will soon begin the preparation of a Dormant Accounts Action Plan for 2018 and will invite Departments to submit proposals for inclusion in the Plan.  I will also be seeking an update on the balance in the Fund at the end of 2017 from the NTMA.</p></reply>

In addition, I am advised that there have been a number of familiarisation meetings between senior officials in the Department and their counterparts in the Authority. As part of the Department's oversight role, there are also scheduled governance meetings between the Chief Executive Officer and senior officials in my Department.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the Charities Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;the Charities Regulator&rdquo;) was established on 16 October, 2014 pursuant to the Charities Act 2009. The Regulator is the State organisation responsible for registering and regulating all of Ireland&rsquo;s charities. The Charities Regulator is independent in the performance of its statutory functions.</p>  <p>  Regulation of the charity sector is essential to enhance public trust and confidence in the governance, management and administration of charities in this country and to guard against exploitation of charitable causes by unscrupulous, unprincipled or unethical individuals. Better oversight of charities will secure the future of the charity sector which plays a key role in our civil society and helps to create and maintain vibrant communities.</p>  <p>  Prior to the final delegation of functions at the Department I attended, with Minister Michael Ring, the launch of fundraising guidelines for charities. These guidelines aim to protect charities and promote public confidence in the organisations.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to investigate the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks.</p>  <p>  A project team comprising officials from my Department and the Department of Finance was established last year to progress this commitment.  The project team carried out detailed research into the concept of a public banking model, with a particular focus on the Sparkassen model. In addition, a public consultation process, seeking views on the concept of a community banking model, ran for four weeks. A total of 16 replies from a range of stakeholders was received.</p>  <p>  As part of their research, officials from both Government Departments met with representatives of the organisations referred to in the Deputy's question. The organisations in question put forward a proposal as to how a local public bank, based on the Sparkassen model, could work in Ireland.  An invitation was extended to Irish officials to visit Germany to examine the public banking network there. However, the level of information provided by the organisations in their meetings with officials was sufficiently comprehensive to explain the model.  </p>  <p>  The Departmental officials have now finalised their report and have submitted their findings to the Minister for Finance and myself. The report will be brought to Government shortly for consideration.</p></reply>

It remains the main social inclusion programme of Government supporting local community groups and individuals such as low income workers, young people not in education, employment or training, or who live in disadvantaged areas, through community development approaches to become less socially excluded. SICAP worked with 47,000 individuals in 2016, many of whom increased their work-readiness, received help in accessing employment or self-employment, or who received support to access a life-long-learning opportunity.</p>  <p>  SICAP 2018-2022 was designed to reflect government policy and priorities, Ireland&rsquo;s changing social and economic landscape, and learning from the previous iteration of the Programme including the findings from an extensive consultation process, led out on by Minister Catherine Byrne, that was held in 2017, and also by the provisional findings from a series of evaluations by the ESRI on particular components of SICAP. </p>  <p>  The next 6-monthly Progress Report on the implementation of the Action Plan will be published in February and I look forward to working with rural communities and our colleagues in other Government Departments and State agencies in continuing to drive the rural development agenda in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Community Services Programme, which was transferred to my Department on 1 January, supports community organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through the application of a social enterprise model of delivery. One of the objectives of this Programme is to create sustainable jobs for those most distant from the labour market, in particular for those who are long term unemployed and from specific target groups.  Some 425 contracts are in place with service providers nationally. The 2018 budget for the programme is &euro;46.3m.</p></reply>

The scheme&rsquo;s objective is to provide multi-annual funding towards core costs of national organisations, focussed on organisations supporting disadvantage. Under a three-year funding programme which commenced in 2016, my Department will allocate &euro;5.921m to the SSNO in 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department also supports volunteer centres and volunteer information services nationwide, as well as a number of national organisations such as Volunteer Ireland and Young Social Innovators.  The funding of these organisations is designed to strengthen and foster volunteerism in Ireland, building a support structure for volunteering locally from the bottom up. This is key to the Department&rsquo;s citizen engagement objectives and supports the spirit of participation in communities. A total of &euro;3.5m was allocated to these organisations in 2017 and a similar amount will be available in 2018.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department supports Public Participation Networks (PPN) which have now been established in each local authority area. PPNs aim to enable the public to take an active formal role in relevant policy making and oversight committees of the local authority.  Since 2015, funding of up to &euro;50,000 has been provided by my Department to each PPN, with supplementary funding being provided by local authorities. Similar funding arrangements will continue in 2018 to support PPNs in terms of their continued operation and development.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to members of the Community and Voluntary Pillar to allow for input into the policy making process within the community and voluntary sector. This year my Department will allocate &euro;0.565m to the Pillar. </p>  <p>  Finally the Deputy will be aware that I launched a revised Seniors Alert Scheme last October. The objective of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to encourage community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, as a result of the revised scheme and a widespread publicity campaign, there has been a significant uptake by the targeted group. My Department will allocate &euro;2.3m to the scheme in 2018. </p></reply>

This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.</p>  <p>  I am confident that progress now being made by the Local Action Groups, along with the administrative improvements I made to the programme in 2017, will result in a continued increase in project approvals and substantial payments under the LEADER programme across all sub-regional areas over the coming months.</p></reply>

It is only when monies are expended on dormant accounts measures that Departments can seek reimbursement from the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p></reply>

This included engagement with PDFORRA and RACO through the Permanent Defence Force Conciliation and Arbitration machinery, as well as consultations and meetings directly with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p>  <p>   The Representative Associations made written and oral submissions on their particular concerns around the Single Scheme Bill.  However, at no stage prior to 2013 was the question of &lsquo;supplementary pension&rsquo; cover for Single Scheme new entrants raised by the Representative Side as an issue or concern.  The matter has subsequently been the subject of extensive discussions and correspondence with the Representative Associations.</p>  <p>  A claim for payment of the Supplementary pension to new entrants post 1 January 2013 has been received under the Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under the CandA scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time.</p></reply>

As the projects will relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations, such costs would be incurred in the normal course and will therefore be met from within the Defence Vote.  It is expected that sharing the costs of capability development across a number of member States should prove cost neutral in terms of overall projected defence expenditure.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that there is no requirement on Ireland or any other EU member State to achieve any specific target in relation to Defence expenditure, nor is there any agreement at EU level in this regard.  The Deputy will be aware that the Lisbon Treaty explicitly provides that it is entirely a matter for Ireland, or any other Member State, to determine the nature and volume of its own defence and security expenditure, as well as the nature of its defence capabilities. </p>  <p>  I have made arrangements for the key PESCO documents to be lodged in the D&aacute;il Library, as follows:</p>  <p>  - PESCO Notification as signed by Member States on 13 November 2017</p>  <p>  - Irelands Notification Letter of 07 December 2017 and,</p>  <p>  - Council Decision of 08 December 2017 establishing Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and determining the list of Participating Member States.</p>  <p>  I will update the House on continuing developments on CSDP in the normal course, including in respect of Ireland's participation in PESCO.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar T.D., is actively engaged in this process and has already contributed to discussions on education and culture, migration and completion of economic and monetary union.  An informal meeting in February under the &lsquo;Leaders&rsquo; Agenda&rsquo; will look at institutional issues and the political priorities for the multi-annual financial framework.  When the Taoiseach addresses the European Parliament in Strasbourg tomorrow he will be the first Head of Government to participate in a series of debates there on the future of Europe.</p>  <p>  In November I joined the Taoiseach and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Helen McEntee T.D., in launching a citizens&rsquo; dialogue on the future of Europe and the Minister of State is currently taking this initiative forward with a series of regional consultations.</p>  <p>  As the deputy may be aware, I set out the Government&rsquo;s views on the future of Europe in a comprehensive address, &lsquo;The Europe We Want,&rsquo; at UCD on 29 November.</p></reply>

I welcomed this news and expressed my hope that discussions on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship, and on transitional arrangements, would begin as soon as possible, as they are hugely important both for Ireland and for the EU as a whole.</p>  <p>  We spoke in detail on the Irish specific issues and I thanked him for his continued support for Ireland and the unique challenges that we face in the context of Brexit.  I welcomed the text of the joint progress report on Ireland and Northern Ireland as it reflects our goals of maintaining the Common Travel Area, protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including North South cooperation and the rights enshrined in the Agreement, and protecting the gains of the peace process, most notably guarantees on avoiding a hard border.  We agreed that there is clearly still a great deal of work remaining on the Irish specific issues to ensure that all the commitments set out in this report are implemented and to that end I welcomed that this work will continue to be taken forward in a distinct strand of the negotiations in phase two.  Our Permanent Representation in Brussels, my officials and I will remain in regular contact with Mr Barnier and his Taskforce to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests continue to be advanced in the EU&rsquo;s position as the negotiations move to phase two.</p></reply>

I urge the Government of Colombia to ensure that all incidents, including those referred to by the Deputy, are thoroughly investigated and their perpetrators brought to justice.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has an ongoing commitment to support peace and human rights in Colombia.  As well as exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government level, officials of the Department engage with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active across Colombia, including those working in communities most impacted by the conflict. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides funding directly to the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights in Colombia to support its work in promoting and protecting human rights, including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, as well as to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, which provides protection measures to community leaders and activists operating in Colombia. </p>  <p>  Officials from the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia, frequently visit the country and maintain regular contact with partners there, including to receive updates on the violence affecting communities. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in October 2017 I announced Ireland&rsquo;s intention to open an embassy in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia.  This will be a very positive development in Ireland-Colombia relations and clearly demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to supporting peace and human rights in Colombia and the full implementation of the country&rsquo;s peace accord. </p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Historic strides have been made to date in its implementation, including the full decommissioning of FARC weapons by July 2017 and the transformation of the organisation into a political party.  </p>  <p>  However, as we know from our own experience, achieving peace can be complex and challenging and is far from straightforward.  Ireland remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the agreement, which will ensure the eradication of violence in vulnerable communities and a more peaceful future for all Colombians.</p></reply>

Irish Government contributions to the Green Climate Fund falls under the remit of the Department for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.</p>  <p>  In addition to Irish Government funding to the Green Climate Fund, Irish Aid, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, funds climate adaptation and mitigation activities in some of the least developed countries, those often most impacted by the devastating effects of climate change.  This funding consists of contributions to multilateral organisations, grants to NGOs, and programmes implemented through our Embassies.</p>  <p>  We rigorously track our climate finance expenditure and report annually to the UN on our commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  In 2016, Ireland was voted by Adaptation Watch the second most transparent donor in its reporting of climate finance. </p>  <p>  That year, we provided &euro;50.6m in climate finance as part of our Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) programme.  The vast majority of these funds went to support adaptation to climate change in least developed countries, focusing on smallholder agriculture, social protection, reducing the risks of natural disasters, and the impact of climate change on women. </p>  <p>  Under the Paris Agreement, Irish Aid also directly supports the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Ireland has committed to providing &euro;1 million per annum to the LDCF, and &euro;500,000 per annum to the LEG, for the 2016-18 period.

I also met with the Secretary General of the Arab League, Mr. Aboul Gheit, to discuss the Middle East Peace Process and regional conflicts including Syria and Yemen.  Finally, I met with the President of Egypt&rsquo;s National Council for Women, and with leaders in the business community.</p>  <p>  In my second trip to Israel and Palestine as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I met with key representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as leaders of other Israeli political parties, and partners in international and non-governmental organisations.  In all of these meetings I conveyed the importance the Irish people attach to the resolution of the Middle East Peace Process, something that has been a priority for me personally since I took office.</p>  <p>  In my meetings with the Israeli authorities, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of the continuing occupation, including settlement construction and the effects on minors who are detained.  I had a frank discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu about the prospects for returning to negotiations between the parties, and how Ireland and the EU can play a constructive role in the MEPP.  I set out the urgent need to break the downward spiral of the situation in Gaza, which is clearly unsustainable, and talked about ways in which it could be alleviated.  I put on record my view that to bar individuals from Israel, on the basis that they hold views critical of the Government's policies, is not the way to deal with criticism.</p>  <p>  I also had the opportunity to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and Foreign Minister Malki, with whom I discussed the challenges facing the Palestinian people, and the prospects for reinvigorating the effort towards peace in the Middle East.  They set out their thinking on ways to prepare for a Palestinian State.  I also heard about work to restore the Palestinian Authority to its role in Gaza, giving Palestinians a unified Government, an effort that I encouraged and supported.</p>  <p>  In Gaza, I met with Palestinian Authority officials, officials from UNRWA and the OHCHR, as well as representatives of civil society organisations.  I saw at first hand the effects of the blockade, and the effects that this is having on young people's prospects and hopes, leading to a dangerous sense of despair.  I reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to working to end this situation. </p></reply>

However, devolved power-sharing government can only operate on the basis of an agreement reached between the two largest parties, while the other parties represented in the Assembly also have a critical role to play here.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that, after several phases of negotiations in different formats, we still do not have an agreement to form an Executive.  The issues under discussion go to the heart of the divisions in society in Northern Ireland and agreement on them was always going to be challenging.  However, I have always believed that it is possible to reach an agreed outcome which ensures implementation of previous agreements and reflects the core principles of the Good Friday Agreement and power-sharing itself - partnership, equality, and mutual respect.</p>  <p>  Important progress has been made over the past number of months and I believe that the prize of devolved power-sharing government is achievable and can be secured for the benefit of all of the people of Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I met with the newly appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, in London on 12 January.  We discussed how both Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, can support the parties in resolving the outstanding issues and moving ahead to form a new Executive.  </p>  <p>  The Secretary of State and I agreed that there remain challenges for the parties in reaching that agreement, but we also noted the wish of each of the parties to see the devolved power-sharing institutions continuing to operate.</p>  <p>  Both Governments remain strongly committed to ensuring that all possible efforts are made in the period ahead to support a move forward by the parties that will ensure the continuation of devolved power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.  I will meet with Secretary of State Bradley again later this week, to discuss the further engagement by both Governments to this end. </p>  <p>  The Government has consistently affirmed our unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and our determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  The Executive and Assembly are at the heart of the Agreement, and it is imperative that they operate to deliver representative and accountable government in Northern Ireland, in accordance with the principles of partnership, parity of esteem and mutual respect.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I will continue to engage with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland in the period immediately ahead to support the urgent formation of a new Executive by the mandated political parties.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s candidacy was announced in 2005.</p>  <p>  The UN provides the foundation of an orderly, rules-based international system, which is essential for a small and globally trading country like Ireland.  We have a responsibility to participate to the fullest extent possible in the work of the UN, and to champion its role and values.</p>  <p>  Ireland is competing with Norway and Canada for one of two seats in what is likely to be a very tightly fought election.  Both countries have, like Ireland, strong records of engagement at the UN. In order to be elected to the Security Council, Ireland will need to secure the support of two-thirds of the UN membership &ndash; approximately 129 votes of the 193 Member States.</p>  <p>  The campaign leading up to 2020 is already well under way.  While I cannot provide specific details on sensitive bilateral contacts which are being made in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s Security Council candidature, I am using every opportunity to press the value of Ireland playing our role on the Council.  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s diplomatic staff in Ireland, our Permanent Representation to the UN in New York, and our entire Embassy network have been actively presenting our case and seeking support. </p>  <p>  This week my Department is convening a Heads of Mission conference, which will see Ambassadors and senior diplomats from across our Mission network return to Dublin to discuss foreign policy priorities for the period ahead.  The Security Council candidature will permeate all aspects of our discussions, setting the agenda for 2018 and beyond.   </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s previous terms on the Security Council have provided an opportunity to give firm practical expression to the principles underlying Irish foreign policy, principles which are widely held across the Oireachtas.  A strong and vigorous effort will be needed to secure election in 2020, and this is the objective of the campaign.  Should we succeed, our election will allow Ireland to again bring our values of peace, justice and human rights to bear in directing the work of the Security Council. </p></reply>

The first, also involving Poland and the Czech Republic, relates to the mandatory relocation issue and the failure to take refugees in accordance with the September 2015 Justice and Home Affairs Council Decision.  The other two referrals relate to the laws on higher education (the &ldquo;Lex CEU&rdquo;) and on NGOs adopted in 2017.  In the case of these latter two issues, Hungary is considered to have failed to address EU concerns about these laws or amend the legislation to bring it in line with EU standards.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach also raised concerns over rule of law issues with Prime Minister Orban during their meeting on 4 January last.</p>  <p>  It is my hope that Hungary and the European Commission will engage on these important issues and that, ultimately, a resolution may be achieved.</p></reply>

The Commission has also said that it is ready to pursue a constructive dialogue with the Polish Government to this end.</p>  <p>  Commission President Juncker and Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki met in Brussels on 9 January last where they addressed a broad range of issues of common interest, including the Rule of Law.

The conflict, which is now almost eight years old, has cost an estimated half a million lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. Over 5.5 million have fled to neighboring countries and the wider region.  An end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.The UN is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for an end to violence; release of political prisoners; formation of a transitional governing body with executive powers and a constitutional reform process. The eighth round of these talks is currently underway in Geneva. Ireland fully supports this process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura.   The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.  The EU Syria Peace Process Support Initiative aims to facilitate the peace process, build the capacity of opposition parties and contribute to dialogue with civil society in support of the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Syria.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU also provide support, including financial support, to a broad range of mechanisms to ensure legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria as part of a sustainable peaceful resolution to the conflict. </p>  <p>  Since 2012 Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the international humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017.  This is our largest contribution to a single crisis in recent years. Through our annual contributions to the EU institutions Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the crisis.  The EU and its Member States have together mobilised more than &euro;9.5 billion for humanitarian and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. The EU will host a donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in 2018. </p></reply>

Our policy for International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as economic conditions allow.  The current Programme for Government reinforces this commitment.</p>  <p>  The international development context has evolved significantly over the past five years. As announced by the T&aacute;naiste we will produce a new White Paper on international development policy in 2018.  The White Paper will build on our existing aid programme and allow us to take stock of the implications of a fast-changing global environment and prioritise our role in fulfilling the ambitious international development policy agenda.</p>  <p>  Progress towards achieving the 0.7% UN target needs to be made in a sustainable and manageable way.  This will build on Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in contributing to ending global poverty and hunger, and in providing humanitarian assistance.   Reaching this target will involve significant increases to the ODA budget and requires careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The new White Paper on Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance programme will inform an ambitious pathway towards making greater but sustainable progress on the UN target. Internal preparations and analysis are already underway. Internal and external stakeholders will be involved in a consultation process following DPER guidelines. The White Paper will also build on the independent work of the review of the Irish Aid programme currently being undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs and Trade (JCFAT).</p></reply>

In this capacity, I am working closely with colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit. This cooperation also involves the relevant State Agencies.   Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios, including one in which no Withdrawal Agreement is concluded.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s previous contingency planning.  </p>  <p>  Aside from its wider co-ordination responsibilities, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has lead responsibility for planning for, preparing positions on, and following the EU-UK negotiations.  This requires research on and analysis of very many legal, institutional, and political issues, the eventual outcome of negotiations on which will of course be decisive in determining the shape and effects of Brexit.  This work is led by the European Union Division in co-operation with the Ireland and United Kingdom and Americas Division, the Legal Division, the Political Division and the Trade Division. Our Permanent Representation in Brussels, and our Embassies in all Member States, send in a constant stream of reports describing and analysing the concerns and priorities of the EU Institutions and our partners.</p>  <p>  This work is reflected in the Government&rsquo;s policy positions and public statements but it would not be helpful or appropriate to publish detailed material which is heavily informed by confidential discussions with other Member States and the EU Institutions. </p>  <p>  The Department is also analysing the possible impact of Brexit on policy areas within its remit, notably the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and the EU&rsquo;s policy on international development.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the European Commission and European Parliament Offices here in Dublin and with civil society organisations including the Institute for International and European Affairs and European Movement Ireland.  With funding from this Department, the IIEA is undertaking research on the future shape of the EU and the new strategic alliances that Ireland will need to develop within the EU after Brexit.  The analysis will also consider the macro-economic effects of Brexit and the EU institutional implications of Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. This work will build on the extensive analysis being undertaken by a range of organisations, both in Ireland and further afield, and will be presented in a series of public research papers over the coming months and years.</p></reply>

These include to ensure the efficient delivery of passport and consular services to our citizens, support to emigrant organisations and outreach to the diaspora and other networks of influence.  Our Embassies and Consulates are contributing directly to safeguarding our interests in negotiations on the UK exit from the European Union and they are helping to ensure that Ireland plays a full part in shaping the future development of the European Union.  The work of my Department in promoting a more just, fair, secure and sustainable world continues through mission engagement with multilateral institutions and agencies, including those of the United Nations, and via implementation of the Irish Aid programme in partner countries.

Based on current estimates, it is anticipated this level of allocation will see ODA amount to approximately 0.3% of GNI in 2018.  The current Programme for Government sets out our ambition to meet the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as resources permit.  The intention is to reach the target by 2030, the timeframe for UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Progress towards the 0.7% target will need to be made in a sustainable and manageable way, building on Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in combatting global poverty and hunger, and in providing humanitarian assistance.  In order to prepare that managed progression towards the UN target, a new White Paper on Irish overseas development assistance will be produced this year.  Reaching the 0.7% target will involve significant increases to the ODA budget.  Where these increases might be best focused and how they can be managed prudentially and effectively will require careful planning and consultation, including with other Government Departments and stakeholders more generally.  The White Paper process will give direction in this regard, as will the current work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence looking at Irish Aid.</p><p>The following table sets out a sample stepped scenario for meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2030, with interim targets of 0.4% in 2022, 0.5% in 2026 and 0.6% in 2028. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Total ODA In &euro; millions</th><th>ODA as a % of Projected GNP</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>707.10</td><td>0.30%</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>906.37</td><td>0.35%</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>1,109.29</td><td>0.40%</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>1,323.96</td><td>0.45%</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>1,560.65</td><td>0.50%</td></tr><tr><td>2028</td><td>1,986.83</td><td>0.60%</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>2,459.13</td><td>0.70%</td></tr></table>As GNI is calculated in arrears, forecasts for Gross National Product (GNP) are used as a proxy for GNI in the above calculations.</p></reply>

This Trust Fund was launched at the EU-Africa Summit on migration in Valletta, Malta, on 11-12 November 2015 and will operate until 2020.  Almost &euro;3.2 billion has been pledged for the Trust Fund by the EU and EU Member States. </p><p>At the time of its launch, Ireland made a commitment to provide a bilateral contribution of &euro;3 million over the period covered by the Trust Fund, 2016 to 2020 (&euro;600,000 per annum).  This commitment is earmarked for the Horn of Africa region. </p><p>At the meeting of the European Council of 19-20 October 2017, and in response to a call by President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, for further pledges to meet pressing needs, the Taoiseach pledged additional bilateral Irish funding of &euro;3 million by 2020, doubling Ireland&rsquo;s total commitment to the Trust Fund. </p><p>To date, Ireland has provided &euro;600,000 to the Trust Fund in 2016, &euro;600,000 in early 2017, and a further &euro;400,000 in December 2017 in line with the additional pledge. Ireland&rsquo;s total bilateral contribution to the Trust Fund to date therefore stands at &euro;1.6 million.  A further &euro;1 million will be provided in 2018, with the remaining balance of &euro;3.4 million to be disbursed over 2019 and 2020. </p><p>Ireland also makes an assessed contribution, along with other EU Member States, to the European Development Fund (EDF) which in turn supports the Trust Fund (&euro;2.29 billion pledged by EDF). </p><p>Incremental increases of the type set out in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are not planned.</p></reply>

In addition, the Passport Service has received sanction for 210 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) this year to respond the seasonal demand for passports, which is normally between February and September annually.  All sections in the Passport Service are monitored closely to ensure they are sufficiently resourced to meet demand.    The number of these Passport Service staff working on the online passport application service varies depending on the volume in the system.  The Deputy should be aware, however, that in addition to the team processing these applications, staff assigned to other duties such as those in the Communications Unit deal with queries arising in connection with all passport applications, including queries from online passport applicants.  The cost of running the Passport Service in 2017 was &euro;33.7 million.  This figure excludes accommodation costs as any properties occupied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the State are rented and maintained by the Office of Public Works.

These Guidelines welcomed the joint progress report agreed between the European Commission Taskforce and the UK. On this basis, it was agreed that sufficient progress has been made in phase 1 of the negotiations and that the negotiations can move to phase 2.  In phase 2, a Withdrawal Agreement covering the issues addressed in phase I will be negotiated.  The aim is that this agreement will include provision for transitional arrangements, discussions on which are to begin shortly.  The framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK will also start to be discussed in a few months.   As concerns the exit issues, I welcome that the Guidelines underline that negotiations in phase two can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible.  This includes the commitments on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and avoiding a hard border, as well as on maintaining the Common Travel Area.  A key focus in the coming weeks and months will therefore be on completing work on the withdrawal issues and on drafting the relevant parts of the Withdrawal Agreement.  It will also be important to maintain a clear focus on the unique challenges faced by Ireland and I welcome that all aspects of the Irish specific issues will continue to be worked on in a distinct stream of work in phase 2.</p>  <p>  As concerns transitional arrangements, I welcome that these have been identified as an early priority in phase 2 and that the European Commission Taskforce proposed additional negotiating Directives on transitional arrangements on 20 December.  These draft Directives, which propose a &lsquo;status-quo&rsquo; transitional arrangement, are currently being discussed by the EU27 Member States with a view to their agreement later this month at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50).  Once these additional negotiating directives are agreed by the Council, the Commission will be in a position to begin negotiations with the UK on this issue.</p>  <p>  In the Guidelines of 15 December, the European Council also invited the Commission and the Council to continue preparations for the negotiations on the framework for the EU-UK future relationship with a view to agreeing additional Guidelines at the European Council on 22-23 March 2018.  In this regard, I welcome that the Guidelines reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s desire to establish a close partnership with the UK.  This is in line with Ireland&rsquo;s objective of having the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade.  It is now important for the UK to provide further clarity on what it wants for the future relationship with the EU.  The EU remains open to all options, in line with the principles agreed by the European Council.</p>  <p>  In the coming weeks and months, Ireland will continue to work closely with its EU partners and the European Commission Task Force, and with the UK, to ensure the commitments made in phase one are delivered in full and that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are advanced in the EU&rsquo;s position for the negotiations on transitional arrangements and the future relationship.</p></reply>

I firmly believe that such an approach is counter-productive, and that it will not help to increase ordinary Israelis' understanding of the sound basis for international concern about the impact of occupation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the decision taken by Israel to exclude members of certain groups, I believe that this action also does not help to build a better mutual understanding or to move the situation forward.</p>  <p>  Israel is of course entitled to decide who it allows into its territory, as is any other state.  However, I believe that excluding people simply for critical opinions they hold is not the usual practice of a democracy. Moreover, such exclusions also have the effect of denying people access to the occupied Palestinian territory which Israel controls.  While the Government does not support a policy of &ldquo;Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions&rdquo;, it is a legitimate and non-violent political viewpoint, albeit one regarded in Israel as hostile.</p>  <p>  During my visit to the Middle East last week, I raised this issue directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu.  I told him that I believe it is counterproductive and mistaken to exclude, from Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, individuals belonging to groups which have a deep interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Doctor Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p>  <p>  The previous Minister for Finance subsequently proposed to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement meant that home owners were not faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Doctor Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the Government. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gave effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Doctor Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  I have stated consistently that my Department will consider issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Thornhill Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline. The Government will make its position clear so that households will know well advance what its plans are for LPT.  In that regard, I consider it very important that the principle that formed a central part of the terms of reference for the 2015 review of LPT i.e., achieving relative stability in LPT payments of liable persons both over the short and longer terms, will inform our consideration of this matter.</p>  <p>  My Department will advance work on this matter in 2018 in conjunction with the Departments of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government and the Revenue Commissioners.  This review will involve a public consultation so that the views of all interested individuals and parties can be elicited.</p></reply>

The State Pension (Contributory) is based on social insurance contributions paid or credited over the course of a person&rsquo;s working life.  The State Pension (Non-Contributory) is a means tested payment.  The State Pension (Contributory) has six payment bands ranging from &euro;95.20 for those with an average of 10-14 contributions, up to &euro;238.30 for this with an average of 48 or more contributions.  The State Pension (Non-Contributory) payments start at &euro;2.50 and rise incrementally up to a maximum of &euro;227 per week (for those with weekly assessed means of less than &euro;30).  Individuals are paid whichever of the two potential pension payments is most beneficial to them (gross).</p>  <p>  Pensioners can also apply for an increased payment in respect of a qualified adult (IQA) (i.e. an adult that is dependent on their income such as, for example, a dependant spouse).  The IQA payment is means tested and can be paid directly to the Qualified Adult.  The maximum amount payable to a Qualified Adult under the age of 66 is &euro;158.80 (when related to State Pension (contributory) or &euro;150 (when related to State Pension (non-contributory).  When the Qualified Adult reaches pension age, he/she can apply for both available pensions in his/her own right, or continue to be classed as a qualified adult for the purposes of an IQA payment from the spouse&rsquo;s pension.  That over-66 IQA payment has a maximum rate of &euro;213.50.  Once more, the person is paid whatever payment is most beneficial to them (gross).</p>  <p>  With regard to the taxation of these payments, the State Pension, including an increase to that pension in respect of a qualifying adult dependent, is chargeable to income tax.  </p>  <p>  Where an individual in a married couple is entitled to the State Pension and such pension is increased in respect of a qualifying adult dependant, Section 126(2B) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that it remains one pension for tax purposes and the individual claiming the pension is chargeable to tax on it.   The individual is entitled to a PAYE tax credit of &euro;1,650 to be set against his or her tax liabilities, in addition to the married personal tax credit of &euro;3,300.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, where a married couple are in receipt of two separate and distinct social welfare pensions, each spouse is chargeable to income tax in respect of their respective pension and each spouse is entitled to a PAYE tax credit of &euro;1,650 in addition to the couple being entitled to the married personal tax credit of &euro;3,300.  The total value of tax credits available to a couple where both individuals has pension income in his/her own right therefore exceeds the total value of the credits available to a couple with only one source of pension income (such as a State Pension with IQA).</p>  <p>  It is assumed that the individuals in question switched from a single payment with an adult dependant to individual pension claims in order to receive an increased gross pension payment. Having regard to the tax credits set out above, the circumstances set out in the question whereby a net decrease in income has occurred should not, in general, arise in practice.  If the Deputy is aware of a couple that have identified what appears to be an anomaly in their tax affairs they should be advised to contact Revenue to have their tax affairs reviewed.</p>  <p>  Many factors determine the tax position of any individual or couple including, for example, the receipt of additional incomes or an entitlement to additional tax credits due to particular circumstances.  While any increase in income may lead to an increased tax liability, the structure of the income tax systems and the rates of charge are such that an increase in gross income should not, generally, lead to a decrease in net income.</p></reply>

Instead NAMA acquired loans and its role is as a secured lender.  The property itself continues to be owned and managed by the property owner, or receiver where one has been appointed.  Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009 preclude NAMA from disclosing information relating to NAMA debtors, their finances and their property.  As such, NAMA cannot publish information relating to debtor-managed properties and the NAMA website therefore does not include information relating to such properties.  The Deputy will be aware that sales of NAMA-secured properties are conducted according to NAMA&rsquo;s open marketing guidelines, with the property owner or receiver, not NAMA, managing the sales process.</p>  <p>  With regard to receiver-managed properties, because certain information relating to the receivership is publicly available, this allows NAMA to publish details of these properties on the NAMA website.  The information available includes the location of the particular property and contact information for the receiver&rsquo;s office.  Where a property is for sale, contact information for the sales agent is also included. </p>  <p>  Currently there are 428 entries on the NAMA website of receiver-managed assets in Ireland which are not yet for sale but which are likely to be offered for sale in the future.  In addition, there are 112 entries which relate to receiver-managed assets which are currently for sale.  I am advised that each entry may consist of multiple properties. If a NAMA-secured property is not for sale, this is due to the strategy adopted by the receiver or property owner in order to maximise the return for the asset and also to ensure that NAMA obtains the best achievable financial return for the State, as required under Section 10 of the NAMA Act. </p>  <p>  The most recent details for NAMA's remaining portfolio are available in the Agency's quarterly section 55 accounts for Q2 of 2017.  This report is publicly available under the Publications section of the NAMA website and outlines that the carrying value of NAMA&rsquo;s loan portfolio at 30 June 2017, net of cumulative impairment, was &euro;3.7 billion.  I am advised that the intention of the Agency is to continue the deleveraging of the remaining portfolio, but am advised that this loan portfolio will require intensive management in order to ensure that the underlying value is realised and that NAMA&rsquo;s advised projected terminal surplus of &euro;3bn can be secured subject to current market conditions prevailing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.367.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600067#WRH03500"><p>The Deputy will be aware that as part of its engagement with the Department, Planning and Local Government, and the Housing Agency, NAMA has played a significant role in facilitating the supply of social housing from its portfolio.</p><p>As part of this engagement, NAMA continuously reviews the assets of all NAMA debtors to establish if vacant residential properties securing their loans could be utilised for social housing.  Up until end-2017, NAMA had identified a total of 6,951 residential properties as being potentially suitably for social housing.  The location of these properties was made known to the Housing Agency, which liaised with local authorities across Ireland to determine the demand for these units.  Of the units identified, demand was confirmed by local authorities for 2,684 properties, of which 2,472 have been contracted or delivered for social housing use to date. </p><p>I would remind the Deputy that confirmation of demand and decisions regarding the suitability of properties is a matter for the local authorities, and NAMA plays no role in this. I understand that local authorities take account of the requirement to provide an appropriate mix of housing tenures and to avoid undue housing segregation within individual developments and wider residential area.  The table below outlines the number of residential units identified by NAMA on a county-by-county basis, the number where demand was confirmed by local authorities and the number delivered to date. This and other information on NAMA&rsquo;s social housing initiatives is available on the NAMA website.</p><p>Once suitability and demand is confirmed for a property, NAMA facilitates contact and negotiation between the NAMA debtor or receiver and a local authority or approved housing body (AHB) to acquire the property. This can take the form of direct purchase by the local authority or AHB, or long-term leasing to the housing body by National Asset Residential Property Services Limited (NARPS).  The creation of NARPS, a special purpose vehicle established by NAMA, was designed to streamline NAMA&rsquo;s social housing delivery.  The role of NARPS is to purchase suitable properties from NAMA debtors for onward leasing to local authorities or AHBs on the basis of long-term, commercial arrangements. </p><p>Prior to the transfer of the property to a housing body, NAMA provides funding to its debtors and receivers to ensure that the properties are completed in full compliance with current building standards and in compliance with all planning conditions.  The Deputy will be aware that many of the properties acquired by NARPS had been incomplete vacant units in unfinished housing estates.  The purchase of these properties by NARPS has often had the effect of triggering a wider programme of completion and remediation for these estates, including the common areas of the unfinished estates.</p><p><b>Table: Total number of dwellings offered and secured for use by local authorities or approved housing bodies, by local authority, to end-2017 </b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Identified by NAMA</th><th>Delivered (Completed &amp;amp; Contracted)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow Co.

A deferral also attracts an interest charge of 4% per annum.</p>  <p>  If the person does not qualify for a deferral or does not wish to avail of such an option, Revenue has assured me that it will work with the person to agree an appropriate phased payment arrangement.

The legislative basis to change the process to an online environment is provided for by Section 95 of the 2014 Finance Act. </p>  <p>  The introduction of &lsquo;eTC&rsquo; means that taxpayers no longer need to provide a paper certificate to confirm tax clearance to a third party.  Instead tax clearance can be verified by simply supplying the unique &lsquo;Tax Clearance Access Number&rsquo; and PPSN to the relevant third party. The only circumstances where a paper Tax Clearance Certificate may still issue is where the taxpayer is not e-enabled, for example no access to technology, or due to infirmity.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the person in question was previously advised that they needed to apply online through the &lsquo;eTC&rsquo; system for tax clearance certification but have to date failed to do so.

This measure is known as Consanguinity Relief. </p><p>Transfers of farmland between certain blood relatives qualify for a reduced rate of stamp duty of 1% provided certain conditions are met. In addition to being a relative of the transferor, the individual to whom the land is transferred or conveyed must either farm the land or lease it to someone who farms the land for a period of not less than 6 years.  The person farming the land must do so on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits. In addition the person farming the land must devote at least 50% of his or her normal working time to farming <b>or</b>be the holder of one of the agricultural qualifications set out in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999.  Since the enactment of Finance Act 2017 on 25 December 2017, there is no age limit for Consanguinity Relief. For transfers executed prior to that date, it was a requirement that the person disposing of the lands be under 67 years of age. </p><p>I have also introduced a measure in Finance Act 2017 to allow a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she sells land and purchases land, in order to consolidate his or her holding. The relief applies to land in the State which is agricultural land with no residential buildings on it and includes commercial woodlands. Where there is a purchase and sale of land within 24 months of each other that satisfy the conditions of consolidation, then stamp duty will only be paid to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold.  In such a situation stamp duty will only apply at the rate of 1% on the excess.  This measure is subject to European Union State Aid rules and will not be commenced until approval is received from the EU. There is no age limit for Farm Consolidation Relief. </p><p>Young Trained Farmer Relief may also be relevant to your query.  This is available to farmers who, subject to certain conditions, qualify for full relief from stamp duty on the transfer of agricultural land.  To qualify for the relief the transferee must, on the date of execution of the instrument of transfer, be less than 35 years of age and be the holder of one of the agricultural qualifications set out in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B to the SDCA 1999.</p><p>In addition to the age and educational qualifications required the transfer must be by way of sale or gift and must be irrevocable.  The young trained farmer, or each of them if there is more than one must retain ownership of the land for a period of 5 years from the date of execution of the instrument and during that time must devote not less than 50 per cent of his or her normal working time to farming the land.</p></reply>

In Budget 2005, relief of 50% on excise duty in respect of beer produced by breweries producing up to 20,000 hectolitres (hl) per annum was provided to reduce barriers of entry and to promote competition in the brewery sector.  Accordingly, the duty of excise on a 4.3% ABV pint of beer produced by a microbrewery is &euro;0.27 compared to &euro;0.54 on a 4.3% ABV non-qualifying pint of beer.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, the relief limit was extended to microbreweries producing not more than 30,000 hectolitres. </p>  <p>  As of Budget 2016, the Alcohol Products Tax relief for small independent breweries was made available by way of a reduction on the duty paid rather than through a repayment of excise.  This improved the cash-flow of small independent breweries and removed a barrier to entry into this market.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 increased the qualifying production threshold for the relief from 30,000 hl to 40,000 hl with a corresponding increase for cooperating independent breweries from 60,000 hl to 80,000 hl.  This allowed production to exceed the previous threshold, though the volume of beer on which the relief could be claimed remained unchanged at 30,000 hl. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that in order to adhere to EU rules, these measures apply to any microbrewery within the European Union.  It does not solely benefit indigenous microbreweries; importers in other EU member states that meet the criteria for this scheme and release supplies of beer for consumption in the State can also avail of the relief. </p>  <p>  Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that in 2016 there were 71 claimants of this relief, with the vast majority relating to beer produced in the State.  The total value of the relief in 2016 was &euro;4.089m, of which &euro;4.03m related to beer produced in the State and &euro;58,000 related to beer imported into the State from the EU.</p>  <p>  There is no such relief available to small distilleries where the applicable EU regime is much less accommodating and where specific public health concerns arise.</p></reply>

The cost may be written off over eight years. </p><p>Where a farmer does not have an entitlement to capital allowances (he or she may be retired and no longer trading for example), relief may be available under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI). HRI provides income tax relief of 13.5% of the cost of certain repairs, renovations and improvements carried out on a person's main residence.  The installation of security equipment (such as CCTV cameras) comes within the terms of the incentive.  It should be noted that, as relief under HRI is restricted to works carried out on a residence, the installation of a CCTV camera to protect an out-building, or other non-residential part of a farm, would not qualify.  The relief is granted by way of a credit against income tax over the two years following the year in which the works are paid for. Half of the relief is given in each year.</p><p>The key features of the scheme are that:</p><p>- the works must be carried out by a tax compliant contractor;</p><p>- the works must be carried prior to 31 December 2018;</p><p>- Local Property Tax payments must be up to date in respect of the property; and</p><p>- the cost of the works must be greater than &euro;4,405 and not more than &euro;30,000 (both figures exclusive of Value Added Tax).

As part of the forecast process my Department produces a forecast for overall investment (gross domestic fixed capital formation), and in line with the national accounts approach, this involves forecasting the overall volume and price changes for newly built residential units.  The sale of existing houses is not included in the national accounts as it is simply the change of ownership of an existing asset, though the value created as part of the sale process is included - for example, the conveyancing activity.  As the Deputy will appreciate, estimates of price inflation for newly built units in the context of the national accounts framework are not the same as forecasts for overall house price inflation.  With this in mind, the current forecast for price inflation of newly built units in 2018, on a national accounts basis, is 5 per cent.  </p>  <p>  In its annual review of residential mortgage lending requirements, the Central Bank concluded that both actual and expected price dynamics are heavily influenced by the current low levels of housing supply.  Increasing supply is key to addressing the current difficulties in the housing market, and the Government has taken a significant number of measures in this area through Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  As you will be aware, Budget 2018 provided significant increases in funding for a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the supply of new homes.  These measures include funding of &euro;750 million for a new vehicle &ndash; Home Building Finance Ireland &ndash; to boost the supply of debt funding to residential development.  An additional &euro;500 million was allocated to build a further 3,000 social housing units by 2021. An extra &euro;75 million is also being provided under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund.  I also announced an increase to the rate applicable under the vacant site levy in the second and subsequent years of continued vacancy.  This will provide a strong incentive to owners of these lands to either develop them or sell them for the purpose of development. </p>  <p>  Although admittedly coming from a low base, the latest figures from the Department of Housing show significant increases in residential construction activity, with Commencement Notices and ESB connections up 36% and 28% respectively to November 2017. My Department will continue to work with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and all other stakeholders to ensure housing supply maintains this growth. Increasing the supply of homes is the most effective method of easing inflationary pressure in the housing market.</p></reply>

Lenders&rsquo; reviews are required to be conducted in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s framework for completion of the Examination (the &ldquo;Framework&rdquo;) issued in December 2015.  The Framework requires lenders to identify all impacted customers and to address customer detriment in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Principles for Redress.  Steps being taken by lenders to address customer detriment identified during the course of the Examination include putting customers on the correct interest rates (rate rectification) in order to stop the immediate harm caused to them, and providing redress and compensation.</p>  <p>  While the Central Bank is not in a position, due to confidentiality requirements under Central Bank legislation, to comment on the position of individual regulated entities, it has provided aggregated information to the public in relation to the Tracker Examination.  The Bank published its most recent aggregate update on progress of the Tracker Mortgage Examination on 20 December 2017. As per the update, as at mid-December, following Central Bank challenge, lenders have included around 33,700 customers as affected by tracker mortgage failings with &euro;297 million paid to that point in redress and compensation. (This includes impacted mortgages identified before the commencement of the industry wide examination.) </p>  <p>  While the Central Bank&rsquo;s view is that the vast majority of customers have now been identified, the Bank will continue to review, challenge and verify the work undertaken by the lenders, and complete its intrusive on-site inspection programme.  The Central Bank will submit a further progress report to me on the basis of end-March 2018 data.  In addition, I have requested the Central Bank to undertake an assessment of the current culture, behaviour and associated risks in Irish retail banks and to consider the further actions that may be taken to ensure that banks prioritise customer interests in the future.   Work is underway on this and I expect it will be finalised by the end of June.  The findings of the report will determine whether any additional legislative or regulatory changes are required to enhance accountability in the banks and to ensure that consumer interests are prioritized.</p></reply>

While appetite is increasing both by the main banks and alternative funding providers to fund residential development there is evidence of emerging supply constraints which could be exacerbated as house building levels increase to meet the economy&rsquo;s required levels in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Given this policy objective it was never the intention of the Government to provide cheap or subsidised funding to developers, nor would it be appropriate to do so.  It has always been envisaged that HBFI would lend on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions, which would depend on the risk profile of each individual project, the quality of collateral and the creditworthiness of the borrower.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor, in that HBFI would not be directly involved in development &ndash; its role would be solely as a commercial lender.  In taking this approach HBFI will be also be designed to comply with State aid rules and its onoing lending activity is not expected to impact the General Government Balance.</p>  <p>  With a proposed allocation of up to &euro;750m, it is estimated that HBFI could have capacity to fund up to 6,000 homes in the coming years.  The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, would reduce this shortfall by about 10% (assuming a three year horizon).  This would be a significant contribution but it would not make HBFI a dominant player in the residential funding market and it would clearly leave room for banks and other finance providers to increase their contribution to funding much-needed residential development.</p>  <p>  Clearly housing finance alone will not deliver houses. However, the Government, through its agencies, will do what it can to provide finance on a commercial basis for housing development. As set out in Rebuilding Ireland, policy actions are required in other areas and the construction sector must play its part in adopting innovative delivery approaches that can boost the productivity of the sector.</p></reply>

This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks. </p>  <p>  However, officials from my Department collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the data published by the Central Bank of Ireland in its Quarterly Trends in Business Credit and Deposits series shows that new lending to Construction enterprises for year-end Q3 2017 totaled &euro;141 million in drawdowns, a growth of almost 20% when compared to the same period in 2016.</p>  <p>  Separately, ISIF is making a very substantial contribution to new private housing supply which is critical in terms of meeting the pent up demand for housing across all sectors of the market. In line with its double bottom line mandate, ISIF has already invested in a number of significant financing platforms and projects in the construction sector, and is actively examining other investment opportunities.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, including those involved in Construction, and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.</p></reply>

It has informed me that all regulated entities, including insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries, must comply with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (&ldquo;the Code&rdquo;).  The Code provides that a regulated entity must act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market, and must make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer.  A regulated entity must ensure that all information it provides to a consumer is clear, accurate, up to date, and written in plain English.  Key information must be brought to the attention of the consumer, and the method of presentation must not disguise, diminish or obscure important information.</p>  <p>  Provision 4.30 and 4.31 of the Code provide that: &ldquo;A regulated entity providing an insurance quotation to a consumer must include the following information in the quotation, assuming that all details provided by the consumer are correct and do not change: a) the monetary amount of the quotation; b) the length of time for which the quotation is valid; and c) the full legal name of the relevant underwriter.&rdquo; and &ldquo;A regulated entity must set out clearly in the quotation provided to the consumer any warranties or endorsements that apply to the policy.  Where the quotation is provided on paper or on another durable medium, this information must not be in a smaller font size than other information provided in the document.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In addition, the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007 provides that the insurer shall, not less than 15 working days prior to the date of expiry of a policy of insurance, where the insurer wishes to invite a renewal, issue to the client in writing a notification of renewal of the policy of insurance, or issue to the client in writing a notification that it does not wish to invite a renewal unless the insurer has reason to believe that the client would not wish to renew the policy.  Finally, Schedule 3 of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1995 sets out the indicative list of terms which may be regarded as unfair. Part (h) cites terms &ldquo;automatically extending a contract of fixed duration where the consumer does not indicate otherwise, when the deadline fixed for the consumer to express this desire not to extend the contract is unreasonably early&rdquo; as being unfair.</p>  <p>  In light of the above, I am satisfied that the legal framework provides sufficient protection to consumers that such practices, as described in the question, are covered under the existing framework.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience, particularly during 2015/2016, of large increases.</p><p>Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016. Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017 (<i><i>)</i></i>.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan. </p><p>Work has been ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The third such update was published on the Department's website on 23 October 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations. </p><p>32 actions were due for completion in the first three quarters of the year in total and 29 of those actions have been completed to date.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  The fourth quarterly update is scheduled to be published within the next few weeks and will focus on the 14 actions which were due for completion in the final quarter of 2017. </p><p>It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for November 2017) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 16.3% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p><p>The Cost of Insurance Working Group is now chaired by Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance.  The Working Group met in full session on a total of 15 occasions during 2017, most recently on 6 December, and will continue to meet regularly throughout 2018.  In parallel with the ongoing implementation of the recommendations from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, the Working Group has also been undertaking an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  </p><p>As part of its preparation of the Motor Report, the Working Group consulted with a wide range of relevant stakeholders (see Appendix 4 of Report for list).  In addition, in his role as Minister of State  for Financial Services and Insurance, Minister D&rsquo;Arcy has met on a regular basis with insurance companies and a wide range of bodies associated with the insurance sector generally, while my officials &ndash; particularly those within the Insurance Policy section &ndash; maintain good day-to-day working relationships with relevant stakeholders including, for example, Insurance Ireland.</p><p>In response to the &ldquo;details supplied&rdquo; section of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the Deputy should be aware that policy in respect of the NCT lies with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The NCT was introduced to comply with an EU Roadworthiness Testing Directive aimed at improving road safety and environmental protection. While the NCT is one component of having safer vehicles on our roads, every vehicle owner has a personal and legal responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy and well maintained.  The NCT is an inspection or general &ldquo;health check&rdquo; of what is visible and accessible on the day of the test and includes a check of the roadworthiness of such safety features as, amongst others, lighting, brakes and tyres.</p><p>The NCT is a minimum requirement of roadworthiness and is therefore not the only rating factor taken into account in the provision of motor insurance.  Insurers will generally require that a vehicle has a valid NCT in order to be covered.  However, in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, they will also use a combination of other rating factors, including the age of the vehicle, as well as the vehicle type, the age of the driver, the claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, how the vehicle is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to the age of a vehicle and the availability/price of cover, different insurance companies will use different age thresholds.</p></reply>

Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  These recommendations were formulated to address the issue of increasing motor insurance costs for taxi drivers and other motorists, whilst taking account of the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The most recent of these was published in October 2017 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i><i></i></i>.  The fourth quarterly update will be published shortly. </p><p>With regard to the taxi sector in particular, I am advised that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  These terms can include the age of the driver, as well as the type and age of car, the claims record, driving experience and penalty points of the driver, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  In the case of taxi drivers, I understand that insurers take into account the nature of the taxi business, which involves driving for hire or reward extensively, and in their view has a much higher risk of injury claims from passengers and other road-users as a result.</p><p>I understand that taxi sector representatives made representations to my Department and the Cost of Insurance Working Group and these were taken into consideration during the review.  The position of the taxi sector was acknowledged by the inclusion in the Report of a recommendation for the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles (commonly referred to as the Taxi Advisory Committee (TAC)) to enter discussions with Insurance Ireland in order to explore solutions for drivers in the sector.  I understand that the TAC met with Insurance Ireland on May 22nd last year to explore solutions for drivers in the sector and reported to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that it agreed that it will continue to engage with Insurance Ireland on this issue in addition to providing a platform for relevant representative groups to provide their views on the cost of insurance.  </p><p>It should be noted that the issues raised by the taxi sector were in the main similar to those affecting consumers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no silver bullet to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that with the cooperation and commitment of all parties, fairer premiums for consumers, including taxi drivers can be delivered over the implementation period of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report.  I would note that the most recent CSO data (for November) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 16.3% from the peak in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high level of the last years.</p></reply>

The Group A threshold (currently &euro;310,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.  The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases. </p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances which are in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.</p>  <p>  Section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for a dwelling house exemption which allows for property to be inherited tax free where the inheritor is already living in the home subject to certain conditions.  Firstly the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person&rsquo;s principal private residence at the date of his or her death. This requirement is relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in in a nursing home. In addition the beneficiary must not have a beneficial interest in another residential property.  Finally the beneficiary must have lived in the house for 3 years prior to the date of the inheritance and must continue to live in the dwelling house for 6 years after the date of the inheritance.  </p>  <p>  If a beneficiary qualifies as a &lsquo;dependent relative&rsquo; then there is no requirement that the dwelling house be the principal private residence of the disponer or that the beneficiary remain in the dwelling house for 6 years after the date of the inheritance.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the disponer, or of the disponer&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65.</p>  <p>  As the dwelling house exemption applies equally to siblings as to any other persons residing together, I therefore have no plans to amend this legislation. </p></reply>

Similarly, if a borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender, the lender must also inform the borrower of other options available to the borrower, such as voluntary surrender, and the implications of these for the borrower and the borrower&rsquo;s mortgage loan account. </p>  <p>  However, as outlined above, the CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  The decision on a voluntary sale and whether to write off any residual debt is a commercial decision for the lender.</p></reply>

This began with the updating of the rules for the sale of financial instruments under MiFID and is also a focus of the IDD legislation.  The aim of European Legislation in these areas is to provide transparency and clarity to the consumer around the advice they are being given. A way of achieving this is to bring in more stringent requirements around how sellers of such products can receive fees or inducements from third parties. There is also a need to ensure a level playing field for all the providers of products, such as insurance or financial instruments, which can be interchangeable in a number of cases.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is implementing the improvements in consumer protection via the transposition of IDD, MiFID II and amendments to the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code 2012. </p>  <p>  As the deadline for transposition of the Insurance Distribution Directive is 23 February 2018.  The Directive is currently in the process of being transposed and it will replace the Insurance Mediation Directive (IMD) which currently regulates point of sale insurance products. </p>  <p>  IDD contains a number of national discretions which are open to Member States to adopt if they so wish.  My Department carried out a public consultation on these discretions in April 2017 and submissions were received from Insurance Ireland, Irish Life Group and Brokers Ireland.</p>  <p>  The discretions set out in Articles 22 and 29 of the Directive, allow Member States to limit or prohibit the acceptance or retaining of fees, commissions or other non-monetary benefits. Following the consideration of the submissions received during the public consultation and consultations with the Central Bank of Ireland, I have decided to exercise part of a discretion contained in Article 29 to prohibit the acceptance and retaining of fees, commissions or other non-monetary benefits in relation to the provision of independent advice for insurance-based investment products.</p>  <p>  I will further consider these discretions following the completion of the Central Bank's work in this area. The Bank issued a Consultation Paper in November, which contains proposals to enhance the protections for consumers when seeking advice from financial intermediaries.  This includes proposals for stricter rules on how financial intermediaries can be paid commission (or other inducements) by the firms whose products they sell. </p>  <p>  The proposed measures require firms to avoid conflicts of interest created by poorly designed inducement arrangements and provide greater transparency for consumers about how a financial intermediary, whose advice they are relying on, is getting paid. </p>  <p>  This consultation will close on 22 March 2018 and I look forward to seeing the Central Banks&rsquo; analysis once they have completed their work. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Commission has recently published a proposal to postpone the implementation date of the IDD requirements to 1 October 2018. This proposal is subject to agreement by the Council, Commission and European Parliament in the normal way.</p>  <p>  The framework on advice in IDD is also replicated in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive or MiFID II, which gives protection for investors in financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or derivatives, and came into effect on 03 January 2018.  Under the legislation, authorised investment firms are banned from accepting fees, commissions or other non-monetary benefits when giving &ldquo;independent&rdquo; investment advice. The exception is where the non-monetary benefit is minor and is of benefit to the quality of service that the firm provides.</p>  <p>  Under MiFID II, I exercised the discretion to allow certain firms such as those authorised under the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995, many of whom are small brokers servicing local markets, to be exempt from the full MiFID II requirements.  However, these firms must be subject to strict rules around consumer protection that are deemed &ldquo;analogous&rdquo; to the MiFID II rules including those around the acceptance of fees and commissions.  To ensure that these firms are covered by analogous rules, the Central Bank updated its Consumer Protection Code (2012) in this area in November 2017.  Under the Code, product producers must be able to demonstrate that any commission arrangements based on levels of business introduced do not impair the intermediary's duty to act in the best interests of the consumers and do not give rise to a conflict of interest between the intermediary and the consumer.</p></reply>

I am therefore unable to provide a precise answer to the question.  However, the Central Statistics Office collects information in its Household Budget Survey on household home insurance (household building or contents insurance or combined building and contents insurance) expenditure.  While this is not a precise indicator of whether a household has home insurance, it does provide a basis for establishing the pattern of household expenditure in relation to home insurance.  </p>  <p>  The survey is conducted every five years and most recently was undertaken between February 2015 and February 2016, inclusive.  I am informed by the CSO that this survey indicated that 91.1% of households, that either own a property outright or own a property with a mortgage, stated that they pay household building or content insurance or combined building and content insurance.   The comparable percentage for rented households was 10.4%.  I understand that this is based on 1,702,000 households in the State (an estimate of the number of occupied households during the survey&rsquo;s reference period), of which almost 70% either own a property outright or own a property with a mortgage.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that with regard to rented households, the type of home insurance that a tenant in such a household might purchase would be for their own contents only, as typically, the buildings and contents insurance would be paid for by the landlord.  I understand that the Survey did not collect information from such households as to whether or not the landlord paid insurance for the rented accommodation, so it would be difficult to make any assumptions on whether such households have home insurance or not.</p></reply>

These statistics satisfy reporting requirements as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1072/2013 of 24 September 2013 (ECB/2013/34)1 as amended by Regulation of the ECB of 8 July 2014 (ECB/2014/30), concerning statistics on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to deposits and loans <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>households and non-financial corporations.  Quarterly mortgage interest rates broken down by property type and interest rate type are also published relating to the Irish market.  The most recent statistics are available on <i>centralbank.ie</i>.</p><p>In addition, the Central Bank announced the introduction of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders.  The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, and became effective on 1 February 2017, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase.  The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p><p>In August 2017, the Central Bank  published a Consultation Paper, see link <i></i>proposing new measures which would enhance the framework of protections for mortgage holders.  In that consultation the Central Bank proposed new measures to require lenders to: </p><p>- inform consumers about other available mortgage options that could save them money and about the impact of mortgage-related incentives; </p><p>- help consumers to compare their existing mortgage to other mortgage options; </p><p>- provide consumers with standardised switching information; and </p><p>- follow a time-bound switching process.</p><p>The consultation period has now ended, and the Central Bank is analysing the responses it received and is considering next steps.  </p></reply>

However property owners can opt to pay the outstanding liability at any time and discontinue with the deferral.  Where a deferral is in place, the outstanding liability remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.  Interest is also charged on the deferred amount at a rate of 4% per annum.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that there are currently almost 62,000 properties with LPT deferrals in place amounting to &euro;61.7m (for all years from 2013 to 2017 inclusive).

The Government recognises this and has put in place a number of measures to ensure that credit unions can continue to provide these vital services to their members and to safeguard the stability of the sector into the future.  These measures include:  </p>  <p>  - establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions;</p>  <p>  - publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012; </p>  <p>  - establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board &ndash; ReBo; </p>  <p>  - establishment of a stabilisation levy to support credit unions that are undercapitalised but are otherwise viable; </p>  <p>  - availability of &euro;250 million for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by ReBo; </p>  <p>  The Commission on Credit Unions was given a mandate to review the future of the credit union sector and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, taking account of their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect members&rsquo; savings and financial stability.  </p>  <p>  The Final Commission Report, March 2012 informed the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, which contains over 60 of those recommendations, and also made a number of recommendations regarding strengthening of the regulatory framework of credit unions, including more effective governance and regulatory requirements.  </p>  <p>  The 2012 Act provides the statutory basis for the restructuring of credit unions and placed the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) on a statutory footing.  The Government provided &euro;250m to the Credit Union Fund for restructuring on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis.  The Government also provided a further &euro;250 million for resolution purposes to ensure the safety of members&rsquo; savings.  In line with the Commission Report, Part 4 of the 2012 Act also provides for a stabilisation process that addresses short-term problems at credit unions that are viable but undercapitalised.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is committed to providing supports to the credit union sector to assist volunteers in fulfilling their regulatory duties.  The Credit Union Handbook sets out the main legislative and regulatory requirements for specific areas and contains additional guidance which credit unions and their volunteers may find useful in furthering their understanding of the various requirements for that area.  The Handbook is updated regularly, specifically when new regulations are introduced or new guidance on a specific area is necessitated.  On introduction of the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations) an FAQ document was published to assist credit unions.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank holds an annual series of information seminars throughout the country to which credit union staff and volunteers are invited.  These seminars provide updates on regulatory developments impacting the sector and provide attendees with an opportunity to meet with staff from the Registry of Credit Unions to discuss issues and pose questions they may have.  The Registrar, Deputy Registrar(s) and staff from the Registry of Credit Unions frequently present on regulatory developments and various other topics at events held by the credit union bodies and other advocacy bodies who provide training and supports to the sector.  The Central Bank website contains a dedicated section for credit unions which contains a repository of information in relation to credit union regulation and contains recent publications and reports which are useful aids to credit unions, their staff and volunteers.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank remains committed to meaningful engagement with credit union directors and other volunteers who provide a significant contribution to the credit union sector.</p>  <p>  Finally, credit unions in Ireland have their own credit union specific legislation which acknowledges the credit union ethos.  This undoubtedly also demonstrates awareness of the distinction between credit unions and other financial service providers.  I consider, from the number of credit union specific changes that have been implemented that it is evident that the Government clearly recognises and has done much to preserve the ethos of the credit union sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.564.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600070#WRL03700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 246, 264 to 270, inclusive, 283 and 285 together.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed on 5 December 2017 that the compulsory retirement age of public servants recruited before 1 April 2004 should be increased to age 70.  This group of public servants currently have a compulsory retirement age of 65.  Primary legislation will be required for the changes to be implemented.  In approving the proposals, the Government also approved the General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to the changes.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has been asked to give priority to the drafting of this legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age for pre 2004 public servants will become effective as soon as possible.  The new compulsory retirement age will only apply to pre-2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 following the commencement of the new legislation.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Government has approved some limited interim arrangements to apply in the period between the Government decision and the commencement of the necessary legislation.  The interim arrangements (which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65) through retirement and re-hire,  will allow pre 2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 in that period to remain in employment only until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66.  The interim arrangements will not apply in the case of public servants who, at age 65, were facilitated by their employer to remain at work until age 66, as they will have already reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66 and will remain at that age until 2021.</p>  <p>  The policy across the public service is that, where a retired employee is re-hired, they are paid at the minimum point of the relevant scale, rather than at the pay point they had reached when they retired.  This practice is continuing in the context of the interim arrangements.  Pension abatement rules will, however, apply in the case of a public servant availing of the interim arrangements.  Pension abatement means that the pension that has been awarded will be reduced so that the person concerned will not receive more in combined pension and salary payments than they would have received if they had remained working.  Given that the person's "new" salary will be at the minimum point, there will be room through the payment of pension and the "new" salary rate so that the sum of the "new" salary rate and the pension in payment can address the difference between the minimum point of the scale and the pay point they had reached when they retired.  </p>  <p>  Under the interim arrangements, the additional service will not accrue public service pension benefits, as the primary legislation is necessary to enable this.  The employee&rsquo;s pension or lump sum payment will not be affected by this move to a lower pay point, as the persons will already have retired and be in receipt of their pension entitlements.</p>  <p>  It is not intended that the practice of payment at the minimum point would apply to public servants who choose to remain beyond the age of 65 once the legislation is commenced.  Those public servants will not be in the position of having retired and been re-hired.  It is intended that when the legislation is enacted, it will allow for the retention of public servants who reach the age of 65 following the commencement of the legislation, on current terms and conditions.  Additional service will count towards pension accrual subject to the statutory maximum of 40 years and pension entitlements will then become payable at the date of retirement.</p>  <p>  The increase in the compulsory retirement age followed a review of the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce carried out by my Department, in consultation with public service employers.  The engagement with public service employers included discussion in relation to the interim arrangements to apply in the period between the Government Decision and the commencement of the necessary legislation.  Under the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement (Para.  6.4.2) staff representatives were also consulted.</p></reply>

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP).  </p>  <p>  Dundalk and Blackrock South is an Area of Further Assessment under the CFRAM Programme and includes the area of Red Barns Road.  The proposed Plan, which addresses the fluvial and coastal risk along Red Barns Road, consists of a series of hard defences, including; flood embankments and walls, rock armour coastal protection, demountable barriers, road raising and sluice gates.  The proposed plan includes improvement of channel conveyance on the Blackrock River, together with flood attenuation on the Castletown River.</p>  <p>  The FRMPs are currently subject to an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, I would hope in the coming weeks to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the Flood Risk Management Plans.</p></reply>

Coastal erosion may threaten human life, infrastructure such as roads, and may undermine and cause damage to properties.  However, it should also be recognised that coastal erosion also has beneficial effects to the local environment, such as providing natural nourishment and supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.</p><p>The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss of economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.</p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website.  The relevant reports and associated predictive erosion hazard mapping (to 2050) may be viewed at </p><p><i>www.opw.ie/en/flood-risk-management/floodanderosionmapping/icpss/.</i></p><p>This Study has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.</p><p>The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources.  If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.</p><p>Because intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options.  </p><p>The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance.  Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial.</p><p>The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, available on the OPW website at <i>www.opw.ie/en/media/Final%20Guidelines%20&amp;amp;%20Schedules%20A%20&amp;amp;%20B%2030-03-12.pdf.</i></p></reply>

The road Deputy Healy-Rae refers to appears to be a private or non-public road. </p><p>I would therefore refer to the response to PQ 52581/17 given by Minister Michael Ring on 7 December 2017 concerning funding for private and non-public roads. </p><blockquote>My Department wrote to Local Authorities last August to establish the level of demand for a local improvement scheme this year.  This is a nation-wide scheme which The Local Authorities were advised that any requests for funds would be subject to their capacity to complete any proposed works in 2017, and funding availability.<br /><br />On 21st September last, I announced the provision of &euro;10 million for a Local Improvement Scheme to support improvement works on private and non-public roads.<br /><br />Based on demand for the scheme and the capacity of Local Authorities to complete works before the end of the year, I announced an additional &euro;7.4 million for LIS roads at the end of November which has now been allocated to Local Authorities.  There has been significant progress on the scheme, with registered expenditure of &euro;14.1 million to date.<br /><br />I recognise that there is an underlying demand for further LIS funding, as no dedicated funding stream has been available for these type of works for a number of years.  I have therefore secured a further allocation of &euro;10 million for LIS in my Department's Estimate for 2018.  Allocations for 2018 are provisional and subject to the publication of the Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services.<br /><br />Details of the 2018 scheme will be announced early in the New Year.</blockquote></reply>

It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.</p>  <p>  The Flood Risk Management Plans are now being finalised taking account of all observations and comments received as part of the statutory public consultation on the Draft Plans.  The OPW is on track to finalise the Flood Risk Management Plans, in early 2018, for approval by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Drogheda is an Area of Further Assessment under the Eastern CFRAM Study area and includes the area of the North Quay.  The proposed CFRAM Plan for Drogheda include such physical works as a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) along the River Boyne together with improvement of conveyance and a flow diversion channel on various tributaries.  Some sealing of manholes and localised raising of roads is also proposed, as are automated defences to allow continued operation of port activities.  </p>  <p>  The CFRAM Flood Risk Management Plan for Drogheda proposes to progress the project-level development and assessment of the Flood Relief Scheme which will including environmental assessment as necessary, further public consultation for refinement and preparation for planning and, if and as appropriate, implementation.</p></reply>

This is known as Risk Assessment. The aim of Risk Assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work. The Risk Assessment(s) will form part of the employer's Safety Statement.</p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 set out the First-Aid requirements for workplaces as follows: "Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places at work where working conditions require it. Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided. Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate. Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place."</p>  <p>  It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.</p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. </p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine.</p>  <p>  The NCSE are currently undertaking a Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme. In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment, the NCSE were requested to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. </p>  <p>  This Working Group, which is chaired by Mr. Eamon Stack, Chairperson of the NCSE Council, has commenced its work and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the overall Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme. It is intended that the reports of the Working Group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. </p>  <p>  In tandem with this, a cross Departmental Working Group has been established to develop proposals in relation to the need for nursing supports in certain special schools for children with complex medical needs. </p>  <p>  In relation to insurance, the position is that the nature and terms of an individual school&rsquo;s insurance arrangements are a matter between the individual school and its insurers. </p></reply>

Children with autism can be enrolled in an early intervention class from the age of 3.</p>  <p>  Children in early intervention classes benefit from a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. Class teachers are fully qualified and have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to training in a range of autism-specific interventions. Each class will have a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants. </p>  <p>  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes which can be supported by Special Needs Assistants and fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) as well as the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. </p>  <p>  The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents/guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.</p>  <p>  However, parents/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local National Council for Special Education Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.  </p>  <p>  The SENO can also advise parents in relation to supports which may be available to support children with special educational needs, including special transport arrangements which may be made available.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Special Education Home Tuition Grant Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme also provides a compensatory educational service for children with special educational needs seeking an educational placement and provision is made for early educational intervention for children with autism.</p>  <p>  Where there is no Early Intervention class placement available, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available.</p>  <p>  Where a parent/guardian does not enrol a child in a school placement as identified by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), a grant for Home Tuition will not be provided. Accordingly, Home Tuition is provided as an interim measure only for children for whom a placement in a recognised school is not available and should not be regarded as an optional alternative to a school placement.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs also provides supports for childcare, including pre-school education.</p>  <p>  The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.  </p>  <p>  Children with disabilities have access to pre-school services under the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) programme of supports.</p>  <p>  AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school. </p>  <p>  Details of the supports which are available under AIM can be found at www.preschoolaccess.ie which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports. For children attending a private pre-school through the ECCE programme, questions relating to the AIM supports should be addressed to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

The offence arises where a person knows or believes that a specified offence has been committed against a child or vulnerable person and he or she has information which would help arrest, prosecute or convict another person for that offence, but fails, without reasonable excuse, to disclose that information as soon as it is practicable to do so to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 are in addition to the reporting obligations under Children First National Guidance 2017 and the Children First Act, 2015.</p></reply>

My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government I have committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the Act on a non-statutory basis.</p><p>At present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans. My Department's Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs. In line with Circular 30/2014, schools are also required to put in place Personal Pupil Plan including a care plan for all pupils availing of SNA support.</p><p>Guidelines for schools on educational planning and monitoring of outcomes and the manner in which they should conduct educational planning, through the Student Support File, are contained in the Guidelines for Schools: Supporting Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools, available at www.education.ie/en/The-Education-System/Special-Education/Guidelines-for-Primary-Schools-Supporting-Pupils-with-Special-Educational-Needs-in-Mainstream-Schools.pdf.</p><p>Educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils&rsquo; needs. Educational plans should be differentiated in line with a pupil's needs. A pupil's support plan should include clear, measurable learning targets, and specify the resources and interventions that will be used to address student needs in line with the Continuum of Support process. Individualised support plans for pupils should be developed through a collaborative process involving relevant teachers, parents/guardians, the pupils themselves and outside professionals, as necessary. The individualised planning process should include regular reviews of learning targets as part of an ongoing cycle of assessment, target setting, intervention and review. </p><p>Providing power to the National Council for Special Education, as envisaged under Section 10 of the EPSEN Act, to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, is currently being considered in the context of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, published in 2013, and the Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs, published in 2014. </p><p>This new model for allocating support to pupils with special educational needs has been implemented from September 2017.  Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and Circular 0014/2017 for post primary schools which were published on 7th March 2017 sets out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  The revised allocation model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.  The Guidelines for Schools: Supporting Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools also provides guidance on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers. One of the benefits of this new approach is that schools will have greater flexibility as to how they will deploy their resources.</p><p>The NCSE is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, in consultation with other relevant Departments and State Agencies, including the National Disability Authority (NDA), to identify the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.</p><p>In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment, the NCSE were requested to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. This Working Group has commenced its work and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the overall Comprehensive Assessment of the SNA Scheme. </p><p>It is intended that the reports of the Working Group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. </p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p></reply>

This included an increase in annual recurrent funding to LYIT by &euro;2.3m.  </p><p>In their financial statements y/e 31 August 2016, the institute achieved a reduced deficit of &euro;137k ( 1,358k in 2015) and will meet this deficit through accumulated reserves. </p><p>In 2017, the institute was budgeting for an operating surplus for the first time in six years and confirmed in late 2017 that this was on target for achievement. </p><p>However, an annual deficit of &euro;1.4m per annum is currently being attributed to School of Tourism, Killybegs. This is a function of relatively low student numbers coupled with relatively high staff numbers.  To seek in part to address this issue, I, approved the provision of ring-fenced funding of &euro;750k per annum for 4 years from 2017 to 2020.  This funding was approved following recommendations of the 2014 Working Group which was appointed to examine the financial viability of the Killybegs campus.  The institution is working closely with a financial expert and the HEA to ensure a financially viable future for the campus.  </p><p>I have attached the following tables in reply to the queries: </p><p>1:  Letterkenny IT Records of Annual Surplus/Deficit 2007-2016 (calendar year)</p><p>2:  Letterkenny IT Income - state vs non state - Income sources 2007-2016 (academic year)*</p><p>3: Letterkenny IoT summary - core grant, fees and student contribution by income stream (calendar year)</p><p><b>*Please note the most recent figures available are for the 2015/16 academic year. </b></p><p><b>Table 1.

Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. </p>  <p>  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries and caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  In December 2017 my Department issued circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at: </p>  <p>  Circular 0078/2017: www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0078_2017.pdf.</p>  <p>  Circular 0079/2017: www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0079_2017.pdf.</p>  <p>  The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrators recommendation applies.  The circulars issued by my Department set out the revised rates of grant funding for schools and an application process whereby schools can apply for additional funding in order to enable them to pay the revised rates set out in the circulars.</p></reply>

SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices in the craft apprenticeships remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system in Ireland into a range of new sectors of the economy, following two calls for new apprenticeship proposals from employers and education and training providers.  To date nine new apprenticeship programmes are operational and we are now seeing a strong increase in female participation in many of these new programmes, particularly in the financial and hospitality sectors.  With further new apprenticeships to get underway this year, many of which that are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace, it is expected, as these new apprenticeships are rolled out, that this will lead to a continued increase in female participation.</p>  <p>  As set out in our Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, my Department will, in conjunction with SOLAS, review the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation. The review will be completed later this year.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a digital campaign to promote apprenticeship is now underway with a dedicated Twitter feed #Generation Apprenticeship, a new apprenticeship website www.apprenticeship.ie, an Apprenticeship Ireland Facebook page and a LinkedIn page. In all aspects of the digital campaign women feature prominently and there will be a specific focus on encouraging women and girls to consider apprenticeship as a means of launching or developing their careers.</p></reply>

A number of matters relating to higher education, including the TUSE project, were discussed at the meeting. </p>  <p>  The institutes of technology in a consortium lead on the progression of their plans to seek designation as a technological university. </p>  <p>  The Government is supporting the progression of technological university development in both the advancement currently of the Technological Universities Bill through the legislative process and in the provision of significant Exchequer funding to the four consortia of institutes of technology currently involved in projects to develop technological universities. </p>  <p>  Most recently in November 2017 my Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), allocated some &euro;4.64 million in funding across the relevant consortia. Further Exchequer funding has been allocated for TU development in 2018. The HEA interacts directly with all consortia in the context of the funding process for TU development. </p>  <p>  In addition, in implementing the Systems Performance Framework for Higher Education, progress on the development of TU projects has been a key part of the HEA&rsquo;s conversations with relevant individual institutions as part of the strategic dialogue process. Within this process, the HEA has provided detailed feedback to the institutions involved including those comprising the TUSE consortium.</p></reply>

Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification model. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this was a first step in a process and the fact that a school was not included in September 2017 does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports.</p>  <p>  In the context of future planning for DEIS and the preparation of briefing for the estimates process for Budget 2018 analysis was conducted as to the cost of extending DEIS further by admitting schools with levels below the highest concentrations of disadvantage. It was in the context of this cost analysis, for a possible extension of the DEIS scheme at lower concentrations of disadvantage, that the figure of 257 schools arose. There has been no question of excluding schools. It is important to note that these 257 schools did not meet the criteria of those schools admitted in September 2017.</p>  <p>  In relation to the location of the 257 schools, the levels of disadvantage in individual schools is not in the public domain and release of this information would give rise to speculation as to the levels of disadvantage in individual schools. Therefore it is not possible to provide this information to you.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that for the first time, I have introduced an objective, statistics based model for deciding which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS Programme, so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest concentrated levels of disadvantage. A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.</p>  <p>  A further assessment of all schools taking account of updated school data and the HP Index, based on the 2016 National Census is currently underway. Schools are being advised to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date including Eircode which can now be recorded by schools on both POD and PPOD databases. It is intended to have the process completed by the end of Q1 2018. </p>  <p>  This will allow new pupil data and the changes in the profile of small areas between 2011 and 2016 to be taken into account in measuring the profile of schools. Schools at the high threshold of disadvantage may be identified in this process. It is intended, subject to available resources, to bring any such additional schools into the scheme . </p></reply>

This is to ensure that primary teachers have the capacity to lead in these significant areas of student learning. </p><p>In October 2017, I announced changes to these minimum entry requirements, as follows:</p><p>Entry 2018 - Irish: H5, English: H7/O5, Maths: H7/O6</p><p>Entry 2019 and entry 2020 - Irish: H4, English: H7/O4, Maths: H7/O4</p><p>The changes that I introduced took account of advice to me provided by the Teaching Council, which had engaged in a consultation process around a number of matters relating to entry to initial teacher education. Many of the issues identified were complex and the Council commissioned the ESRI to carry out a research to inform its deliberation. </p><p>The changes also had regard to the Department&rsquo;s policy &ldquo;Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education &ndash; Implementation and Next Steps&rdquo; (2015).</p><p>In determining the revised entry requirements, care was taken not to disadvantage those students who have already commenced the senior cycle and who intend sitting the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2018. Accordingly, I decided that the minimum entry grades for entry to primary Initial Teacher Education programmes should be increased for 2019 and 2020, rather than from 2018. </p><p>The revision of entry criteria for primary initial teacher education is part of a wider range of actions being implemented or developed to achieve the objective of developing the continuum of teacher education to equip teachers with the right skills for 21st century teaching and learning, and the overall vision of making the Irish education and training system the best in Europe over the next decade.</p><p>Further changes to the minimum entry requirements from 2021 onwards will be considered in the light of experience, relevant policy developments and following consultation with relevant stakeholders. </p><p>I do not plan to further adjust the minimum entry requirements or to allow exemptions to the requirements, in advance of this.</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p>  <p>  A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.</p>  <p>  Schools included in DEIS with effect from September 2017 are those whose level of disadvantage has been identified as those schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage among their pupil cohort. Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification model. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is the first step in a process and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports. </p>  <p>  A further assessment of all schools will take account of updated data as it becomes available. Schools are being advised to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date, including Eircode which can now be recorded by schools on both POD and PPOD databases. The HP Index, based on the 2016 National Census data has been published recently. </p>  <p>  Should this exercise reveal that any school, which did not qualify for DEIS in 2017, meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the updated information then additional schools may be included subject to available resources.</p></reply>

An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p>  <p>  Significant improvement has been made in recent years with the number of primary schools on broadband speeds of greater than 30mbs having increased from less than 100 in 2012 to over 1000 by the end of 2017. In Wicklow in 2012, no primary school had access to broadband speeds of 30mbs or greater, now some 30 primary schools in Wicklow have access to broadband speeds of 30mbs or greater.</p>  <p>  The school referred to be by the Deputy has the best broadband solution available (5 Mbp/s), given the infrastruture in that area.  The service was last reviewed in 2015 in the context of contract renewal, and the available options will be reviewed again later this year </p>  <p>  The school is included in the National Broadband Plan Intervention area (NBP), the Government's National Broadband Plan aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment tasked with implementing this rollout. The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is currently in the formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan.</p>  <p>  The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p>  <p>  - The  AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing  procurement process.</p>  <p>  - The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  - The Light BLUE areas represent Eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream. </p><p>Others may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational supports to schools. It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.</p><p>The NCSE has advised my Department that the child referred to by the Deputy is attending a mainstream class and accessing SNA support. Recent professional reports indicate that the child will require a special class placement. The NCSE local SENO has identified a number of special class placement options for the 2018/19 school year to the child&rsquo;s Parent&rsquo;s. </p><p>The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department and the NCSE has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE has advised the parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.</p><p>In this regard, where Parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a special class placement for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p><p>The NCSE is continuing to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services for children with special educational needs, to ensure that each child has a placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year.</p><p>The NCSE pamphlet on moving between and mainstream and special settings provides information and practical guidance for Parent&rsquo;s on supporting their child to make a successful transition.

The aim of the programme is to provide vocal and instrumental music tuition in non-mainstream settings for young people 18 years and under.  11 MEPs were established under the first phase of the programme.</p>  <p>  In January 2017, Music Generation announced an open call for potential MEPs to apply for inclusion in Phase 2 of the programme. This phase of Music Generation will be initially supported by philanthropic funding, with Exchequer support from my Department becoming available from 2020. </p>  <p>  Applications for inclusion in Phase 2 of the programme were assessed against stated selection criteria by an expert selection committee established by Music Generation and which included representation from my Department. The nine new MEP areas for Phase 2 were announced by the board of Music Generation in September 2017.</p>  <p>  The number of applications received for Phase 2 of the programme exceeded the number of MEPs that could be supported by the available funding, with the result that some applicants were inevitably disappointed not to be selected for this phase.  </p>  <p>  I can advise, however, that as part of the launch in December last of A Plan to Enable the Creative Potential of Every Child and Young Person, it was announced that the Government would support the rollout of Music Generation nationwide by 2022. The plan is part of the Government&rsquo;s Creative Ireland programme and was launched by the Taoiseach, together with myself, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. My Department will work with Music Generation to discuss the details and logistics of the nationwide roll-out and more details will be announced at a later date. </p></reply>

Although not always made aware of changes in school times in advance, Bus &Eacute;ireann is available to work with schools to advise what is operationally feasible bearing in mind that in most cases the bus providing the school transport service to one school is also required to operate a separate service to another school as part of a local network of coordinated school transport services.  </p>  <p>  Consultation between all parties would help to ensure that the most efficient service can be provided for the benefit of the families and schools served as well as continuing to provide the local network of services in the most economic fashion on behalf of the taxpayer.</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p>  <p>  A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.</p>  <p>  Schools included in DEIS with effect from September 2017 are those whose level of disadvantage has been identified as those schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage among their pupil cohort. Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification model. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is the first step in a process and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports. </p>  <p>  A further assessment of all schools will take account of updated data as it becomes available. Schools are being advised to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date, including Eircode which can now be recorded by schools on both POD and PPOD databases. The HP Index, based on the 2016 National Census data has been published recently. </p>  <p>  Should this exercise reveal that any school, which did not qualify for DEIS in 2017, meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the updated information then additional schools may be included subject to available resources.</p></reply>

Recognised schools must fulfil a number of conditions regarding curriculum, inspection and other matters.</p>  <p>  It is the policy of my Department that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in recognised school settings through the primary and post primary school network. </p>  <p>  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016) found that Students are generally well supported in schools with appropriate curriculum; extensive teacher and SNA supports; improving range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment; improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post primary levels.</p>  <p>  The NCSE policy advice noted that ASD is a spectrum condition, so some students with ASD may require little support in school and are relatively independent in their learning, while others require significant levels of support. </p>  <p>  The NCSE Policy Advice also states that International Research findings suggest that most students with ASD should be considered for inclusion in mainstream education with their peers, where inclusion is well-planned and well-resourced.</p>  <p>  Decisions about placement should be based on individual needs and take into account a number of factors including parental wishes, availability of evidence-based treatments and well-trained staff and individual factors such as targets for intervention and management of behaviours.</p>  <p>  Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there. This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream. </p>  <p>  Others may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p>  <p>  There is therefore not one preferred educational environment for children with ASD, rather there is a model which takes into account the assessed educational needs of individual pupils.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs in conjunction with schools and the Health Service Executive (HSE). This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  The local SENOs are available to assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs. The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE also works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school.  </p>  <p>  The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at www.tusla.ie/get-in-touch/education-and-welfare/.</p>  <p>  Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. The availability of a school placement is assessed by the NCSE having regard to, although not limited to, the relevant diagnosis and relevant professional report. </p>  <p>  The Home Tuition Grant Scheme also provides a compensatory educational service for Students, enrolled in schools, with significant medical conditions which has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, major disruption to their attendance at school. </p>  <p>  Where parents choose to educate their children in places other than recognised schools they are not eligible to avail of resources, including the Home Tuition Grant, which they may have accessed through enrolling or seeking to enrol their child in a recognised school.</p></reply>

The role of the Monitoring Committees is to monitor and, in consultation with the National Disability Authority (NDA), encourage compliance with the Act by all public bodies under its aegis. </p>  <p>  Under the relevant legislation, aegis bodies of my Department are required to provide my Department&rsquo;s Monitoring Committee with data on the number of people with disabilities employed in their organisations during the preceding year for inclusion in an annual report on compliance.

These forms provide for the confidential and anonymous disclosure by staff of a disability and this information is used solely for statistical purposes. While staff are encouraged to report disabilities for the purpose of this Part 5 process, the collation of data is largely reliant on the voluntary disclosure of such disabilities by individuals.</p>  <p>  Eighteen aegis bodies of my Department are obliged to report under the Act.

This letter advised that a small cohort of schools would be selected for this initial phase. The letter also advised of the section criteria that would be used to assist in selecting the Phase 1 schools, viz. </p>  <p>  -  There is support from the Board of Management and senior leadership within the school, in consultation with the school community, for this initiative;</p>  <p>  -  The school is willing to offer Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject on the time-table from September 2018;</p>  <p>  -  The school can identify a teacher (or teachers) with relevant experience and/or qualifications who are willing to teach Computer Science and participate in the required professional development within school time;</p>  <p>  -  Teachers are willing to participate in some professional development in their own time if and when the need arises;</p>  <p>  -  The school has a viable number of students interested in studying Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group chaired by my Department was established to oversee the implementation of the new subject. The applications received from schools to participate in Phase 1, over 130 of them, were examined and assessed by a sub-group of this steering group. The 40 schools identified by the Selection sub-group, which included a spread by geographical area and school type, were subsequently approved by the Steering Group. </p>  <p>  While many of the applications received from schools were of high quality, the requirement to have a relatively small number of schools comprising the Phase 1 cohort meant that some schools would be inevitably disappointed. However, it is my Department&rsquo;s intention, following the experience of the Phase 1 implementation, to ultimately offer Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate option to all interested schools.</p>  <p>  Schools that were unsuccessful in their application to participate in Phase 1 have been notified accordingly. While understanding the Deputy's request for specific details in relation to schools in Louth that may have applied for inclusion in Phase 1, it is not the place of the Department to provide details of unsuccessful applicants. Unsuccessful schools were not advised that such details would be shared. </p></reply>

This is in keeping with good international practice. </p>  <p>  -  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities. Over 4,000 children have so far benefited from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.</p>  <p>  Details of the supports which are available under AIM can be found at www.preschoolaccess.ie which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.  </p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the commencement of the ECCE programme in 2010. At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  </p>  <p>  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week, in the absence of targetted supports such as those provided for under AIM, was considered challenging and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two. Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks. </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved. This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with officials of my Department are currently commissioning a review of the overage exemption arrangements and I understand that the exemption arrangements have been retained pending the completion of that review </p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to ensure that all children with Special Educational Needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in age appropriate school settings through the primary and post primary school network. </p>  <p>  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s policy is that all children must be enrolled in the primary school system, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools in the September prior to their sixth birthday. If children are not in school by six years of age, under the Education Welfare Act 2000, the Educational Welfare service must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school. At present there are no plans to amend this policy. </p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p>  <p>  A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that schools included in DEIS with effect from September 2017 are those whose level of disadvantage has been identified as those schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage among their pupil cohort. Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification model. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that this is the first step in a process and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports. </p>  <p>  A further assessment of all schools will take account of updated data as it becomes available. Schools are being advised to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date, including Eircode which can now be recorded by schools on both POD and PPOD databases. The HP Index, based on the 2016 National Census data which is now available. </p>  <p>  Should this exercise reveal that any school, which did not qualify for DEIS in 2017, meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the updated information then additional schools may be included subject to available resources.</p></reply>

My Department is committed to supporting the registration of apprentices across all sectors, including the construction sector, and I understand from SOLAS that the forecast for future apprenticeship registrations in the sector remain strong.</p>  <p>  Construction related apprentice registrations increased from 1,677 in 2015 to 2,285 in 2016 which represents an increase of 36%.  This trend continued in 2017 with a further increase of 30% on the 2016 figure bringing the total number of construction related registrations to 2,976.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, we are currently expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry. Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 an apprenticeship in Engineering Services Management, with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) as industry lead, is currently being developed into a national apprenticeship programme.  In addition, we recently announced 26 new programmes, arising from last year&rsquo;s second call for proposal, to be further developed into national apprenticeships, including a scaffolding apprenticeship, again with the CIF as industry lead and a senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland as industry lead.  These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs identified by the sector.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a digital campaign to promote apprenticeship is now underway with a dedicated Twitter feed #Generation Apprenticeship, a new apprenticeship website www.apprenticeship.ie, an Apprenticeship Ireland Facebook page and a LinkedIn page. The campaign seeks to promote the values of the apprenticeship model for both employers and prospective apprentices.</p></reply>

All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete.  We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; was published on 9th June 2017.  While the report focusses on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, the report outlined the work which will be required to establish a long term model of post-primary teacher supply. In October 2017, the Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and a further meeting is due to take place in the coming weeks which will build on the initial discussions and will further inform our thinking in this matter. </p>  <p>  Regarding issues around finding substitution at primary level, there are strong career opportunities in teaching and the number of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018.  This increase in the number of permanent primary school teaching positions is providing strong opportunities for graduates to get permanent jobs.  Due to the additional permanent positions being created, young teachers have greater opportunities to take on permanent positions, and as a result some schools may be experiencing issues in hiring teachers to fill temporary or substitute roles, which arise in schools for a number of reasons, including covering sick leave and career breaks.</p>  <p>  I have already undertaken some measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies.  My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council.  My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year. In addition, as a longer term measure, under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht Policy, a new Irish-medium B.Ed. (primary teaching) ITE programme is being developed.</p>  <p>  We are assessing other policy initiatives to increase the supply of teachers available to primary schools for substitute work and I am committed to examining all possible means to address the issue.</p></reply>

National and international research has consistently shown that the qualified classroom teacher is the best placed professional to work sensitively and consistently with students and that s/he can have a powerful impact on influencing students&rsquo; attitudes, values and behaviour in all aspects of health education.</p>  <p>   Circular 23 of 2010 which issued to all Post-Primary Schools advised that the SPHE/RSE programme should have a substantial skills development element and should not merely be information based. Such skills are developed over time and founded on an on-going relationship based on trust, understanding and mutual respect.  </p>  <p>  Circular 22 of 2010 which issued to all Primary Schools advised that a whole-school approach to the consistent implementation of SPHE is essential and that the classroom teacher is responsible for the implementation of the SPHE curriculum. </p>  <p>  Young people flourish in an environment where there is a whole-school approach to the holistic growth of students and where there is a shared belief in their potential for development, learning and wellbeing.</p>  <p>   At primary level, every teacher is fully trained to deliver the SPHE programme, as part of their Initial Teacher Education programme.  The Health and Wellbeing Team in the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) provides an extensive programme of continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities to support teachers and schools in the implementation of RSE and SPHE programmes in primary and post-primary schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  </p>  <p>  In the case of existing schools, where a school is not in a position to accommodate a special class within its existing accommodation, it is open to the school to submit an application to the Department for capital funding to (i) re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or (ii) to construct additional accommodation.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the NCSE has approached the school referred to by the Deputy to establish a special class for the coming school year and that my Department is currently reviewing the accommodation needs for the school.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills plays an important role in the development and implementation of the two national practice frameworks, S&iacute;olta (quality) and Aistear (curriculum).  My Department also supports and advises the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on qualifications and workforce development and is in the process of conducting a review of education and training programmes for early years practitioners.  My Department, with its agencies, works to ensure that there is a smooth transition for children from pre-school into the primary school sector and also supports the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the implementation of AIM &ndash; the Access and Inclusion Model for children with disabilities.  However, beyond the promotion of this alignment and support for quality, there is no plan to further integrate the schools sector - statutory provision for which lies with the Minister for Education and Skills - with the formal Early Childhood Education and Care sector which is the responsibility of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

The report provides a solid evidence base to inform future policy development and to ensure provision is planned to meets the needs of learners and employers, taking into account all of the changes that have taken place, particularly in the labour market, since the programme was established in the mid 80s.</p>  <p>  It confirms the positive role played by PLCs in providing education for a diverse range of learners, highlighting that on average PLC learners are 16% more likely to be employed and 27% more likely to have progressed to higher education, than those who left education with the Leaving Certificate alone.  It also points to a greater need to develop systems to ensure that PLC courses focused on the labour market are aligned with employer requirements and are responsive to changing labour market needs.</p>  <p>  Arising from the evaluation, SOLAS will shortly establish the PLC Programme Improvement Advisory Committee, comprised of PLC partners, to oversee development and implementation of a three year programme improvement plan.  Based on the recommendations set out in the SOLAS response, implementation of the plan will ensure delivery of high quality education and training supporting learners to achieve their progression and employment goals.</p>  <p>  SOLAS will publish quarterly implementation progress reports, following their review by the SOLAS Board and my Department.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015.   </p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.   </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016.  These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the DSS and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  The recruitment and appointment of the Director of the DSS, and the appointment of DSS staff, is a matter for the Mental Health Commission with the approval of the Minister for Health. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.</p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  It is not possible at the moment to provide an exact time line for the full implementation of the 2015 Act, not least because the newly appointed Director will need to fully scope out the time line for the implementation of the Act.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Budget provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

There is no such procedure as described in the Deputy's question set out in the relevant statute which is the Coroner Act 1962.</p>  <p>  If a person dies in Ireland, in a manner reportable to the coroner, it is the coroner who determines if a post-mortem examination (and potentially an inquest) is required.  Such post-mortem examinations are carried out at the direction of the coroner by a pathologist based in in a hospital in most cases, with a smaller number being conducted by the State Pathologist.  This is the standard and statutory process under the Coroner Act. </p>  <p>  My Department officials have informed me that they are not aware that any coroner post-mortem examination has ever been conducted outside the State.</p>  <p>  If the death is not one reportable to a coroner, neither the coroner or my Department has any role.

This is a voluntary process.</p>  <p>  If neither of these two scenarios hold, then the next of kin would be at liberty to transfer or repatriate the body out of the State.

Such acts represent a blatant disregard for the safety of the brave men and women who work in our emergency services, who risk their lives every day in the service of the people of our State.  </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the fire services do not come within my remit, however, to be of assistance I sought the information requested from the Department of Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government who have advised that the information is not compiled by them as Fire Fighters are Local Authority Staff.  However, it does remain open to the Deputy to contact the Local Authority directly who may be able to assistant him further in this regard.</p><p>In relation to Prison Officers, the following table provides a breakdown of the number of assaults that have been recorded against prison officers in the each of the past five years by geographical location and I hope the Deputy finds this information useful. </p><p>In June 2015, following a number of serious assaults on prison staff, the States Claims Agency commenced a review of assaults on prison staff by prisoners in accordance with Section 8 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000.</p><p>In November 2016 the SCA presented the report to the then T&aacute;naiste.  The report noted many positive findings including that, given the number of committals in 2015, the ratio of assaults to the number of prisoners in the system was very low.  The role of a prison officer is a difficult and challenging one. Prison staff must deal with a wide range of complex issues and there are occasions when they are subjected to unacceptable acts of violence.</p><p>The report contains a large number of recommendations.  These recommendations were accepted and will be implemented - an undertaking that has been included as a &quot;Key Action&quot; in the Irish Prison Service's Strategic Plan 2016-2018.  The Irish Prison Service is committed to creating a safer environment for all those who work or live within our prison walls.  In addition, the Service is committed to ensuring that any staff member who is subject to or witnesses an assault is given the necessary supports in the aftermath of the incident.</p><p>Given the substantive nature of the recommendations, an implementation plan will be developed and actioned over the course of the next two years.</p><p>More generally, Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 specifically provides for assaults or threats to peace officers, including prison officers acting in the execution of their duty.  Any person who assaults or threatens to assault a peace officer in the execution of their duty is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both, or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years, or both.  In addition, the Act allows for judges to impose such sentences consecutively on persons found guilty of such offences.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that every assault on our front-line staff is treated as serious and appropriate action, including the reporting of such assaults to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purposes of investigation and criminal prosecution, occurs where appropriate.</p><p>I have sought a similar breakdown from the Garda authorities in respect of the number of assaults against Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I will contact the Deputy directly when the information is to hand.</p><p><b>Prisoner on Staff assaults</b><table><tr><th>Prison/Place of Detention</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017*</th></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>20</td><td>8</td><td>21</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>13</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>D&oacute;chas Centre</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>26</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>17</td><td>7</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (Male) </td><td>19</td><td>34</td><td>30</td><td>22</td><td>12</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>St.Patrick's Inst.</td><td>36</td><td>49</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>26</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>PSEC</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>OSG </td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>107</td><td>147</td><td>151</td><td>91</td><td>98</td><td>41</td></tr></table></p><p>* Provisional 2017 figures from 01January &ndash; 30 June.</p></reply>

This position has not changed. </p><p>In respect of increases to staff numbers based in Drogheda, as the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 25 of which have been assigned to Drogheda Garda Station.  A further 800 Garda recruits are expected to attest from the Garda College this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2017.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>In relation to Civilian personnel in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I am advised that it is the Commissioner&rsquo;s intention to allocate one additional Garda civilian staff (EO) to Drogheda with an expected commencement date of February 5<sup>th</sup>of this year. </p><p>In respect of other offices of the Department based in Drogheda there are no plans to increase existing staffing numbers.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Dublin Metropolitan (DMR) Divisions on 30 November 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, was 3,409 with 175 Garda Reserves and 254 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 719 of whom have been assigned to the DMR Divisions.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,552 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In additional, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR Divisions.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the Garda strength of the DMR  Divisions, in each of the years from 2014 to the 30 November 2017, that latest date for which figures are currently available is as set out in the following tables, as supplied by the Commissioner.</p><p><b>D.M.R.

This is also the case for &ldquo;Z Drugs&rdquo; such as Zopiclone (Zimovane), Zolpidem (Stilnoct) and Zaleplon (Sonata) meaning that it is now an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to 2016 to be in possession of these substances, even in amounts for personal use, without a valid prescription in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the details sought by the Deputy about the operation of the new Regulations since they came into force in May 2017.  I will revert to the Deputy with those details when the report is to hand.</p></reply>

In this context, I would point to the new national drugs and alcohol strategy, "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery" and the important role for communities signalled in action 4.1.41 which is concerned with enhancing the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities in relation to the impact of the drugs trade.  It is essential that there be proactive engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and businesses and that positive relationships are developed if this form of criminality is to be effectively tackled.</p></reply>

Information can, however, be provided for the years 2011 to end 2017 inclusive and is shown in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Applications<br /><br />Granted<br /><br />(to nearest '000)</td><td>13,000</td><td>23,000</td><td>29,000</td><td>18,000</td><td>11,000</td><td>10,000</td><td>7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Fees Received (&euro;'s m)</td><td>&euro;10.8</td><td>&euro;20</td><td>&euro;22.9</td><td>&euro;17.1</td><td>&euro;11.5</td><td>&euro;10</td><td>&euro;8.8</td></tr></table></p><p>It is not possible to provide a unit cost for the processing of citizenship applications.  Every application for naturalisation is considered on its own individual merits and in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Applications can vary significantly in the processing required to bring an application to a conclusion.  While most straightforward cases are generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p><p>The fees to be paid by an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation are governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 569 of 2011).  The prescribed application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and the prescribed certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950 (unchanged since 2008), while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  </p><p>The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Managing and dealing with incomplete applications consumes scarce processing resources and the application fee is designed to recoup some of the costs associated with the application process.  The application fee is also intended to help cover costs associated with the processing of unsuccessful applications that often consume more processing time and resources than successful applications.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced in 2011 at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.  </p><p>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department does not maintain any register or statistics of naturalised Irish citizens who are resident in the State.</p></reply>

The Designated Judge reports to the Taoiseach.  In carrying out her functions the Designated Judge has, by law, full access to all persons and records she considers relevant and all relevant persons have, by law, a duty to co-operate with her.</p>  <p>  In addition, a serving judge of the Circuit Court acts as the Complaints Referee.  He is empowered to receive and investigate complaints from persons who believe that their communications have been intercepted or their communications data accessed.  In carrying out his functions, the Designated Judge has, by law, full access to all persons and records he considers relevant to his investigations and all relevant persons have, by law, a duty to co-operate with him.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that section 12 of the 1993 Act restricts disclosure in respect of interception authorisations and it places a requirement on the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure that such arrangements are in place to limit to the minimum necessary for the purpose of the prevention or detection of serious offences or in the interests of the security of the State the disclosure of the fact that an authorisation has been given, and the contents of any communication which has been intercepted pursuant to an authorisation.  Therefore it is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose detail of any authorisations to intercept.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that in this regard I am maintaining the long-standing practice of my predecessors.  Nonetheless, I can assure him and the House, just as I did in response to his previous questions on this matter on 11 July 2017, that I have never exercised the legal powers available to me to interfere in any way with the work of Members of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that when he raised concerns in the media last December that the powers in law for interception and access to retained data may have been used in respect of him or other Members of the Oireachtas, and that senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were abusing these powers, I immediately arranged for his concerns to be brought to the attention of the Designated Judge and I understand that, in accordance with her powers in law, she will investigate his concerns independently.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall also that I wrote directly to him on 14 December 2017 setting out the position in respect of the concerns he had raised publicly that day, including inviting him to make a complaint to the Complaints Referee.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that on 3 October 2017 I published the draft scheme for a Communications (Retention of Data) Bill to replace the 2011 Act in order to take account of important decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union in this area of law.  Work on drafting that new Bill is ongoing.  In addition, my Department is also advancing work on detailed proposals to update the current law with regard to the lawful interception of communications.</p></reply>

Under that section the Legal Services Regulatory Authority shall, not later than eighteen months after its establishment day, commence a review of the operation of the 2015 Act. It must report its findings, conclusions and any recommendations arising from that review to each House of the Oireachtas within twelve months. Given that the establishment day of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority was 1 October 2016, the relevant deadline for the commencement of the first review of the operation of the 2015 Act will be the end of March 2018. Thereafter, such reviews will be conducted at three-yearly intervals. It is my understanding that the Regulatory Authority, which is independent in the performance of its functions, already has this matter under active consideration and will be addressing it at the appropriate time under the relevant terms of the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  I also understand that the Authority is putting the practical arrangements in place for the provision, on foot of appropriate public consultations, of the required statutory report in relation to the education and training (including ongoing training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners, including the manner in which such education and training is provided. This report, which has to be provided to me as Minister within two years of the Authority&rsquo;s establishment day, will cover an array of relevant matters set out within section 34 of the 2015 Act and will be laid before the Houses.</p>  <p>  More generally, I would also point out that under section 16 of the 2015 Act the Legal Services Regulatory Authority may, at its own discretion, establish committees to assist and advise it in relation to the performance of all or any of its functions.</p></reply>

This includes identifying and progressing any necessary remedial or refurbishment works required at individual stations.  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021, which is an ambitious 5 year Programme based on agreed Garda priorities continues to benefit over thirty locations around the country, including the provision of a Divisional property store at Naas Garda station.  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the OPW has advised works are at an early development stage and will be progressed over the timeframe of the programme.</p><p>I understand from the Garda authorities that in addition to the above Programme, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to address maintenance issues, including any refurbishment works, as they arise liaising closely with the OPW in this regard.  The progression of any scheme of works is subject to the funding available and the competing accommodation priorities within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>In that context, I have been informed that the following works are anticipated in Kildare:</p><p>- significant refurbishment works at Clane Garda station are nearing completion.  The works involved refurbishment to the public office, enhancements to welfare facilities, as well as general maintenance,</p><p>- the cells at Newbridge Garda station are to be upgraded in 2018 under the National Cell Refurbishment Programme,</p><p>- works to repair/refurbish welfare facilities at Kildare Garda station are due to commence this month, </p><p>- works are anticipated for the Garda stations at Maynooth, Kilcock, Naas, and Leixlip in 2018.</p></reply>

The Courts Service has advised that details of information relating to individuals have been redacted for data protection purposes.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the court poor box is a non-statutory system used by the District Courts to impose a financial charge on a defendant to be used for a charitable purpose, usually instead of imposing a criminal conviction.  The option of paying into the court poor box arises usually where the offence is minor in nature and would not attract a custodial sentence. </p>  <p>  There are many reasons and instances why the court poor box is used by judges.  The accused may never previously have been before the courts, the accused may have pleaded guilty, a conviction might be inappropriate, or might adversely affect employment, career or working abroad prospects, and/or the offence may be of a minor or trivial nature.  </p>  <p>  When combined with the Probation of Offenders Act it provides an option where some financial penalty is considered merited but a conviction and fine are not.  It can sometimes be a more meaningful punishment than the maximum fine where the value of a maximum fine may have been eroded by inflation. </p>  <p>  Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.</p>  <p>  The Government has approved the drafting of a Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is intended that the legislation will abolish the court poor box and replace it with a statutory Reparation Fund to provide for a fair, equitable and transparent system of reparation that will apply only to minor offences dealt with by the District Court.</p></reply>

The Irish Prison Service must accept all committals from the courts and does not have the option of refusing committals.  The determination of bail applications is a matter for the Judiciary.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Criminal Justice Act 2017, which was enacted on 28 June 2017, expands the factors which a court may take into account in refusing bail to include the extent to which the number and frequency of previous convictions by the accused for serious offences indicate persistent serious offending by him or her, and the likelihood of any danger to a person or the community that could be caused by the release on bail of the accused. </p>  <p>  However, a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions and the conduct of any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge. </p></reply>

I understand that the resourcing of each Garda Region and Division is fully considered within the overall context of the needs and requirements of Garda regions throughout the country. Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategies, are continually monitored and reviewed.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 2,400 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next three years in addition to the more than 2,000 who have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014 and the end of 2017. I am informed by the Commissioner that 807 Garda trainees entered the Garda College in 2017. </p><p>I am further informed that since the reopening of the Garda College just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 49 of whom have been assigned to the Kilkenny/Carlow Division. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,552 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 in 12 months. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In addition, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, which will see Garda numbers reach more than 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Kilkenny/Carlow Division.  </p></reply>

At that time Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 were commenced as necessary to get the new Authority appointed and under way. The Authority, which is independent in the performance of its functions under the 2015 Act, has convened regularly since its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 - minutes of its meetings are available on its website www.LSRA.ie. </p>  <p>  During its initial year of establishment, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority has been deeply engaged in the conduct of public consultations and in the making of five reports on a series of new options for the provision of legal services under sections 118 to 120 of the Act which were also commenced. It had been obliged to complete these within strictly set deadlines running from its day of establishment on 1 October 2016. All of these reports have now been laid, as required under the 2015 Act, before the Houses of the Oireachtas while also being publicly accessible on the Authority&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  As reflected in the 2015 Act and the relevant reports completed by the Authority, the Government continues to give policy priority to the introduction of Legal Partnerships by way of structural reform of the legal services sector. It is appreciated that this places additional working demands on the Authority which has, nonetheless, been consulting with the legal professional bodies and conducting workshops in preparation for their introduction.</p>  <p>  Alongside its ongoing consultation and reporting commitments, the current working focus of the Authority is, I understand, very much on the managed roll-out of its remaining functions. This includes the matching development of the organisational capacities and office and staffing resources essential to effective delivery. It also includes the necessary preparatory steps for the establishment and application of the new Roll of Practicing Barristers under which both Law Library and non-Law Library practicing barristers will be regulated, for the first time under legislation, by the Authority. This will also be a pre-requisite for the exercise by the Authority of its public complaints functions. A further key area under development is that of the application of the levy that is to be made on both practicing solicitors and practicing barristers under Part 7 of the 2015 Act. Funding support of &euro;1 million has recently been provided to the Authority from the Justice Vote for 2017. This follows an advance of the same amount that was provided from my Department&rsquo;s 2016 Vote.</p>  <p>  It should also be recalled that in parallel to the introduction of enhanced legal costs transparency obligations on legal practitioners under the 2015 Act, extensive legal and technical preparations are also continuing separately within the courts system to complete the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators. </p>  <p>  Following these steps, the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the 2015 Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers, will be commenced. It is considered that this component of the Act will underpin the entire new regulatory regime in terms of its observance and enforcement. I will, of course, continue to emphasise the importance which I attach as Minister to the objective of getting the Authority open for business on the core public complaints function as quickly as is reasonably possible while also bearing in mind the risks and complexities which must be carefully managed to bring that about.</p>  <p>  The Regulatory Authority is actively preparing to conduct the first periodic review of the operation of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as required under section 6 of that Act. This must be commenced not later than eighteen months after the Authority's establishment day and its outcomes reported to each House of the Oireachtas within twelve months. Moreover, the Authority is putting the practical arrangements in place for the provision, on foot of appropriate public consultations, of the required statutory report in relation to the education and training (including ongoing training) arrangements in the State for legal practitioners, including the manner in which such education and training is provided. This report, which has to be provided to me as Minister within two years of the Authority&rsquo;s establishment day, will cover an array of matters set out within section 34 of the 2015 Act and be laid before the Houses. </p>  <p>  Work has also commenced in preparation for the submission of the Authority's first three-year Strategic Plan under section 20 of the 2015 Act. The Authority will also be submitting its first full-year Annual Report having previously submitted a report for quarter three of 2016. Work is also ongoing between the Authority and my Department on a new Corporate Governance Assurance Agreement. Arrangements are also underway to fill, with the necessary approval of each House of the Oireachtas, a casual vacancy that has arisen on the Authority due to the appointment of an existing member to the judiciary.</p>  <p>  The Authority continues its work on a number of projects to assist in identifying the staffing needs and resources required to allow it to support the ongoing roll out of its functions to a structured and achievable timetable. This includes continued direct engagement between the Authority and my Department as well as between the Authority and other key stakeholders. This work has been augmented by the recent appointment by the Authority of its first full-time Chief Executive, Dr. Brian Doherty, along with its securing of enhanced office accommodation.</p>  <p>  Against this background of complex and competing working demands, both I and my Department will continue to work closely with the Authority to enable it to come into substantive regulatory mode at the earliest opportunity and with appropriate staffing and project management. I am also anticipating an early opportunity to engage further myself with the Authority to discuss progress in relation to these matters. At the same time, it will be appreciated that the Authority is earnestly working to progress the identification and elaboration, in conjunction with my Department, of the more specific delivery dates concerned.  I expect these will be made known as soon as they have been aligned, to the satisfaction of the Authority, with its anticipated working resources as an independent regulator.</p></reply>

A Section 18 Statement of Interests Form is attached as well as correspondence from the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO).</p>  <p>  Prior to 2010, SIPO guidelines recommended that where a designated official had no interests to disclose, he/she should furnish a 'nil' statement, however this was never a legal requirement. </p>  <p>  In the eighth edition of the guidelines (August 2010) for public servants on compliance with their obligations, SIPO withdrew  this recommendation. On this basis, I am informed that personnel were subsequently notified that it is no longer necessary to provide a &ldquo;nil&rdquo; statement and were informed that it was the responsibility of each holder of a "designated position of employment" to ensure that he/she was in compliance with their obligations under the Ethics in Public Office Acts. In this context it is obviously not possible for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (or any other public service body) to confirm with absolute certainty full historical compliance as the individuals had the option of not furnishing a statement. However, as the Deputy will be aware, following a request by the Public Accounts Committee last Summer, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requested all relevant officers to confirm compliance with the Ethics in Public Office Acts. This was done through a survey conducted by the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer. I am advised that a total of 272 members were surveyed and 271 members responded.  I understand that the remaining person was on extended sick leave.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that last December, Garda management met with officials from SIPO to discuss how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could enhance processes to ensure a robust approach to compliance with the Ethics in Public Office Acts. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner has advised that correspondence will shortly issue to relevant personnel with regard to compliance with the Acts for 2017 and that, in the interest of good corporate governance, they will be requested to confirm compliance with the Acts by returning a statement of interests whether it is "Nil" or otherwise.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a specific concern in relation to compliance with SIPO legislation, I would ask that he communicate the information to SIPO so that the matter can be properly investigated.</p></reply>

The civil appeals list is managed by the President of the Court of Appeal, while the criminal appeals list is managed by another judge of the court nominated by the President. </p><p>The Court sits every day in term in a minimum of two divisions to hear civil appeals and criminal appeals subject to one week each term being allocated for preparation of reserved judgments in cases, where important issues of law arise and where the court is of the view that judgment cannot be given immediately after the appeal hearing. </p><p>The Courts Service has advised that the waiting times as at the end of November 2017 were as follows:</p><p>(a) Civil Appeals</p><p>-  fast tracked short appeals (requiring less that 2 hours) - 12 months subject to the case being included in the &quot;short cases&quot; list and with the possibility of an earlier date, and</p><p>-  other appeals (requiring more than 2 hours) - the waiting time for these appeals is 18 months.  </p><p>Urgent appeals such as Hague Convention/child abduction and refugee asylum cases continue to be accommodated having regard to the degree of urgency demonstrated. Also civil appeals, which have a custody and/or criminal element, are now case-managed in the Criminal Courts of Justice by the panel of 4 judges assigned to deal with the criminal appeal list, thus ensuring the degree of priority necessary for hearing of such appeals. As a result, waiting times for these cases are as follows:</p><p>- Article 40/habeas corpus appeals and bail appeals are usually heard in one month or less </p><p>- European Arrest Warrant cases and Judicial Review cases are heard within the current legal term provided the necessary papers are in order. </p><p>(b) Criminal Appeals</p><p>Criminal Appeals have a waiting time of 6 months. This is significantly better than the 18 month waiting time in the Court of Criminal Appeal prior to the establishment of the Court of Appeal.  Hearing dates can now be allocated during the subsequent legal term to the majority of cases included in the List to Fix Dates (held once a term). An occasional case, which requires a full day or in excess of a day, or a case where for various reasons a date during a specific week/month is requested by the parties and which the court simply cannot accommodate due to the availability of court time, will be allocated a date during the subsequent term.  </p><p>Criminal appeals (and civil appeals for hearing in the Criminal Courts of Justice) are actively managed on a weekly basis by the Judge assigned to management of the criminal lists to ensure cases are dealt with as efficiently as possible and delays in moving cases to the List to Fix Dates due to procedural issues arising are kept to a minimum. Applications for priority may be made at the weekly management list.</p><p>The matter of resources in the Court of Appeal, taking into account its current workload including the substantial inherited backlog and bearing in mind resources across the courts, is currently being examined.</p><p>A recent initiative agreed between the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal has seen a first tranche of 60 legacy appeals (transferred from the Supreme Court) identified for transfer back to the Supreme Court with a view to an early hearing date in that court. 20 of these appeals have been transferred back to the Supreme Court and of these 9 appeals were heard in the Supreme Court in December 2017 with the remainder being actively case-managed by the Supreme Court with a view to a hearing in February 2018. </p></reply>

The data have been collated in relation to sittings of the District Court in WaterfordCity, Dungarvan and Lismore and is set out in the following table.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the court poor box is a non-statutory system used by the District Courts to impose a financial charge on a defendant to be used for a charitable purpose, usually instead of imposing a criminal conviction. The option of paying into the court poor box arises usually where the offence is minor in nature and would not attract a custodial sentence. </p><p>There are many reasons and instances why the court poor box is used by judges. The accused may never previously have been before the courts, the accused may have pleaded guilty, a conviction might be inappropriate, or might adversely affect employment, career or working abroad prospects, and/or the offence may be of a minor or trivial nature.  </p><p>When combined with the Probation of Offenders Act it provides an option where some financial penalty is considered merited but a conviction and fine are not. It can sometimes be a more meaningful punishment than the maximum fine where the value of a maximum fine may have been eroded by inflation. </p><p>Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.</p><p>The Government has approved the drafting of a Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system. The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It is intended that the legislation will abolish the court poor box and replace it with a statutory Reparation Fund to provide for a fair, equitable and transparent system of reparation that will apply only to minor offences dealt with by the District Court.</p><p>Report on Poor Box Orders for January to December 2016 for County Waterford<table><tr><th>Court Area</th><th>Number of Poor Box Orders</th></tr><tr><td>Waterford City</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Dungarvan</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Lismore</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>172</td></tr></table></p><p>The Courts Service has advised that it's financial procedures provide that payments to the court poor box are recorded on the Courts Service Courts Accounting System and that payments are receipted and accounted for on a Court Office basis rather than on an individual court location basis. Accordingly, it is not possible for the Courts Service to provide details in respect payments received arising from orders made in the courts sitting in Waterford City, Dungarvan or Lismore. </p></reply>

It was agreed at that time by both sides, the official side and the Garda representative associations, and endorsed by the then Minister for Finance, that the new arrangements should apply to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serving on, or after, 1 October 1976. By extension, these new terms did not and cannot apply to members who had left An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to that date. Generally speaking, these Agreed Reports provide that a Garda who resigned or was dismissed on or after 1 October 1976 can have superannuation benefits accrued to the date of resignation or dismissal, preserved until the member reached 60 years of age.  </p><p>The then Department of Finance, and now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which continues to have overall responsibility for public service pension matters, agreed with the proposals for a cut-off date for eligibility for preserved benefits.</p><p>Similar arrangements have also been introduced in pension schemes across the public sector with varying &lsquo;cut-off&rsquo; dates depending on the particular organisation involved and the conclusion of negotiations between management and the relevant staff interests. </p><p>I must again stress that this was an agreed date between all of the parties involved in the discussions and was not imposed. It is an inevitable consequence of the introduction of improvements in pension schemes that members of that scheme who had left it prior to the effective date cannot avail of that benefit. </p><p>My Department has consulted the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and has been advised that the position remains that it is not possible to resolve a case individually on an administrative basis and provide an individual with preserved benefits without changing the terms of the scheme retrospectively. Such amendment would, in equity, have to cover all public servants who resigned prior to the effective date applicable to their schemes.  That Department has further stated that changing the various schemes to change the cut-off date is not a practicable proposition.  </p><p>I am advised that if a person retired voluntarily with full pensionable service and having reached the minimum retirement age prior to 1 October 1976 their pension entitlement was not affected by the new terms, which applied from 1 October 1976.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter the President of the District Court and the presiding judge who are, under the constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the President of the District Court monitors waiting times and workload across all court lists and seeks to ensure the optimum use of court time and judicial resources. Wherever possible, the President targets additional judicial resources at the areas of greatest need. </p>  <p>  I am also informed that Wexford District Court hears family law applications on two dedicated days each month (second Monday and fourth Tuesday). There are also two dedicated days per month for the hearing of family law matters in Gorey District Court. In addition to these dedicated days, another day at the end of the month is available for hearings which are not reached on the normal family law court days. Special hearing days are also provided where deemed appropriate, especially for cases which may take some time to deal with. </p>  <p>  Emergency Applications such as Protection Orders are prioritised and are listed for hearing at the next court sitting day regardless of whether it is a dedicated family law day or not. Such applications are usually granted where the Court so decides on the date the application is made to the Court. Typically interim barring orders, which are also an emergency application, are also made ex parte and granted on the date of application. There are, therefore, no delays in dealing with such applications in either Wexford or Gorey District Courts.</p>  <p>  Barring Order and Safety Order applications are listed for the next dedicated family law day in both Wexford and Gorey District Courts and are allocated priority in the family law list for that dedicated day and it can reasonably be anticipated that such applications will be listed for hearing within 4 weeks of the date of application.  </p>  <p>  With regard to Guardianship or Maintenance applications the waiting time to get into Court is 6 to 8 weeks. Any applications requesting dates currently, unless they are urgent, are being assigned dates in February 2018.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that delays in the hearing of cases can be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are outside the control of the courts and the Courts Service, for example, the unavailability of a witness or vital evidence, delays in the furnishing of reports or because the parties and/or legal practitioners are not ready to proceed on allocated dates. This gives rise to adjournments, which can have an impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service continues to work with the Presidents and the Judiciary to ensure waiting times are kept to a minimum and, where specific issues are identified, resources are targeted at areas of greatest need.  </p></reply>

This accommodation is provided while their applications for international protection are being processed so a long term housing strategy for each individual would not be practicable as the decision on their application is not known at this stage.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, due to the urgent and unforeseen demand for accommodation, it was not possible to engage in a full consultation process with the local authority and the community. My Department has recently advertised a tender for Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres and also advertised in the national press and the Official Journal of the EU seeking expressions of interest from interested parties to provide accommodation to those seeking international protection.

The financial threshold at present is considered to be an income of &euro;50,000 per person per annum, plus the person must have access to a lump sum of money to cover any unforeseen major expenses. </p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process in October 2016  the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department undertook a review of this policy, with a view to bringing greater clarity and consistency to this area, and also to consider the economic factors involved.  This review has been finalised and decisions on foot of it will be made in the near future.  </p>  <p>  While it would be premature at this stage to outline the details of the proposed scheme I hope the Deputy will appreciate that it is reasonable that persons seeking to retire in the State should have a close association with Ireland, that they can fully support themselves while resident here, not become an undue burden on State services, and that they should be approved for this purpose before taking up residence.</p>  <p>  It is important to strike a reasonable balance between the aspirations of prospective non-EEA retirees and the interests of the State.  Accordingly, the key financial consideration in respect of a retiree, particularly those that have not paid tax in Ireland, or otherwise contributed to the Exchequer, is that the person must have sufficient and sustainable resources to ensure that they will not now or in the future become a burden on the State.</p></reply>

Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to dedicate very significant resources to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  However, I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime &ndash; under Operation Thor - has led to concentrated Garda activity resulting to date in over 100,000 targeted checkpoints and 85,000 crime prevention patrols nationwide. To give you an idea of the impact of the Operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,375 arrests and 7,134 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p><p>Very significant resources have been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in Budget 2018, to support large-scale policing operations including Operation Thor. It is also worth noting that Operation Thor has now entered its &lsquo;Winter Phase&rsquo; which will run from 29 October 2017 &ndash; 1 April 2018.</p><p>Operation Thor has targeted mobile criminal gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes and it is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend. The CSO official recorded crime statistics for 2016 show a decrease in burglary offences of 30% when compared to the previous twelve-month period in 2015.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.</p><p>I understand that work is ongoing to ensure that the publication of the official CSO crime statistics can recommence in earnest. Recent operational figures would appear to indicate that certain crime categories are on the rise, but until such time as the CSO can resume its publication of the crime statistics it would be unwise to draw any firm conclusions from them at this point.<b></b>However, I was pleased to note a Garda press release earlier this week which stated that, according to provisional figures, burglaries nationally fell by 23% during November and December under the Winter Phase of Operation Thor. Needless to say, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends and deploy their resources accordingly.</p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p><p>On 02 January 2018 I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017. The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The new funding has been allocated to the 2017 scheme and the deadline has been extended to 31 January 2018.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is www.muintir.ie.</p><p>Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.1429.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600083#WRY04300"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving, including drink-driving, more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that road traffic legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr Shane Ross, T.D.  I am, however, informed that the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 will address an issue in the legislation on drink-driving which has existed since 2010, whereby the Road Traffic Act 2010, which lowered the permissible alcohol limit while driving, allowed people convicted of driving while in the lowest bracket over the limit to receive 3 penalty points instead of a disqualification, subject to certain circumstances.  The current Bill proposes to replace these penalty points with a 3-month disqualification, thus communicating the critical message that &lsquo;a little drink-driving&rsquo; is a serious matter.  Evidence shows that, even at low levels, alcohol can impair people&rsquo;s ability to drive and can dull their reactions.  The Bill is currently at second stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and my colleague, Minister Ross, is committed to concluding the Bill's passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible. </p><p>Road safety is a shared responsibility, one which the Government takes very seriously.  Ireland's current Road Safety Strategy (2013 - 2020) aims to place Ireland consistently on the list of safest countries in the EU and beyond. To achieve this, we are continuing to work together in partnership with all relevant stakeholders.  I attend meetings of the Ministerial Committee on Road Safety, along with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Road Safety Authority (RSA), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General and other agencies. This Committee met 6 times last year and oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy, providing a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues and the opportunity to address road safety trends as they arise. </p><p>Last year witnessed the lowest number of annual road traffic fatalities on record (159) and it is imperative that the positive momentum across road traffic enforcement and road safety initiatives is harnessed towards further annual reductions in fatalities for the remainder of the life of the Road Safety Strategy. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na benefited from considerable resource investment by this Government in 2017, which has contributed to the most welcome downward trend in road traffic fatalities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the RSA continue to seek and avail of new opportunities to communicate with all road users and it is evident, from last year's figures, that many road users are heeding road safety campaigns and are increasingly aware of the importance of responsible driving behaviour. </p><p>This multi-agency approach continues into enforcement. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertakes a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies. Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including driving while intoxicated.  By working together with the RSA and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour thorough public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership. I am informed that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through specific enforcement operations. The recruitment of an additional 150 Gardai to the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau this year will contribute to a stronger road traffic enforcement capability nationwide. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also intend to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore and this will have a positive impact on enforcement and, as a result, safety on our roads. The Deputy will appreciate that I have no direct role in the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the lifetime of the Programme. Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.<b></b>The Programme is being supported by significant Government investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p><p>A key to achieving this goal is the commitment to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 21,000 by 2021.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  In addition, there are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.  </p><p>In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period vehicles to ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  In addition, the Government&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles to ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. This major investment will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  </p><p>The road traffic enforcement function performed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is one of its core functions and this Government is committed to further supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.</p></reply>

The average number of new protection applications per week was 56 in 2017, with an average of 244 per month.  To cope with the demand for accommodation from international protection applications, RIA reopened two former accommodation centres in late 2017. </p>  <p>  The management of each centre are required to submit a weekly register to RIA which gives details of the persons who are on site.  Management of a centre have experiential knowledge of whether a person is using their accommodation as they meet directly with residents on a daily basis (eg at meal times or the collection and delivery of post) and link with residents in the provision of services. </p>  <p>  When it comes to RIA's attention that a resident does not appear to be using their bed space consistently and the person has not given centre management an explanation as to why this is the case, RIA staff liaise with centre management to manage the situation.  In a case where RIA is satisfied that accommodation is not being used consistently, the resident will be issued a letter advising them that if they do not use their bedspace, that space will be re-allocated to another applicant in need. If the resident continues to be absent from their accommodation, a letter will be sent to them (at that centre), advising them that their bedspace has been deemed abandoned and will be reallocated to another protection applicant.  This letter will be held by management until the person presents in the centre to collect their post. </p>  <p>  It is open to residents to respond to the initial letter and provide any evidence that they are indeed availing of the accommodation. If RIA is satisfied that this is the case then the matter will be closed at that stage and the accommodation will not be reallocated.  Once the final letter is issued advising the resident that the bedspace has been deemed abandoned then any complaint will not be suspensive.  However, they resident can, if they choose, apply in writing to RIA asking to be re-accommodated.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that in early 2017, the remit of both the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children was extended to residents in accommodation centres under contract to my Department.</p></reply>

However, the Courts Service has provided the following provisional data, which is not expected to change substantially.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has informed me that during the course of 2017 a total of 2,782 new cases were initiated in private family law proceedings in the Dublin District Court. These are cases where proceedings between litigants were initiated in the Dublin District Court for the first time during 2017. In addition, during the course of the year, the court issued a total of 14,842 new summons related to such proceedings. These summonses relate not only to the new cases initiated during the course of 2017 but also to historic cases initiated in previous years where new applications related thereto came before the Court during 2017. Private family law proceedings generally relate to domestic violence cases and applications for custody, access, guardianship and maintenance matters. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that in relation to public family law (childcare proceedings) a total of 117 new cases were lodged with the Dublin District Court during 2017. These are cases where proceedings were initiated in the Dublin District Court for the first time during 2017. In addition, a total of 3,151 applications were dealt with by the Court during 2017 including applications for extension of interim care orders. These applications relate not only to the new cases initiated during the course of 2017 but also to historic cases initiated in previous years where new applications related thereto came before the Court during 2017.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further informed me that during the course of 2017 a total of 2,411 new cases were initiated in the Dublin Circuit Family Law Court. These are cases where proceedings between litigants were initiated in the Dublin Circuit Family Law Court for the first time during 2017. The data provided includes 1,212 divorce civil bills, 424 judicial separation civil bills, 155 marriage exemption applications and a total of 490 new appeals received from the District Court.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>The Garda strength of the Kerry Division on 30 November 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, was 314 of whom 8 were community Garda&iacute;.  There are 20 Garda Reserves and 36 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on reaching this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 26 of whom have been assigned to the Kerry Division. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,552 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, which will see Garda numbers reach more than 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kerry Division.</p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  Community policing is not, of course, confined to dedicated Community Garda&iacute;, all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published in June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  </p><p>Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance Garda visibility within our communities and the provision of effective community policing across all Garda Divisions including the Kerry Division. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy as provided by the Commissioner is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th colspan="9">Community Garda&iacute; in   Kerry Division 2011-2017</th></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2011</td><td></td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>6</td><td></td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Killarney</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>9</td><td></td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr></table>*As of 30 November 2017.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.1458.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600084#WRZ00800"><p>I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime. Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to dedicate very significant resources to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  However, I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime &ndash; under Operation Thor - has led to concentrated Garda activity resulting to date in over 100,000 targeted checkpoints and 85,000 crime prevention patrols nationwide. To give you an idea of the impact of the Operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,375 arrests and 7,134 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p><p>Very significant resources have been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in Budget 2018, to support large-scale policing operations including Operation Thor. It is also worth noting that Operation Thor has now entered its &lsquo;Winter Phase&rsquo; which will run from 29 October 2017 &ndash; 1 April 2018.</p><p>Operation Thor has targeted mobile criminal gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes and it is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend. The CSO official recorded crime statistics for 2016 show a decrease in burglary offences of 30% when compared to the previous twelve-month period in 2015.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.</p><p>I understand that work is ongoing to ensure that the publication of the official CSO crime statistics can recommence in earnest. Recent operational figures would appear to indicate that certain crime categories are on the rise, but until such time as the CSO can resume its publication of the crime statistics it would be unwise to draw any firm conclusions from them at this point.<b></b>However, I was pleased to note a Garda press release earlier this week which stated that, according to provisional figures, burglaries nationally fell by 23% during November and December under the Winter Phase of Operation Thor. Needless to say, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends and deploy their resources accordingly.</p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p><p>On 02 January 2018 I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017. The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The new funding has been allocated to the 2017 scheme and the deadline has been extended to 31 January 2018.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is www.muintir.ie.</p><p>Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p></reply>

This Convention is a significant legal instrument in tackling violence against women and domestic violence. Many of the actions required by provisions in the Istanbul Convention are being implemented on a daily basis under current legislation and administrative practice. The actions necessary to ratify the Istanbul Convention are contained in the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, published in January, 2016. </p>  <p>  The implementation of most of these actions is underway including public sector training/education by a range of State agencies, the development of a Risk Assessment Matrix by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, commissioning of a national helpline service to respond to issues of domestic and sexual violence, and support for child witnesses. </p>  <p>  The remaining outstanding actions are legislative and require delivery of two pieces of legislation: </p>  <p>  i) The Domestic Violence Bill which was published on 3 February 2017. The Bill has passed all stages in the Seanad and Second Stage in the D&aacute;il. Committee stage is expected to commence shortly in the D&aacute;il. It is hoped that this Bill will be enacted early this year. The enactment of this legislation is key to advancing the ratification of the Istanbul Convention as its enactment will deliver four of the actions required under the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  ii) The one remaining legislative action is the enactment of legislation for extraterritorial jurisdiction. Work on this action is underway and it is anticipated that this legislation will be published in the first half of 2108.  </p>  <p>  When the required legislative actions are implemented, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Convention.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the total strength of the Roads Policing Units on the 30 November 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 643. In addition, there is a Superintendent and Traffic Inspector attached to each of the five Regions outside of the Dublin Metropolitan Region, and one Superintendent attached to the Policing Road Traffic Bureau. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,552 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including roads policing in the coming years.  </p><p>The Commissioner committed in the Policing Plan for 2017 to increase incrementally the number of personnel dedicated to roads policing  by 10% to support better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement and crime prevention. </p><p>In this regard the Commissioner has confirmed that a review of the roads policing has been completed and a new role and job description for additional personnel for Road Policing Units has been developed. I am advised that a competition to fill vacancies within Traffic Corps units is ongoing at present. At the conclusion of this competition, additional personnel will be allocated to Traffic Corps duties.<b></b></p><p>Personnel strength of the Garda Traffic Corps 2008-2017<table><tr><th>Division</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

One of the main statutory functions of the PSRA is the licensing of Property Service Providers, i.e. auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents. The Authority is independent in exercising its statutory functions.</p>  <p>  Part 11 and Schedule 7 of the 2011 Act relate to property services provided by certain persons from EU Member States referred to in the legislation as 'relevant persons'. Section 82 of the 2011 Act details a 'relevant person' as: one who holds from an EU competent authority a licence, or other form of authorisation, authorising that person to provide a property service similar to the definition provided for in the 2011 Act; is subject to a scheme of protection in respect of client accounts that substantially corresponds to the provisions of Part 5 of the Act; proposes to provide, or is providing, a corresponding property service in the State; and is not prohibited under the Act from providing the corresponding property service. The requirement to allow 'relevant persons' to provide property services in the State without a licence from the Property Services Regulatory Authority is a requirement of EU law, arising from our obligations under the EU Services Directive 2006/123/EC.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission has indicated that it has concerns about certain provisions of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, which may contravene certain aspects of the Services Directive. These relate to the provision of property services by persons other than 'relevant persons' who are permitted to provide property services in their own jurisdictions without a requirement to hold a relevant licence or authorisation. In the light of this concern, and in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, my Department is considering whether changes may need to be made to certain provisions of the current legislation.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>The Garda strength of the Kildare Division on 30 November 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, was 352 with 20 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 80  have been assigned to the Kildare Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,552 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Kildare Division.  </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Kildare Division in each of the years 2010 to 30 November 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is set out in the following table.</p><p>Personnel Strength of the Kildare Division by Station 2010 - 2017<table><tr><th>DISTRICT</th><th>STATION</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>ATHY</td><td>29</td><td>31</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYTORE</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEDERMOT</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILDARE</td><td>33</td><td>26</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONASTEREVIN</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWBRIDGE           </td><td>45</td><td>47</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHANGAN           </td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>120</td><td>117</td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>LEIXLIP</td><td>CARBURY</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CELBRIDGE           </td><td>18</td><td>17</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCOCK</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LEIXLIP</td><td>35</td><td>34</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAYNOOTH</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>80</td><td>77</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>NAAS</td><td>BALLYMORE EUSTACE</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLANE</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCULLEN           </td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILL</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NAAS</td><td>101</td><td>101</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROBERTSTOWN</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>123</td><td>124</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILDARE TOTAL</td><td>323</td><td>318</td><td>318</td></tr></table>*Up to 30 November 2017.</p></reply>

The next step will be for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring forward a Memorandum for Government on the formal ratification process which will happen in the coming weeks. We are awaiting final confirmation from the AG on whether a D&aacute;il resolution will be required &ndash; and if it is, this will be a welcome opportunity for debate in the House on the position of people with disabilities in our society and the importance of this convention.</p>  <p>  The Government also approved the publication of draft legislation relating to deprivation of liberty for public consultation. The draft legislative provisions outline proposed safeguards for older people, persons with a disability and certain categories of people with mental health issues to ensure that they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in residential facilities.</p>  <p>  Deprivation of liberty is a sensitive and important matter which goes to the heart of fundamental freedoms and human rights. Legislative proposals in this area will have significant implications for families, the operation of the health services and the courts. It is important that people fully understand what is being proposed. For this reason, Minister Harris and I are inviting submissions from stakeholders and the general public by way of public consultation up until March before these are finalised for drafting by the AG&rsquo;s Office.</p>  <p>  This Government is making good progress with regard to making the Convention&rsquo;s requirements operational in Ireland in an appropriate matter. Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s full implementation of the Convention as set out in the 2015 roadmap. </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform on the law of decision&ndash;making capacity. Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was reformed through a 2017 Act of the same name to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  There are two further priority implementation issues: these are the enactment of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making Capacity Act 2015 which requires the Decision Support Service to be operational and ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The 2018 Budget has provided an allocation of &euro;3 million for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  The future allocations of resources are matters for each annual Budget and are for the individual Departments involved.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am continuing to take a wide range of practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities. The Report of the &lsquo;Make Work Pay Group&rsquo; was published in April of last year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris, has been taken on its recommendations.</p>  <p>  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and 2017 saw positive action measures being taken to support public service recruitment of people with disabilities. I also published the Disability Inclusion Strategy in July of last year, which contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the lives of people with disabilities.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.

To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b></b></p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of personnel assigned to Rathfarnham Garda Station in each of the years 2015 to 30 November 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the following table.</p><p>Strength of Rathfarnham Garda Station 2015-2017<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>2017*</td><td>60</td></tr></table>*Up to 30 November 2017.</p></reply>

Commissions of Investigation are set up by Government order and approved by both Houses. Terms of Reference are agreed which usually contain the likely duration and cost of the Commission.</p>  <p>  In relation to this proposed Commission, the Government decided, in May 2017, to announce an intention to establish the Commission, once all outstanding legal matters were finalised. This decision was based on the legal advice received, which indicated that there could be severe delays if the Commission were to be established at that time. These delays, it was indicated, would be due to a number of outstanding legal matters, including ongoing investigations relating to further offences allegedly committed by Bill Kenneally, and a concern that evidence, adduced at the Commission, may impact upon future prosecutions. Mr Kenneally is also appealing against the severity of his sentence.</p>  <p>  The Government decision of May 2017 to establish the Commission of Investigation, but defer the commencement of its work until the outstanding legal matters were resolved, was communicated to the solicitor for the individuals who had been seeking the Commission. This communication took place on the same day that the Government decision was made.</p>  <p>  I can inform you that this Government remains focused on uncovering the truth of what happened in this case. </p>  <p>  I have committed to working with the office of the Attorney General to identify a clear, workable, legally sound path to the establishment of a Commission. A meeting has been arranged between officials from the AGs office and my Department to identify a method to allow for the early establishment of the Commission, in such a way as not to prejudice the ongoing criminal investigations.</p></reply>

This has always been the case. When the Government decided, in May 2017, to announce the intention to establish the Commission, this was based on legal advice from the then Attorney General that indicated there would be severe delays if the Commission were to be established at that time. The decision was made based on a number of outstanding legal matters, including ongoing investigations into further offences, and a concern that evidence, adduced at a Commission, may impact upon future prosecutions. </p>  <p>  Various proposals have been made as to how a Commission of Investigation may be able to operate in this context and they are being fully explored.  I have had a preliminary discussion with the Attorney General regarding this matter and have arranged to work with officials from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to identify a methodology to allow for the early establishment of the Commission of Investigation, in such a way as not to prejudice the ongoing criminal investigations. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the pain and suffering that has been endured by the victims. Once a clear, workable, legally sound path to the establishment of the Commission is agreed with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, I will meet with the victims, and their legal representative, at the earliest possible opportunity to brief them on the new proposals and to hear their thoughts.</p></reply>

Accordingly, projected numbers cannot be estimated. However, I can say that all applicants are offered immediate shelter, full board accommodation and a range of services such as health and education while their application for international protection is being processed.</p><p>Not every person who seeks international protection in Ireland chooses to accept this offer and many chose to live with colleagues, family or friends in communities across the country, as they are entitled to do. </p><p>In terms of the commitments made by the State, the Government established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) in September 2015 as part of the State&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the migration crisis in Southern Europe. The State agreed to accept up to 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees overall into Ireland under relocation and resettlement programmes at the earliest time possible. Ireland voluntarily opted into the two EU Council Decisions on Relocation (2015/1523) and (2015/1601), which provided for the relocation of 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece. </p><p>By early 2018, Ireland will have admitted its entire cohort from Greece under the relocation programme (1,089) and will have admitted 1,040 persons under the European Commission&rsquo;s July 2015 Resettlement scheme - double our original commitment of 520 under that scheme. The European Commission recognises Ireland as being one of only seven EU Member States to have fulfilled their resettlement pledges from the July 2015 Agreement. </p><p>By the end of the two-year EU Relocation Programme in September 2017, overall, a total of 37,000 asylum seekers were eligible and registered for relocation in Italy and Greece, of which 78% (approximately 29,000) had been relocated to other EU Member States including Ireland.</p><p>To address the balance of approximately 1,800 people under the IRPP, additional resettlement pledges have been made for 2018 and 2019 and a new Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) is being established.</p><p>The following tables set out the numbers that are currently accommodated by County in Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) centres, and in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROC) for those arriving to Ireland under our International Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).  The overall numbers include those awaiting determination of the international protection application, those granted status as a discretionary measure to assist them to transition to mainstream housing and those issued with deportation orders who are obliged to remove themselves from the State. </p><p>As a result of an increasing number of applicants seeking international protection and other factors, existing centres are virtually at full capacity. Accordingly, expressions of interest for additional accommodation facilities are currently being sought. The outcome of this process will determine where any additional centres will be located.  </p><p><b>Reception and Integration Centres</b><table><tr><th><div>County                              </div></th><th><div>Current Occupancy</div></th></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>                        238</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>787</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>                                  838</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>                                   341</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>                                     341</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>                                     83</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td><div>                                    194</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>                               200</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td><div>                                  77</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>                                    45</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>                                  236</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>                                     603</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>                               159</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td><div>                                      204</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td><div>                                111</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>                                 399</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>                               268</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td><div>5,124</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>EROC Centres</b><table><tr><th><div>County                           </div></th><th><div>Current Occupancy </div></th></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>114</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>112</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td><div>170</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>193</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td><div>589</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

While I did not receive the information referred to, I can assure the Deputy that if he wishes to forward the relevant information, I will arrange for officials in my Department to discuss the matter with the relevant officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are responsible for crime prevention. I would also welcome any further input the Deputy may wish to provide. </p>  <p>  I am aware, however, that there are a number of initiatives operating in Ireland, in particular Theftstop, which may be of interest to you and your constituents. </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Theftstop&rdquo; is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID and then registered on a nationwide database. The clearly visible serial number should act as a deterrent to criminals. A further impediment for criminals is that the details and serial numbers of stolen equipment can be viewed by would-be buyers on-line at www.theftstop.ie.</p>  <p>  I also consider it important to state that there is an onus on farmers, and others, seeking to buy farm machinery or equipment, to ensure that the items they are purchasing are not stolen. I would encourage everyone to check the register on the theftstop website. If the demand does not exist for stolen farm machinery, the levels of theft in the industry are sure to fall.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I would also encourage the public to mark machinery and other similar items with their own unique Eircode. This will expedite the retrieval, identification and return of any recovered stolen property to them, and act as a further deterrent against theft.</p></reply>

All applications are assessed on the basis of the date on which they are lodged, an approach which provides fairness and equity to all applicants. However, where any personal applicant signals a particular urgency regarding their circumstances, the Probate Office endeavours to expedite the application in question. </p>  <p>  The backlogs in the probate system are an ongoing cause for concern and a review of the probate system is being carried out at present. The report with recommendations for the modernisation of the process is now being finalised and will be presented to the Senior Management Team of the Courts Service and to the Courts Service Board early this year. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Courts Service has assigned additional staff resources to the Probate Office to assist in dealing with the high volume of work of the Office and this is expected to result in an improvement in timeframes for all applications, including Personal Applicant applications.</p></reply>

The next step will be for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring forward a Memorandum for Government on the formal ratification process which will happen in the coming weeks. As of now, we are awaiting final confirmation from the Attorney General on whether a D&aacute;il resolution will be required &ndash; and if it is, this will be a welcome opportunity for debate in the House on the position of people with disabilities in our society and the importance of this convention.</p>  <p>  The Government also approved the publication of draft legislation relating to deprivation of liberty for public consultation. The draft legislative provisions outline proposed safeguards for older people, persons with a disability and certain categories of people with mental health issues to ensure that they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in residential facilities.</p>  <p>  Deprivation of liberty is a sensitive and important matter which goes to the heart of fundamental freedoms and human rights. Legislative proposals in this area will have significant implications for families, the operation of the health services and the courts. It is important that people fully understand what is being proposed. For this reason, Minister Harris and I are inviting submissions from stakeholders and the general public by way of public consultation up until March before these are finalised for drafting.</p>  <p>  This Government is making good progress with regard to making the Convention&rsquo;s requirements operational in Ireland in an appropriate and timely matter. Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s full implementation of the Convention as set out in the 2015 roadmap. </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision- Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform on the law of decision &ndash; making capacity. Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was reformed through a 2017 Act of the same name to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  There are two further priority implementation issues: these are the enactment of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making Capacity Act 2015 which requires the Decision Support Service to be operational and ready to roll out the new &ndash;decision making support options. The 2018 Budget has provided an allocation of &euro;3 million for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am continuing to take a wide range of practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities. The Report of the &lsquo;Make Work Pay Group&rsquo; was published in April of last year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations.</p>  <p>  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and 2017 saw positive action measures being taken to support public service recruitment of people with disabilities. I also published the Disability Inclusion Strategy in July of last year containing wide range of practical commitments to improve the lives of people with disabilities.</p></reply>

These programmes can offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible and have access to use the services, both first time and repeat offenders.  The intention of this focussed approach is to assist persons committed to custody in living law-abiding and purposeful lives on their release to the community.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards . Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the Education and Training Boards and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, prisoners centred and which facilitates lifelong learning. The partnership endeavours to meet the needs of prisoners through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University. There is an increasing focus on Quality and Qualification Ireland "QQI" accreditation as the modular structure best meets the needs of students in prison.  On some occasions, prisoners may have to wait for a place to become available on an educational programme. A small number of refusals are issued each year for Open University where the applicants did not meet the Open University's eligibility criteria, however in all cases they were directed to continue to engage with the Education Centre and were encouraged in the direction of other more suitable rehabilitative programmes.</p></reply>

In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I must also consider all relevant constitutional and international human rights arising including those enshrined in the Refugee Convention, the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Charter of Human Rights. The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or non refoulment as it is referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order. This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p><p>A deportation order requires the person concerned to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.</p><p>It is to be noted that the enforcement of deportation orders is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).</p><p><b>Total Number of Deportations effected from 2013 to date *</b><table><tr><th>2013</th><th>209 </th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>114 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>251</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>428 </td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>140 </td></tr><tr><td>2018 (up to 15/1/2018)</td><td>6</td></tr></table>* Please note that it is not possible to differentiate between criminals and non criminals.</p></reply>

It would appear that as of today, this situation remains.</p>  <p>  Regarding regularisation of their status, the person concerned should, without delay, write directly to Unit 2, Residence Division, INIS and include an outline of their history in the State and that of any spouse, partner, children or any other dependents. They should also include full copies of passports, marriage certificate and birth certificates, if applicable. Upon receipt of this information, their situation will be fully assessed. </p>  <p>  From the limited details provided, it appears that the person concerned may never have had permission to remain in the State and they should be aware that it is illegal for them, under the Immigration Act 2004, to remain in the State without the permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality. A person found guilty of such an offence is liable, under Section 13 of the Immigration Act 2004, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. In addition, it is apparent that the person concerned has failed to meet the requirements of Section 9 of the Immigration Act 2004, which sets out the obligations of non-nationals in respect of registration.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The allocation of additional and support staff for the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau is ongoing. In addition, in conjunction with the Garda College, a module on cyber crime investigation is included in the training programme for all trainee Garda&iacute;, with all other Garda personnel being trained through the Continuous Professional Development network in cyber crime awareness and cyber crime investigation. </p>  <p>  The GCCB has responsibility for the forensic examination of all seized computer media, international liaison with regard to cyber matters and the investigation of cyber crime matters. Cases examined by the GCCB include all crime-types, in particular banking and financial crime matters, as well as the examination of equipment and media to assess images in the context of offences relating to child pornography and exploitation. </p>  <p>  The roll-out continues on a phased basis of regional triage units. The triage model provides a tiered response and capability for computer forensic services on a regional basis, utilising locally-based and trained first-responders and cyber triage specialists. The triage model also reduces demands on the central Bureau, while remaining under the supervision of the Detective Superintendent, Garda Cyber Crime Bureau. To date two regional triage units have been established in the Southern and South-Eastern Regions, at Ballincollig and New Ross Garda Stations. These triage units are the subject of review to inform and establish best practices and processes for the establishment of further such units in other Regions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is also being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.</p>  <p>  As of the 30 November 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available,  the number of staff allocated to the GCCB is 28 including 1 Inspector, 5 Sergeants and 17 Garda&iacute;, with 1 Higher Executive Officer, 2 Executive Officers and 2 Clerical Officers.</p></reply>

The WRC&rsquo;s responsibilities relate to the enforcement of the Employment Permits Acts and employment rights legislation generally, including minimum wage legislation. The HSA is the enforcement agency under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and conducts inspections under health and safety legislation at all places of work, including fishing vessels while docked in harbour.  It does not carry out inspections of fishing vessels at sea even when operating within Irish territorial waters. </p><p>The Marine Survey Office under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has lead responsibility for fishing vessel safety, security and living and working conditions. It is responsible for enforcing legislation in this context for seafarers and fishing vessel crew.</p><p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific enquiries, it is the case that ten WRC inspectors have undergone the relevant safety and survival training and are available for assignment on fisheries inspections and investigations. These inspectors also undertake enforcement operations in other employment sectors and are not, therefore, fully dedicated to work in the fishing sector.</p><p>Some 181 vessels on the Irish Fishing Vessel Register come within the scope of the Atypical Worker Permission Scheme for non-EEA Workers, with 174 of these vessels being active or operational at present. To date, 165 of these vessels have been inspected by the WRC. In total, some 240 inspections of these vessels were undertaken by the WRC in the period July, 2016 to 31st December, 2017.</p><p>202 contraventions were detected by WRC Inspectors to the end of 2017. Details of these contraventions are set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Contravention</th><th>No Detected</th></tr><tr><td>Failure   to keep employment records</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Non-EEA   fisher did not have permission to work</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Failure   to issue payslips</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Failure   to comply with an Inspector&rsquo;s requirement</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Failure   to compensate for Sunday working</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Failure   to comply with terms of Atypical Scheme</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Failure   to grant Public Holiday entitlements</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Failure   to grant annual leave entitlements</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Failure   to pay correct rates</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p><p>Some 112 contravention notices have been issued to date by the WRC. These notices advise vessel owners of contraventions detected and of the actions required, within a specified deadline, to effect compliance, including the payment of any unpaid wages arising from contraventions. Failure to respond to the contravention notice and/or to effect compliance may result in the issue of compliance notices and/or fixed payment notices, depending on the nature of the contravention and, ultimately, the initiation of prosecution proceedings. To date, the WRC has secured one successful prosecution while proceedings have been initiated in four other cases.</p><p>Current investigations by the WRC have been completed in respect of 95 of the 181 vessels. Five of those cases involved unpaid wages, amounting to almost &euro;6,300. The majority of the unpaid wages related to failure to pay National Minimum Wage rates and/or Public Holiday entitlements.</p></reply>

The number of Orders granted by the District Court in the course of 2016 was more than double the number of waivers granted by the Registrar in 2014 under the previous scheme. </p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 repeals section 343(7) of the Companies Act 2014.  A new section 343A provides that a company may apply to the District Court for an Order waiving the fee required for the late filing of its annual return. This is similar to the position that obtained before the enactment of the Companies Act 2014, whereby a company could apply to the Registrar but that decision now falls within the remit of the District Court. </p>  <p>  The loss of audit exemption where an annual return is not filed on time was introduced as a policy response for such failure in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003. The loss of audit exemption has proved central to creating a culture of compliance and acting as a support to good corporate governance practices. Today the compliance level is at 90%.  </p>  <p>  Companies have a considerable period of time, up to 10 months, to prepare and file their financial statements. The vast majority of companies manage to file within this timeframe.  Any further delay risks making that information less meaningful to the third parties concerned. </p>  <p>  This is an important consideration as those third parties may also be small companies that supply or otherwise do business with that company.  Given the time allowed to companies to prepare their financial statements, the fact that the financial reporting obligation has been simplified and reduced in the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 and that this Act also made more companies eligible for the audit exemption, I consider that the proposals in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 are appropriate. </p></reply>

This includes efforts to help businesses plan and prepare for the specific challenges that Brexit is likely to pose to their commercial activity. Much of our broader work so far to help mitigate the impact of Brexit on Irish firms is captured in my Department's recently published response paper to the UK's impending exit from the EU, entitled "Building Stronger Business - Responding to Brexit by Competing, Innovating and Trading". This paper summarises the policy measures already taken, outlines future initiatives we intend to take forward and details the steps the Department has taken already to ensure that we can work as efficiently as possible to support our companies. </p>  <p>  Our State Agencies have been very active in helping businesses prepare for the post-Brexit commercial environment and this work is ongoing. InterTradeIreland itself, for example, has introduced an initiative to assist SMEs, including the provision of expert advice on Brexit. It has also organised an extensive series of awareness raising events in various locations, both North and South. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland, meanwhile, has launched a "Brexit SME Scorecard" - effectively a new interactive platform which can be used by Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. The Agency has also introduced a "Be Prepared Grant" that helps SME clients meet the costs of implementing a plan to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. Furthermore, the Local Enterprise Office Network are hosting information events around the country aimed at helping companies plan for Brexit.</p></reply>

In addition to Parts dealing with the consolidation and updating of the law on the supply of goods, digital content and services and on unfair contract terms, the draft Scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers, including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers. The responses to the gift card provisions raised a substantial number of issues, including concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates and the need for clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011. However, I wish to repeat a willingness by previous Ministers to listen to other views and possible approaches to the issue of gift vouchers, such as a requirement that they remain valid for a set period.  </p>  <p>  While I am anxious to progress the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for Directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods. These proposals which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill. Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a general approach reached at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in June 2017. The proposal will now be considered in a trilogue with the European Parliament during 2018. Discussion at Council level on the second proposal on online sales has only just commenced.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am considering the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process. The wisdom of introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2018, if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time, is obviously open to question. However, I will continue to review the progress of the two European Union proposals with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the very useful information for consumers on the issue of gift vouchers on the CCPC website www.ccpc.ie.</p></reply>

To help achieve this goal, the Government has committed to providing the IDA &euro;150 million over five years for a regional property programme. This programme aims to ensure property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging more FDI in regional Ireland. </p>  <p>  To date, under the programme, the Agency has delivered advance buildings in Waterford, Athlone, Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee. It has also successfully secured tenants for the first buildings completed in Waterford, Athlone and Sligo. Two new buildings in Castlebar and Tralee are now complete and being marketed extensively. Construction is also underway on another facility in Galway.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is continuing to roll out its building programme across the country with new buildings planned in Carlow, Dundalk, Limerick, Athlone and Waterford over the next two years.</p></reply>

The Agency continues to work towards its goal, set out in its current strategy, of increasing investment in every region by 30%-40% by 2019.  </p>  <p>  Laois is marketed by IDA as part of the Midlands Region, which also comprises counties Westmeath, Offaly and Longford.  There are 34 multinational companies based in the Midlands - two of which are in Laois - employing a total 4,327 people.  In 2017, a total of 119 people were employed in IDA client companies in Laois, representing a slight increase on the 2016 total of 115.  </p>  <p>  Site visits represent one tool through which the IDA has sought to encourage more investment in Laois.  There were two such visits to the County in the first nine months of 2017.  Details on the total number of site visits in 2017 will be available in February 2018.  </p>  <p>  The availability of property solutions for prospective investors remains important in helping to attract FDI to a particular region or County.  In respect of Laois, the IDA has developed an 18-hectare Business and Technology Park in Portlaoise, at a cost of &euro;3.2 Million.  This Business Park is suitable for a range of clients and is being actively marketed by the Agency to potential investors.</p></reply>

This showed strong performance by the agency, particularly in the area of job growth.  Especially notable was the fact that all counties experienced net growth.  Laois in particular saw a net employment increase of 8%, which is higher than the national average of 5%.  168 jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland in Laois throughout the course of 2017, giving a net gain figure of 109 when job losses are considered.  This takes the number of Enterprise Ireland supported jobs in the county to 1,473.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland recognises the importance of strengthening employment throughout the country.  Its Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) has had one call to date, and is focused on supporting major new collaborative and innovative initiatives that have the potential to make a significant impact on enterprise development in the regions, sustain and increase employment at a national, regional and county level.  </p>  <p>  In December I announced the 21 successful companies under the REDF that were granted a combined &euro;30.5 million. One of the projects granted funding is based in Laois. Call two of this fund will be announced in March, and I am confident that we will see a similar level of engagement throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  2017 was a good year for regional job growth in Ireland, with 65% of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland being located outside Dublin.  It is important, however, not to become complacent and it is with this in mind that Enterprise Ireland will continue to implement its wider strategy contained in its Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017-2020 report, which includes aims such as:</p>  <p>  -  Assisting clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs;</p>  <p>  -  Growing the annual exports of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;</p>  <p>  -  Increasing the level of spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and</p>  <p>  -  Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.  </p></reply>

My Department works in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills in developing the policies and interventions to address the skills needs of the economy but primary policy responsibility for this area rests with the Department of Education and Skills.  For its part, my Department has consistently shown its commitment to meeting the requirements of the sector through our regular focus on construction needs in the Action Plan for Jobs.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills have developed a number of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes spanning a wide range of both skills and sectors.  They are developed in response to identified needs in the economy. In relation to the construction industry, two new apprenticeships have been approved for development this year in the areas of quantity surveying and scaffolding.  The addition of these new apprenticeships will add to the suite of construction apprenticeships already in existence in the areas of brick and stonelaying; carpentry and joinery; painting and decorating; plastering; plumbing; stonecutting and stonemasonry; and wood manufacturing and finishing.  </p>  <p>  Springboard also provides courses to allow those both in the labour market and on the live register to upskill in areas where there are employment opportunities in the economy.  All Springboard courses lead to qualifications in enterprise sectors which are growing and need skilled personnel.  As a result of the current and future demand for construction jobs in the economy, Springboard offers courses including a MSc in Quantity Surveying and Postgraduate certificates in BIM technologies.  A call for further proposals for Springboard 2018 is scheduled to be issued by the HEA in January 2018.  </p></reply>

For example, since its launch in January 2015, the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) process - coordinated by my Department - is focused on ensuring that all regions of the country can fulfil their enterprise and job creation potential and contribute optimally to national economic performance.  The Regional APJs are a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 200,000 jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these located outside of Dublin.  Regional employment has grown strongly and four out of five jobs created last year were outside Dublin.  Over the same period, employment grew faster in the regions (2.8%) than in Dublin (1.5%).  </p>  <p>  In this context, my Department played a key role in developing the strategies in the first instance.  A key strength of the RAPJs process is its 'ground - up' approach.  Each Action Plan was developed following extensive consultation, including well attended regional stakeholder fora, where members of the public, private, and voluntary sectors, in addition to relevant Government departments and bodies were able to actively engage.  Involvement of regional partners from both the private and public sector has fostered strong buy-in, a sense of ownership and a strong momentum.  </p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has prepared a draft National Planning Framework (NPF), the long-term, twenty-year strategy for the spatial development of Ireland.  The draft was published for consultation in September last.  </p>  <p>  There is a strong interdependence between the planning and development of an attractive environment and enterprise development.  The concept of 'Place-Making' is a core tenet of Enterprise 2025 - our national enterprise policy statement to 2025.  My Department, at official level, is a member of the Inter-Departmental NPF Steering Committee and the NPF&rsquo;s Econometric and Demographics Working Group.  The NPF has also been the subject of discussions at the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, of which I am a member.  </p>  <p>  My Department will contribute to the proposed new Regional and Spatial Economic Strategies (RSESs) being led by the three Regional Assemblies, based on Enterprise 2025 - and officials will be key members of the proposed Senior Advisory Bodies being put in place.  My Department contributes in relation to the role of enterprise, the need to cater to the differing development potential and requirements across regions to optimise potential for growth, the importance of economic infrastructure to support economic development, and the combinations of infrastructure and factors that shape the potential of each region.  </p></reply>

The same publication also notes that all but two counties experienced a year on year rise in commercial vacancy rates to Q2 2017.  Addressing town centre renewal is an important factor in sustaining the attractiveness of urban centres as places not only to live in, but to work in, do business in and invest in.  My Department is supporting retail and town centre renewal through the Retail Consultation Forum.  The &lsquo;Framework for Town Centre Renewal&rsquo; was developed in 2017 by a Working Group of this Forum, setting out a practical step by step action plan for stakeholders to work collaboratively to enhance their local town or village, and encouraging towns and villages to establish a digital platform in response to the changing retail environment.  It has also served as a support document for towns and villages applying for funding under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the Western Development Commission&rsquo;s publication on the Western Region&rsquo;s Labour Market which findings were based on the 2011 and 2016 censuses.  </p>  <p>  I expect to shortly publish Action Plan for Jobs 2018, following an intensive consultation process.  This is the eighth such Plan at the national level since its commencement in 2012, which has over that time maintained a strong emphasis on stimulating regional growth.  </p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that while jobs are growing right across the country some regions are growing faster than others.  That is why to complement actions at the national level, the Government launched the Regional Action Plan for Jobs in 2015.  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s national ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, 135,000 of which are outside of Dublin.  A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 percent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not exceeding one percentage point above the national average.  </p>  <p>  Each Regional Action Plan includes a series of practical actions to support enterprise growth and job creation in the region, within clear timelines for delivery.  The Plans seek to build on the particular strengths and opportunities of each region and have been developed by my Department in close consultation with regional stakeholders from the public and private sectors.  The Plans champion the concept of regional collaboration to achieve competitive advantage in each of the regions.  </p>  <p>  Of course, the Regional Action Plans on their own will not solve everything; they are complemented by other programmes that the Government is working on at national level, including the Action Plan for Rural Development, the Action Plan for Housing, the National Planning Framework and Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies as well as skills strategies and infrastructural projects.  </p>  <p>  Co. Sligo is part of the North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs.  This Plan is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region, with public and private stakeholders actively engaged.  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism.  The core objective of the Plan is to see a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020 and to reduce the unemployment rate to within 1 percentage point of the State average.  </p>  <p>  There has been a substantial improvement in the North East/North West region since the commencement of the National Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, with an additional 22,200 in employment in Q2 2017 compared to Q1 2012.  There are now 6,000 more people in work in the region since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative in early 2015.  Moreover, latest CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the region has fallen from 10.2% in Q1 2015 to 6.6% in Q2 2017, compared to the then national rate of 6.4%.  </p>  <p>  The latest CSO figures show that there were 3,362 people on the Live Register in County Sligo in December 2017.  This figure represents a decrease of 12.7%, or 492 individuals, over the previous 12 months.  This reduction is to be welcomed and demonstrates that while there are still challenges to surmount in bringing down this figure further, the overall trend for County Sligo is one of steady improvement.  </p>  <p>  Progress Reports on the implementation of the Regional Action Plans across all regions show that good progress has been made in implementing the actions.  Published reports are available on www.regionalapj.ie.  The Plans have also helped to facilitate a strong foundation of collaboration among the enterprise champions, local authorities, enterprise agencies and other key stakeholders involved in the regions.  My Department continues to work closely with the Regional Action Plan Implementation Committees in relation to the direction of the initiative to 2020.  </p>  <p>  This Government is conscious that ambitious regional targets must be properly resourced under the Regional Action Plans.  To this end, additional funds to support regional employment are being made available through the enterprise agencies on a rolling basis out to 2020.  </p>  <p>  In June 2016 an initial allocation of &euro;5m for 48 local and regional initiatives under two of these calls was announced: the LEO Competitive Fund and the Community Enterprise Initiative.  All regions benefitted under this initiative.  </p>  <p>  On 11 December last, I announced the results of the first call under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;60 million Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF).  This Fund is supporting the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs through enabling the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first call.  Over &euro;5m has been approved for the Northern and Western region, subject to grant conditions.  The second call under this Scheme will fund projects from the remaining balance of the &euro;60m budget available and will be announced in Q1 this year.  In order to ensure a balanced regional spread, Enterprise Ireland has targeted a minimum of &euro;2m to be allocated for the best ranked project/s from each region across the entirety of the &euro;60 million fund.  </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;150m is also being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.  The agency has received over &euro;90 million of this to date.  This programme includes include the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country which will help draw more multinational companies to regional areas.  So far, IDA has successfully secured tenants for the first buildings completed under its Regional property investment programme, one of which is in Sligo.  </p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies are working very hard towards the Government&rsquo;s ambitious job creation targets at national and regional level.  </p>  <p>  Under IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy "Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015, the Agency is targeting the creation of 80,000 new jobs and 900 new investments over this period.  The Agency is also aiming to increase the level of investment by between 30% and 40% in each region.  Since the launch of the Strategy, half of all jobs created by IDA client Companies have been based outside of Dublin.  County Sligo currently has 23 IDA client companies supporting almost 2,200 jobs.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland recognises the need for the development of sustainable, quality jobs throughout the country &ndash; especially in areas that have had historically low job creation.  Progress is being made in this regard.  I was pleased to see that when Enterprise Ireland announced its End of Year Statement for 2017 earlier this month, all counties had experienced growth.  Sligo performed particularly well in 2017, with Enterprise Ireland supported client companies registering an employment increase of 11%.  This made Sligo the second best performing county in the country, coming second only to Leitrim at 12%.  Sligo's performance in 2017 is also higher than the North-West regional average of 7%.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is committed to developing employment growth &ndash; a fact reflected in the fact that 65% of jobs created by the agency in 2017 were outside Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with its client companies to further support and develop employment throughout Ireland during 2018.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to draw your attention to the work of the Sligo Local Enterprise Office, which offers a wide range of business supports to entrepreneurs, early stage promoters, start-ups and small businesses in the Sligo area.  In the three years from 2014 to 2016, a total of 487 jobs were created by companies supported by LEO Sligo.  Feasibility, priming and business expansion grants totalling &euro;1.1m were approved for 77 projects during this period, while 80 grants were issued to micro-enterprises in the County under the Trading Online Voucher Scheme.  </p>  <p>  It is the cumulative effect of all of these activities - and the collaboration which they will bring about in their delivery - which will make a real and lasting impact on the jobs potential of Sligo and the wider North-West.  </p></reply>

So while staff may have been subject to cuts, it is not known if the cuts were to the same extent as those applied to public servants.  There are significant cost implications to be considered.  Also, staff in these organisations are not public servants and, as such, are not entitled to the pay restoration provided for in the Public Service Agreements.  Indeed, the issue of public servant status for the employees of such organisations is an issue which goes beyond the health sector with far reaching implications across the public sector as a whole.  </p>  <p>  However, I am continuing to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in an effort to find a way to address this complex situation.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be familiar with the background to the closure of  both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4, 133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  </p>  <p>  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

However, all efforts are made by hospitals to limit cancellations particularly for clinically urgent procedures.  </p>  <p>  Cancellation of elective procedures can occur for a variety of exceptional reasons including cancellations because a bed or the clinical team are not available, cancellations by the patient or because the patient may not be fit for surgery at the time.  </p>  <p>  Based on data provided by the NTPF, collated from reports by hospitals, approximately 3,400 elective procedures, on average, are cancelled per month.  However, this must be seen in context.  The most recent data available shows that for 2016, typically in a month, there were approximately 53,000 admissions to acute hospitals on a daycase and an inpatient basis.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that hospitals continue to improve how they manage, and balance, the demand for emergency care with the planning of elective procedures, to minimise the impact on patients.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  </p><p>Under the legislation having a particular illness or disability in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. If a person's only income is a means tested Social Welfare Allowance, for example, a Disability Allowance, he/she will qualify for a Medical Card.  </p><p>In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an application exceeds his or her income threshold where he or she faces difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness or disability.  </p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility,</i>which was published  in 2014.  It made a recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  </p><p>As stated in previous PQ responses, with regard to the cost of awarding a medical cards to all adults with disabilities, detailed financial analysis would need to be conducted in order to establish as accurately as possible the expected costs to the Exchequer and this information is not readily available to the HSE.</p></reply>

To support this, the Department of Health is currently engaged in the development of a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-care.  This will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation.  It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner and will help to improve access to home-care services on an affordable and sustainable basis.  The introduction of a system of regulation for home-care will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided.</p>  <p>  The development of a new home care scheme is a complex undertaking which will involve significant legislative, operational and financial resources.  A significant amount of detailed work remains to be undertaken before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services.  Work in relation to the cost of the new statutory scheme is ongoing as part of this process.</p>  <p>  However, on the basis of current demand and demographic projections, it is likely that increased investment will be required to support the implementation of the new statutory scheme.  The HSE home-care services budget for 2018 is &euro;408 million, which it is anticipated will support the delivery of 17.094 million hours of home support to 50,500 people. It is expected that there will be a significant increase in demand for home-care over the coming years.  Furthermore home-care service-users have increasingly complex care needs and there are sustained cost-pressures within the sector which are likely to inflate in the coming years.</p></reply>

I requested that the HSE maximise the benefit for patients from the &euro;0.5m funding in respect of both additional sessions at the existing cath lab and the temporary use of a mobile cath lab for a specific period.  The mobile cath lab has been deployed for the short term provision of cardiac diagnostic angiogram services on the grounds of University Hospital Waterford from 2 October 2017 for a period of 20 weeks and is currently providing a scheduled diagnostic angiography service on a 3 day per week basis.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the process for the recruitment of staff in order to support extension of the operating hours of the existing cath lab by 20%, as recommended in the Herity report, has commenced with the increase in hours of the existing cath lab to come into effect once the contract for the mobile cath lab ceases (after 12 February, 2018).   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in July 2017, I agreed to expedite the commencement of the national review of all PPCI services, encompassing the South East region.  One of the guiding principles for this review is to strive to provide a PPCI service that can deliver clinical outcomes on a par with international standards.  The Steering Group for this National Review has now been established and the first meeting will occur on 31 January 2018.  The Chair of the Steering Group is Professor Philip Nolan, President of Maynooth University.  The National Review aims to report to the Minister within 12-18 months of its first meeting.  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services will examine all activity in cardiac catheterisation laboratories nationally.  This will include the activity data from the mobile lab in UHW.</p></reply>

Responsibility for reporting individual consultant compliance was devolved to the Hospital Groups in 2014.  The main reason for this is to ensure local accountability.  Hospitals know their consultants and the work they deliver.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to ensure that more robust measures are in place in 2018 to make sure all consultants comply with their contractual obligations.  My Department is working closely with the HSE to find a solution to ensure compliance is monitored more effectively and remedial action pursued where required.</p>  <p>  On 21 December the Director General advised the Secretary General of the structures currently in place in the context of the HSE's Performance Accountability Framework with monthly performance meetings between the Hospital Groups and their individual hospitals and the expectation that Groups review public/private mix and consultant contract compliance as part of the monthly engagement.  He also  advised that further assurance processes with the Groups were being put in place to confirm contract compliance, including written annual confirmation that: reports are provided to consultants monthly, there is appropriate review by the clinical director, processes are in place locally to determine compliance with contracted hours.</p>  <p>  My Department has also engaged with the HSE in response to some broader issues which the HSE has raised concerning oversight of the contract, including the impact of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 and the need for hospitals to collect private patient income.  However, the HSE has already been advised that those issues do not affect the implementation of measures required to ensure robust governance and monitoring of compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to consultants engaging in private practice, with remedial action pursued where required.  A meeting between my Department and the HSE on the immediate requirements regarding monitoring of compliance at the individual consultant level and the broader issues is to take place shortly.</p>  <p>  I have also established an independent group, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system.  This Group has now commenced its work and is to conclude by the end of next summer.  This was one of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare Report.</p></reply>

Consultation fees charged by GPs outside the terms of the GMS or GP Visit Card contracts are a matter of private contract between clinicians and their patients and I have no role in relation to such fees.</p>  <p>  There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.</p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway.  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p></reply>

This means that they are facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as it is viable with services such as home support, day care, community support and/or intermediate care beds to avoid unnecessary acute hospital admissions.   </p>  <p>  Traditionally, home care was viewed as providing a lower level of support than residential care, and not as an alternative to it. Increasingly, however, it is considered possible to support many people to continue to live at home who would previously have gone into residential care.  Funding for Older Persons&rsquo; Services has increased from &euro;763 million in 2017 to &euro;811 million in 2018.  This includes approximately &euro;408 million for the provision of home support services by the HSE or other providers.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of 17.094 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with 16.34 million hours delivered to 50,000 people in 2017 (home help and home hours combined), an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people year on year.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  The HSE will continue to encourage local integration of services and build appropriate care pathways, in particular for people with dementia and complex needs.</p>  <p>  Improving home-care services so that people can continue to live with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes for as long as possible is a key commitment of the Government.  However, the only statutory scheme in place at present to support older people is the Nursing Home Support Scheme.  The Government intends to address this by establishing a new standalone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care services and the further development of home care services to provide a more viable alternative to nursing home care for a greater number of people.  The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this.  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to how decisions are made on allocating services.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step towards ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.</p>  <p>  The development of a new home care scheme is a complex undertaking which will involve significant legislative, operational and financial resources.  A significant amount of detailed work remains to be undertaken before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services. This is necessary if reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.</p></reply>

The National Maternity Strategy, published in January 2016, reaffirms the commitment to the provision of tri-located maternity services on the campus; a site for the proposed maternity hospital is identified in the St James's campus Master Plan.</p>  <p>  Of course the new children's hospital is currently under construction on that campus.  The Deputy may however wish to note that construction of the new maternity hospital will not commence until after the new children's hospital is completed.  I can confirm that the new children's hospital design has incorporated the required operational links with both the maternity and adult hospitals.</p></reply>

The definition of the term &ldquo;worker&rdquo; used in the legislation  includes current and former employees, independent contractors, trainees and agency staff.  Prior to the enactment of this Act persons employed by the HSE could make protected disclosures to an Authorised Person under the Health Act 2004 (as amended in 2007).  Some sections of this legislation are also still in force.  </p><p>Section 5 of the 2014 Act provides protection for workers who disclose information in relation to the following wrongdoings:</p><p>a. the commission of an offence;</p><p>b. the failure of a person to comply with any legal obligation, other than one arising under the worker's contract of employment or other contract whereby the worker undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services;</p><p>c. a miscarriage of justice;</p><p>d. a danger to the health and safety of any individual;</p><p>e. damage to the environment;</p><p>f. an unlawful or otherwise improper use of funds or resources of a public body, or of other public money;</p><p>g. an act or omission by or on behalf of a public body that is oppressive, discriminatory or grossly negligent or constitutes gross mismanagement; or</p><p>h. information tending to show any matter falling within any of the preceding paragraphs (a) to (g) has been, is being, or is likely to be concealed or destroyed.</p><p>A worker must make a disclosure in the manner set out in the Act to be entitled to the protections of the Act.  Different standards apply depending on the person or body to whom the worker discloses. </p><p>A disclosure may be made to the employer.  The HSE encourages all workers to make disclosures internally to their employer in the first instance.  Such disclosures will be taken seriously and the worker making a protected disclosure, as defined by and in accordance with the Act, will be entitled to the protections set out in the Act.</p><p>Alternatively, a worker may make a disclosure to persons other than their employer in certain circumstances.  Different requirements need to be met in different cases, as set out at (a) to (e) below:</p><p>a. Other responsible person </p><p>Where the worker reasonably believes that the wrongdoing relates solely or mainly to the conduct of a person other than the worker&rsquo;s employer or to something for which that other person has legal responsibility, then the worker may disclose to that other person.</p><p>b. A prescribed person</p><blockquote>Certain persons are prescribed by Statutory Instrument 339 of 2014 (&ldquo;SI 339&rdquo;) to receive disclosures (&ldquo;prescribed persons&rdquo;). `This includes the heads or senior officials of a range of statutory bodies.<br /><br />A worker may make a disclosure to a prescribed person if the worker reasonably believes that the relevant wrongdoing falls within the description of matters in respect of which the person is a prescribed person.  In the case of such a disclosure, the worker must believe that the information disclosed, and any allegation contained in it, are substantially true.</blockquote><p>c. A Government Minister </p><blockquote>If a worker is or was employed in a public body, she/he may make a disclosure to a Minister on whom any function related to the HSE is conferred or imposed by or under any enactment.  Accordingly, workers covered by these Procedures may make a disclosure to the Minister for Health, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and any other Minister on whom any function related to the HSE is conferred or imposed by or under any enactment.</blockquote><p>d. A legal adviser</p><blockquote>A disclosure may be made by a worker in the course of obtaining legal advice from a barrister, solicitor, trade union official or official of an excepted body (an excepted body is a body which negotiates pay and conditions with an employer but is not a trade union as defined in section 6 of the Trade Union Act 1941).</blockquote><p>e. Alternative external disclosures (in very limited circumstances)</p><blockquote>It is preferable in most circumstances to disclose to the employer and, if that is not appropriate, to one of the disclosure options at (a) to (d) above.  It will rarely be appropriate to make alternative external disclosures where the disclosure could be dealt with through one of the other disclosure options above.  There are stringent requirements for alternative external disclosures to qualify as protected disclosures under the Act.</blockquote><p>I am committed to facilitating the disclosure of wrongdoing and encouraging workers to make protected disclosures at the earliest possible opportunity.  I would also encourage workers to make disclosures to their employer in the first instance and to use the internal procedures provided. </p><p>Such disclosures will be taken seriously and the worker making a protected disclosure will receive appropriate protection as set out in the legislation.  There is an onus on the HSE to address any disclosure made, to conduct an investigation where warranted and to address all findings of that investigation that require attention.  The legislation emphasises that workers will be protected from penalisation and from dismissal for having made a protected disclosure.  </p><p>The contact details for the Authorised Person in the HSE are:  </p><p><b>By post:</b>Office of the Authorised Person, PO Box 11571, Dublin 2; </p><p><b>By phone</b>: 01-6626984 or 071-9834651 (10am-1pm and 2-5pm; Monday-Friday);</p><p><b>By email</b>:<i>protected.disclosures@hse.ie.</i></p></reply>

The Programme is responsible for assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise- nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland. </p>  <p>In line with the National Rare Diseases Plan, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, encouraged designated centres of expertise in Ireland to apply for membership of European Reference Networks (ERNs) during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.    Three of these centres are now represented on ERN network.</p>  <p>  Membership of ERNs will bring opportunities for engaging in research relating to Rare Diseases in keeping with the National Rare Diseases Plan.  Further centres are expected to apply for membership or affiliated membership of ERNs when the next call takes place in early 2018.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) was a key recommendation of the Rare Disease plan.  The office provides current and reliable information about rare diseases to the general public, health care professionals, researchers and policy makers.  The National Rare Diseases Office is responsible for updating Orphanet Ireland.   Orphanet is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.  The office also manages the National Rare Diseases Information Line (a Freephone service) and provides online information about rare diseases on their website.</p>  <p>  A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE Acute Hospitals Division has developed the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee.  A Chairperson has now been identified and it is expected that the Group will convene in early 2018.</p>  <p>  One of the recommendations of the National Plan for Rare Diseases was that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.</p>  <p>  Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.  The National Rare Diseases Office developed eLearning modules for healthcare professionals.  These modules are available on HSE website.</p>  <p>The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings.    It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries.  This model of care is in development by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  At the EU level, the Joint Research Centre is developing a joint European Platform on Rare Disease Registration which will promote EU level standards for data collection and contribute to the development of rare disease registries across the EU.</p>  <p>  The Plan also recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders, including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan&rsquo;s recommendations.  This group was established by the Department of Health in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions  .</p>  <p>  The National Rare Disease Plan continues to be implemented.  The Department will consider the matter of a further plan as part of its Work Programme for 2018.</p></reply>

This will represent a move away from a hospital centric approach to one which is focussed on prevention and early intervention and which will provide the majority of care in the community.  This greater integration between primary and acute care will provide person-centred, co-ordinated care, with improved care and outcomes for patients. </p>  <p>  There is already much activity underway across the health service to develop better integration across acute hospitals and community care services.  This has been supported by the HSE's Clinical Care Programmes and a wide range of initiatives that have developed at a local level.  The HSE's Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division is leading a large-scale programme of work to develop a system of integrated care within our health and social care services.  Currently work is underway under four Integrated Care Programmes (ICP for Older Persons, ICP for the Prevention and Management of Chronic Disease, ICP Patient Flow, ICP for Children) and the national, regional and local governance structures are now in place to guide and support the implementation of the required changes.  Several pilot schemes have been established and in 2018 new integrated care models and pathways will be developed.  </p>  <p>  Building on the work underway, the delivery of integrated care, with collaboration between care professionals across primary, social care and hospital settings will have  positive benefits for patients, providing a better care pathway and facilitating  more care outside the hospital.</p></reply>

They provide over 5,000 long stay residential care beds and  about 2,000 short-stay public beds providing step-up, step-down care; intermediate care; and rehabilitation and respite care.  The public centres providing short-stay beds are a mixture of stand-alone centres and centres with separate wings for rehabilitation /respite etc. </p>  <p>  While the care delivered to residents in our community hospitals is generally of a very high standard, many of these services are delivered in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.  It is important therefore that we upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the five year Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units which was announced in 2016.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.  Significant work has been undertaken by the HSE in determining the most appropriate scheduling of projects over the 5 year period from 2016 to 2021, within the phased provision of funding, to achieve compliance and registration with HIQA. </p></reply>

The OPAP covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. </p><p>Every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity.  The OPAP clearly acknowledges this.</p><p>The OPAP prescribed Ten Steps Forward that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity.  These contain a number of actions, some of which have been identified for early implementation.  A summary of progress with implementation of the Ten Steps Forward is outlined in the following table:<table><tr><th>No.</th><th>Action</th><th>Progress</th></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Embed multi-sectoral actions on obesity prevention with the support of government departments and public sector agencies.</td><td>My Department has established an Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group.  The national Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) - under the Chair of my Department - is comprised of representatives from the following Departments and Agencies: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Children and Youth Affairs; Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; University College Cork; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Health Service Executive (HSE) - including the National Clinical Lead for Obesity; and Safefood. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the OPIOG held its inaugural meeting on the 19th of October last with further meetings to be arranged at agreed intervals for the purposes of providing oversight to the implementation of the national Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP).  The OPIOG will identify processes for engaging with networks of stakeholders. It will elaborate on this aspect of its functions over the course of its work to implement the OPAP that runs up to 2025.<br /><br />The Minister for Finance has also announced in Budget 2018 the introduction of a sugar tax, at a rate of 30 cent per litre on drinks with over eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres, along with a reduced rate of 20 cent per litre on drinks with between five and eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres.</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Regulate for a healthier environment</td><td>The development of legislation for calorie posting to support people to make healthy choices is underway by the Department. Currently, a behaviour study on how best to make the posting of calories meaningful to customers and more likely to impact on their behaviours is being carried out by the ESRI. In addition, actions in this area are being progressed through engagement with other Government Departments to support the work of stakeholders involved in planning and developing the built environment.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Secure appropriate support from the commercial sector to play its part in obesity prevention.</td><td>At its inaugural meeting, the OPOIG agreed to establish two sub-groups for Reformulation and Healthy Eating.  Further sub-groups will be established as required.  Both sub-groups have agreed to meet and agree their draft Terms of Reference, which in the interim, remain under active consideration in the Department.<br /><br /> Note that one of the priority actions under Step 3 of the OPAP was to &lsquo;Establish a forum for meaningful engagement with industry on best practice initiatives towards a healthy food environment&rsquo;. It is intended to progress this action under the auspices of the OPIOG in 2018.<br /><br /> The Department is planning to launch a Code of Practice for Non-Broadcast Media Advertising and Marketing of Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages, including Sponsorship and Retail Product Placement in the coming weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Implement a strategic and sustained communications strategy that empowers individuals, communities and service providers to become obesity aware and equipped to change, with a particular focus on families with children in the early years.</td><td>I recently launched a new child obesity campaign under the auspices of Health Ireland. It's called the START campaign and it aims to inspire, empower and support parents to start building and persist with healthy lifestyle habits in the family to prevent childhood obesity.  The first phase of the campaign features advertising on TV, radio, video on demand, outdoor and digital platforms.  This will be supported by the Healthy Ireland 2018 campaign. It seeks to encourage people to make positive choices to improve their physical and mental health, while also providing support and information to help people make those healthier choices.</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>The Department of Health, through Healthy Ireland, will provide leadership, engage and co-ordinate multi-sectoral action and implement best practice in the governance of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan.</td><td>As referred to at step 1 above, the establishment of an Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group is well advanced.  New Healthy Eating Guidelines, Food Pyramid and supporting resources have already been published, disseminated and communicated in 2017, including dissemination of the new Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools. <br /><br /> Work has also commenced on developing Healthy Eating Guidelines for the 1-5 year old age group.  As a first step in this work, the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) are currently developing scientific recommendations for food based dietary guidelines for 1 to 5 year olds.  Health and Wellbeing, DOH will then lead out on the development of food based Healthy Eating Guidelines for this age group.<br /><br /> New Nutrition Standards for schools, with an initial focus on school meal programmes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, have also been developed.  These Nutrition Standards were published in September 2017. <br /><br /> The Standards were developed by the Department of Health with the assistance of safefood and the Health Service Executive, in cooperation with the members of the School Meals Programme in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Mobilise the health services to better prevent and address overweight and obesity through effective community-based health promotion programmes, training and skills development and through enhanced systems for detection and referrals of overweight and obese patients at primary care level.</td><td>A Healthy Eating, Active Living Programme has been established as a Policy Priority Programme within the HSE and a three-year plan for the programme has been finalised.  The GP contract for the provision of free care to children under 6 years, already provides that the medical practitioner shall take an active approach toward promoting health and preventing disease through the provision of periodic assessments to child patients. <br /><br /> The HSE is also implementing a Breastfeeding Action Plan and a new Making Every Contact Count brief intervention framework was launched earlier this year by the HSE which aims to capitalise on the opportunities that occur every day within the health service to support people to make healthy lifestyle choices.</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Develop a service model for specialist care for children and adults.</td><td>The HSE National Clinical Lead for Obesity was recently appointed.  This appointment will be important in further advancing the implementation of many of the recommendations in the OPAP including the development of a national integrated service model for the health and social care of overweight and obese people and for developing quality assurance guidance for obesity services.</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Acknowledge the key role of physical activity in the prevention of overweight and obesity.</td><td>'Get Ireland Active!  The National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland' (NPAP) is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, and implementation of that Plan is well underway in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of other stakeholders.  This will be supported by the Healthy Ireland 2018 campaign. It seeks to encourage people to make positive choices to improve their physical and mental health, while also providing support and information to help people make those healthier choices.</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Allocate resources according to need, in particular to those population groups most in need of support in the prevention and management of obesity, with particular emphasis on families and children during the first 1,000 days of life.</td><td>The implementation of the Healthy Eating and Active Living Plan within the HSE will begin to address this action area, with a particular focus on supporting parents and families.</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Develop a multi-annual research programme that is closely allied to policy actions, invest in surveillance and evaluate progress on an annual basis.</td><td>The establishment of the national oversight structure referred to earlier will foster developments under this step of the OPAP.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p><p>An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include:</p><p>- Examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme;</p><p>- The implementation of administrative reforms to the Scheme (Chapter Four of NHSS Review);</p><p>- A review by the NTPF of present pricing arrangements in private residential facilities.</p><p>Work is on-going across the range of recommendations and many of these have been completed and operationalised.  A number of the recommendations in the Review relate to the identification of specific areas of the Scheme that require further and considerable detailed analysis and review.  One of these recommendations included a detailed review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and work in this area is ongoing and well advanced. </p><p>The Review also recommended that a Value For Money (VFM) and Policy Review of the differences in the comparative cost of public and private long-term residential care be undertaken.  Work on the scoping of this review began in late 2017.  Detailed  work on the VFM review wil commence in 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2019.</p><p>The following table provides the current status in relation to the consideration of the

This review is well advanced and a report is expected to be submitted to the Minister for consideration in the first half of 2018</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The cost of public long-term residential care should be based on a pricing model that is objectively and consistently formulated, and which takes account of and accurately quantifies unavoidable price distortions. </td><td>The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. </td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>It is important that the position of section 39 voluntary agencies be addressed.

This is currently being examined by a Department of Health/HSE Group.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Consideration should be given to including in the price contracts with facilities, details of what additional charges are proposed, of the opt-out arrangements that exist for residents and confirmation that residents will not be charges for extra services that they cannot participate in because of their dependency or lack of capacity. </td><td>As above</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>It may continue to be necessary for the HSE to make additional payments in circumstances where very specialist care is required. Engagement with acute, disability and other services is required to give a more comprehensive service for this co-hort. </td><td>This HSE approach is continuing to operate.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>The HSE should publish the cost of care on an annual basis.</td><td>The weekly cost of care for private and voluntary nursing homes is published following agreement being reached with the NTPF</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>The HSE should continue to review the costs in its facilities to examine if facilities can be made more cost efficient. The review should start with the most expensive nursing homes and then cascade down. </td><td>HSE continue to review the cost of care in their Nursing Home Facilities</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>A value for money and policy review will be undertaken of HSE public long-term residential care facilities to examine the extent to which cost differentials with care in private facilities can be attributed to patient dependency characteristics or other objective factors for which a higher level of cost is justified. </td><td>A VFM review will be undertaken by the Department of Health.

This is as a result of the concerted efforts of staff and clinicians across the treating hospitals, HSE and Children's Hospital Group to increase activity within our children's hospitals, the Mater and Cappagh hospitals as well as of outsourcing initiatives developed by the HSE.  371 surgeries took place in 2017 across all treating hospitals both home and abroad, including two hospitals which were successful in an international tender run by the HSE for paediatric spinal fusion procedures. </p>  <p>  A Paediatric Scoliosis Services Co-Design group is in place, which includes clinicians, hospital staff and representatives from the scoliosis advocacy groups, to design a comprehensive contemporary and  patient-centred approach to the delivery of scoliosis services.</p>  <p>  &euro;9 million investment funding has been allocated for 2018 to the HSE for the development of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis.  The 2018 Service Plan includes a commitment from the HSE to continue to improve access to paediatric orthopaedics, including surgery for scoliosis, in conjunction with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group to achieve clinically appropriate waiting times.  This will be underpinned by the development of a standardised pathway of care for children and adolescents with scoliosis which will be evidence-based and patient-centred.  Further development of Scoliosis services will be guided by the recommendations emerging from the work of the Co-Design Group.  The Co-Design Group is also working towards publishing agreed criteria for surgery which are based on clinical grounds and national and international best practice.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the 4-month target for accessing surgery for scoliosis will be maintained into 2018 and beyond. </p></reply>

October's Budget announced a total 2018 allocation of &euro;55m for the National Treatment Purchase Fund for 2018.  This significant increase in funding more than doubles their 2017 total allocation of &euro;20m.</p>  <p>  Cataracts are among the most common procedures carried out in the Ophthalmology specialty and were a key focus of the NTPF initiatives in 2017 with significant progress achieved.  Between July and December the overall cataract waiting list was reduced by 2,000 and the number waiting over 15 months was reduced from almost 1,600 to just over 300.  NTPF figures for the end of December showed more than half of cataract patients are waiting less than 6 months and 72% are waiting less than 9 months.  In 2018 the NTPF will continue to arrange the provision of treatment for Inpatient/Daycase patients across a range of specialties and procedures including the provision of cataract operations and I expect to see further progress due to the increased Government funding being made available. </p>  <p>  The NTPF work with public and private hospitals in order to provide access for patients to treatment and the hospitals and initiatives are evaluated in line with standard procurement practice.  This criteria consists of a combination of price per treatment and the experience of the hospital in providing similar treatments to its patients. </p>  <p>  The HSE and NTPF are working together to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2018.  These plans will see a continued focus on long-waiting patients and overall waiting lists.</p></reply>

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -<i> -</i>and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.</p><p>The HSE have confirmed that a person may avail of cataract surgery under the Cross Border Directive.</p><p>Reducing waiting times for patients is one of this Government's key priorities.  October's Budget announced a total 2018 allocation of &euro;55m for the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) for 2018.  This more than doubled its 2017 total allocation which was &euro;20m.  This year, there will be continued focus on long-waiting patients and overall waiting list numbers.  This funding will enable the provision of treatment patients on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List across a range of specialties and procedures.  The NTPF will work with both public and private hospitals in order to provide access for patients to treatment.  Further, additional funding of &euro;10m in 2018 will be dedicated to addressing other waiting lists, including children in need of paediatric orthopaedic and scoliosis procedures.

Primary legislation will be required to give effect to this measure and my Department has begun work in this regard. Subject to the agreement of Government to the specific legislative proposals drawn up, it is my objective to have this legislation prepared and brought to the Oireachtas as soon as it is possible.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the important role that GPs play in our health service and I remain strongly committed to the development of a new, modernised GP services contract.  Engagement with GP representatives  in this regard is underway and I am hopeful that agreement can be reached in the coming months on service developments that can be introduced during 2018.  It is open to GP representative bodies to raise any which their members may have with my Department and the HSE as part of the ongoing contractual engagement process.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, as well as the introduction of enhanced supports for rural GP practices. Separately, the number of GPs being trained is being increased.  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually. In 2009, there were 120 places available and in 2017 there were 170 places filled an increase of over 40%.  The HSE's 2018  National Service Plan envisages a further increase, to 187 places this year.</p></reply>

In 2014, PHECC developed the First Aid Response (FAR) education and training standard, building on its foundational Cardiac First Response course.  </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is responsible for the enforcement of Occupational First Aid (OFA) provisions of Part 7 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007.  I understand that since September last, FAR is now recognised by the HSA as the recognised standard to meet occupational first aid needs in the workplace.  Both the HSA and PHECC have issued joint communications to inform OFA providers and instructors, recognised institutions, students and employers of the key activities and milestones over the course of the transition from OFA to FAR, the most recent of which was provided on 13 December 2017. </p>  <p>  Training institutions/individuals who wish to conduct courses and award PHECC qualifications must comply with and meet the Council approved PHECC Education and Training standard commensurate with the particular course they wish to conduct and certificate they seek to award. Therefore, training organisations, including sole traders, who wish to deliver FAR and FAR instructor training are encouraged to become Recognised Institutions (RI) with PHECC.  This involves an application process and a commitment to adhere to Council rules for Recognised Institutions and the Quality Review Framework.  There is no prohibition on any training provider being recognised by PHECC to deliver training, provided that they meet the standard set by Council.  In the interest of protecting patients and the public, only approved organisations and individuals are permitted to advertise PHECC approved courses or use the PHECC logo on promotional material. </p>  <p>  I have been assured that PHECC has and will continue to meet organisations and/or individuals to address any issues or concerns that have arisen in relation to the transition from the OFA to the FAR standard.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a recommendation to examine the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms.  I am committed to this review, however, it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  The Department has recently received this advice and are exploring the legislative changes necessary and any potential impacts as a result  of amending the scheme.  It is not possible to comment on the specific queries the Deputy has raised at this time in advance of any proposed changes to the scheme being presented and progressed through the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association  to discuss the matter and will continue to do so in the future.</p></reply>

Since 2009 all nursing homes whether public or private are registered and inspected by HIQA.  This includes a number of nursing homes operated by religious organisations.  Under Section 2 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, premises in which the majority of the persons being maintained are members of a religious order or priests of any religion are offered an exemption to registration.  The exclusion of Religious orders was debated at the time of passage of the Bill in 1989 and 1990.  It was recognised that a religious community caring for its members was akin to the family of the members of the religious order and therefore should be excluded in the same manner as the legislation excludes care by a family member of another family member such as a child caring for a parent or a spouse.</p></reply>

An extensive review is now underway, involving an audit of 46,202 images relating to 26,751 patients.  The audit commenced on 23 October 2017 and is expected to be completed shortly.  A South/South West Hospital Group Safety Incident Management Team (SIMT) commissioned by the CEO of the S/SWHG and chaired by the Chief Operations Officer is in place and meets weekly.  University Hospital Kerry is currently operating a helpline for patients who may have queries which is open 9am-5pm on working days.</p>  <p>  The current priority is to ensure this look back review is completed as swiftly as possible, following which there will be a more detailed focus on identifying any and all issues arising in relation to processes and procedures. </p></reply>

The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement reached last year at the Workplace Relations Commission between this Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, INMO and SIPTU Nursing provided for a number of specific measures to attract and retain nursing staff.</p>  <p>  The Agreement committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017.  According to the most recent figures nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of November 2017 stood at 36,616 whole time equivalents.  The number of nursing posts has increased by 820 in the 12 months from end November 2016 and by over 2,500 in the four years from end November 2013 to end November 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition to increasing the number of nursing staff, management agreed to other key measures such as extensive education and personal development opportunities for nurses and midwives to upskill including 120 Advanced Nurse Practitioner training places which are now filled.  The Agreement also includes 127 promotional posts for staff nurses/midwives to Clinical Nurse/Midwife Manager 1 and a pilot pre-retirement initiative has been offered as a method of retaining the expertise of experienced nursing/midwifery staff.  Following discussions at the public sector pay talks in the summer last year a number of nursing allowances were restored.</p>  <p>  I am awaiting a report with the December 2017 figures which is due at the end of this month.  However, based on information to date it appears unlikely that the target of 1,224 posts will be achieved but I can assure the Deputy that the recruitment of nurses and midwives remains a key priority for 2018.</p></reply>

One of the guiding principles for this review is to strive to provide a PPCI service that can deliver clinical outcomes on a par with international standards.  The Steering Group for the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services has now been established and its first meeting is due to take place on 31 January.  The Chair of the Steering Group is Professor Philip Nolan, President of Maynooth University.  The National Review aims to report to the Minister within 12-18 months of its first meeting.</p><p>  Specialist cardiac services cover scheduled and unscheduled hospital-based services for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease.  For the purposes of this National Review, services will include diagnostic (invasive and non-invasive) services, interventional services (to manage coronary artery disease, rhythm disturbances, structural abnormalities and adult congenital heart disease with such interventions usually being performed in cardiac catheterisation laboratories), intensive cardiac care unit, heart failure service, arrhythmia management service, in-patient care for chronic cardiovascular disorders, out-patient services, rehabilitation, teaching, management functions, and sub-specialist clinics and electrophysiological services where appropriate.  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services will examine all activity in cardiac catheterisation laboratories nationally.  This will include the activity data from the mobile lab in UHW.</p></reply>

The emerging findings from the process have also been the subject of broader discussions with that Department in relation to health reform and future capital investment in the context of the mid-term review of the current capital plan and the forthcoming ten year National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  By October 2017, significant progress had been made on data collection, data analysis, and the development of baseline projections. A public stakeholder consultation process and detailed engagement with health system experts had been carried out and the International Peer Review Group had substantively validated the Review's approach and methodology. Sufficient progress had also been made on modelling the impact of potential policy and productivity changes over the projection period.</p>  <p>  Work on the Health Service Capacity Review is at an advanced stage. As previously indicated, the review has a wider scope than previous exercises in that it is examining key elements of primary and community care capacity in addition to acute hospital capacity. This Review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity needed. The findings will also inform the development of a new 10 year national development plan. </p>  <p>  I expect to receive the final report very shortly and I intend to bring the report to Government and have it published as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.  </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs may apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government and Sl&aacute;intecare commit to shifting the model of healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. </p>  <p>  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. A new contract should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce. It should also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency. This will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and officials from the Department of Health and the HSE meet with GP representatives on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that agreement can be reached with GP representatives in the coming months on service developments that can be introduced during 2018. </p>  <p>  Separately, the HSE's National Primary Care Division has undertaken a national review of current GP out of hours services and a final report is expected to be completed shortly.  This report will make recommendations regarding the future provision of GP out of hours services.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the GP contract review process and the out of hours review will result in service improvements across general practice, including out of hours services, benefitting both patients and GPs.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community. In May 2016, 2725 people lived in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings. A congregated setting is defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. </p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions. I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>At the end of December 2017, less than 2,500 people with a disability were living in congregated settings. The HSE's 2018 National Service Plan has set a target of 170 people to move from institutions to community living this year. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;, </i>I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy with specific regard to the information sought by the Deputy in relation to Kerry.</p></reply>

The primary focus of giving the flu vaccine is to increase vaccination rates among healthcare workers and among at risk groups (i.e. long stay residents, 65+ years, pregnant women) so as to reduce and control the incidence of flu and outbreaks in the community and healthcare settings.  I encourage all those in at risk groups to get the vaccine now (if they have not already done so) as it can take up to 2 weeks to work.  The vaccine will help to reduce the risk of flu, reduce hospitalisation and reduce mortality rates.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  Anyone who is assessed as requiring long-term residential care can avail of the Scheme, regardless of age, as long as the person&rsquo;s care needs can be appropriately met in a nursing home that participates in the Scheme. The applicant can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p>  <p>   The Department of Health agree a set level of funding for the NHSS with the HSE each year having regard for the demand for the Scheme and the overall fiscal position. In 2017 the funding was set at &euro;940m and provided long term residential care for over 23,000 people. In order to manage the demand for the Scheme over a 12 month period, the HSE has a target of maintaining the wait time for funding approval at no more than 4 weeks. This target has consistently been achieved since April 2015 and it is a significant reduction from the October 2014 wait time of 15 weeks. The target of 4 weeks for approval of funding remains a commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government. The budget for NHSS in 2018 has been set at &euro;962m.</p></reply>

The work of the Reformulation sub-group - including work that feeds into a methodology for measuring the efficacy of the Sugar Sweetened Drinks (SSD) Tax - is therefore at an early stage. The roadmap for its reformulation work is likely to involve a framework for monitoring and evaluating reformulation targets and engagement with the food industry in this regard. I expect that the elaboration of methodologies will evolve over the course of this work while keeping in mind the proposed date for the introduction of the SSD Tax. The OPIOG also agreed to establish a sub-group for Healthy Eating. Its work is at an early stage and it is expected to meet shortly and agree its draft Terms of Reference.</p>  <p>  My Department liaises with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) on a regular basis. The FSAI has been validating food industry salt reduction work for many years. It has carried out this work by sampling foods from the market and having them analysed in the HSE Public Analysts Laboratory in Galway. This data is published annually and is available on the FSAI website. The FSAI is exploring the validation of FDI sugar and fat reduction work. In the first instance, it has been developing baseline data on specific foods based on food labelled data and a report on this work is expected in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the FSAI has also advised my Department that this year, it is funding the analysis of breakfast cereal and yoghurts for sugar, fat and salt by an external laboratory as part of its reformulation validation work.</p>  <p>  Finally, the draft minutes of the first OPIOG meeting held at the end of October last will be submitted for approval at the next meeting of the OPIOG after which they will be available. Its next meeting is expected to take place in February.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.3097.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600110#WRAAA02200"><p>At the outset, I would like to clarify that my Department has no role in the designation of lands.  That function is exercised through the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The question of compensation does not arise, therefore, in the context of any schemes or measures introduced by my Department.</p>  <p>  As regards the new Hen Harrier Programme, to which I presume the Deputy is referring, I should stress that this is a locally-led pilot project under the European Innovation Partnerships measure, which is not directly administered by my Department.  The design and management of the programme are primarily matters for the local project team, who have consulted widely with farmers in designated areas in the development of the measures to be undertaken on the ground and associated payments.</p>  <p>  I have provided a budget of &euro;25 million for this new innovative agri-environment approach.  This is in addition to the significant framework of support for farmers with hen-harrier designated land already in place through my Department's agri-environment scheme GLAS.  Under GLAS, farmers with hen harrier habitat qualify for a payment of &euro;370 per hectare and can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments.  The GLAS Hen Harrier action has proved hugely successful, with some 2,678 farmers now signed up. This accounts for almost 70% of all farmers with hen harrier habitat.  </p>  <p>  Response to the new locally-led programme has been similarly positive with nearly seven hundred applications received already. This programme targets in particular farmers managing large tracts of hen harrier habitat, and these can earn up to &euro;5,000 a year or more depending on the actions undertaken and results achieved.  For those already in GLAS, this can be in addition to payments currently drawn down under that scheme.</p>  <p>  I regard both these interventions, fostered by my Department, as highly significant developments which will further the conservation of the bird as well as providing an important additional income stream for farmers in designated areas. </p></reply>

One of my key priorities is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drinks internationally, particularly in South East Asia, a  region with favourable demographics and rising incomes. This principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise 2025, but is particularly important now in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In February 2017, I met with Ambassadors and diplomats from the ten South East Asia member countries of the ASEAN Economic Community. I highlighted the fact that the value and volume of trade in agri products to ASEAN countries is already significant, and that there is considerable potential for further growth in the future. I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to furthering these important trading relationships. The ambassadors were interested to hear of Ireland&rsquo;s plans under Food Wise 2025 to grow its agri-food exports to &euro;19 billion by 2025. </p>  <p>  In November 2017 I led a week-long Government of Ireland agri food trade mission to Japan and South Korea, accompanied by Department officials, Bord Bia and representatives of industry. Over five days I met with four Senior Ministers in two major economies, was in the boardrooms of five multi-billion euro companies, and attended thirteen separate promotional events attended by over 400 Japanese and Korean buyers. </p>  <p>  Currently Ireland has access to export beef &amp;amp; pigmeat to Japan and work is underway in relation to removing the certificate condition which allows only beef from cattle under 30 months of age to be exported to Japan. Market access for sheepmeat is also being sought. In the case of South Korea, Ireland has already access for pigmeat and continues the process of pursuing market access for beef, where we are one of the most advanced Member States. </p>  <p>  While questions relating to Bord Bia staffing and representation abroad are a matter for Bord Bia, I am pleased that in 2016 Bord Bia recruited a market manager for South East Asia. While co-located with the Irish Embassy in Singapore, he has a broad remit for a number of South East Asian countries and had a key role in relation to the aforementioned Trade Mission. My Department continues to work closely with Bord Bia in relation to developing new export markets. </p></reply>

In this regard, there are a number of sources of grant aid and other supports provided by Government to indigenous craft beer brewers and distilleries.  </p>  <p>  Marketing and promotional support for indigenous for brewers and distillers are available from Bord Bia including the Thinking House initiative which offers Research &amp;amp; Development facilities to new business startups in the food and drinks industry. </p>  <p>  Grant assistance is available from Enterprise Ireland (EI) for the development of new breweries and distilleries through the Job Expansion Fund  and the Capital Investment Funding schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has provided support for craft and microbreweries through the tax system.

The Scheme is funded through the Rural Development Programme (RDP)  2014 - 2020 and  it complements the range of other RDP supports available to sheep farmers under schemes such as GLAS, TAMS, Knowledge Transfer and the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme.  </p>  <p>  Advance payments in the amount of &euro;16 million under the first year of the Sheep Welfare Scheme have already issued.  Balancing payments issue in respect of these applications will issue in 2018, which will bring the total for Year 1 of the Scheme to approximately &euro;19m.</p>  <p>  The details of the Sheep Welfare Scheme, including the amount of payment to participants, were approved by the European Commission in 2016.  The payment rates are based on the agreed costings underlying the actions to be undertaken in the scheme, and an increase in the funding allocated to existing actions would thus require changes to the actions currently being undertaken by farmers, or the addition of new actions.  Any such changes to the details of the scheme would require the agreement of the European Commission via the formal Rural Development Programme amendment process. </p>  <p>  Year 2 of the Scheme has now been opened and new entrants to the sheep sector can apply for the Scheme at this stage should they wish to do so. </p></reply>

The review took place against the backdrop of an expanding national dairy herd and a slight disimprovement in water quality over the previous monitoring period.</p>  <p>  From the outset the ambition was to ensure a balanced Nitrates Action Programme supporting efficient farming and also protecting and improving water quality. The successful negotiation of the continuation of Ireland's derogation was also a key priority for this Department.</p>  <p>  In December 2017 Ireland secured a positive vote on the renewal of our nitrates derogation for the period 2018-2021 on the basis of a strengthened set of water protection measures. This contrasts with other EU Member States which have had severe difficulties in negotiating a successful renewal of their derogations.</p>  <p>  The derogation allows herdowners farm at a more intensive stocking rate than normally allowed, subject to complying with specific conditions. The derogation is highly important in order to facilitate continued expansion of the dairy sector and for achievement of the targets set out in FoodWise 2025.  There are  additional conditions for derogation farmers to comply with which will improve on farm efficiency and contribute to the continued international recognition of the environmental sustainability of Irish agriculture which is vital in the context of significant agricultural exports in a competitive world market. </p>  <p>  In order to be eligible to apply for a derogation farmers must have sufficient livestock manure storage. Storage requirements have been mandatory since the introduction of the Nitrates regulations a decade ago.</p>  <p>Half of all slurry produced on a derogation farm must be applied by 15 June annually.  After this date slurry may only be applied using low emission equipment. Farmers are increasingly utilising their manures to greatest effect applying a greater percentage in the spring time. The condition further supports that move but also takes account of the fact that agriculture is responsible for 98% of ammonia emissions and that the nitrogen loss from slurry to the atmosphere through ammonia volatilisation in the summer is almost twice that of slurry applied in the spring time. Slurry application by Low Emission Slurry Spreading (LESS) equipment reduces losses by 30% compared to application by splash-plate and reducing ammonia losses results in increased nitrogen uptake by grass. These measures will play an important role in improving efficiency, and reducing nutrient losses to air and water on the more intensively stocked derogation farms, against a backdrop of increase  numbers of such farms.</p>  <p>  Farmers can also apply for grant assistance for the purchase of LESS equipment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) and secure funding of 40% of the cost- rising to 60% for young trained farmers. Applications to date for this scheme have been very strong and have exceeded expectation indicating that farmers are embracing this technology.  </p>  <p>  It is critically important that we achieve the objective of improved water quality in a balanced and proportionate manner securing the long term development ambitions for the industry and avoiding the challenges that are now being faced in some other Member States. The current programme and derogation conditions aims to achieve these twin objectives. </p></reply>

This resulted in the earlier housing of stock and challenges for some farmers in terms of fodder conservation. On foot of these challenges, I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to my request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme and agri-environment schemes.  These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15 October, and balancing payments issued in early December. </p>  <p>  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, injected over &euro;1.3 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and  are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance fodder purchase where necessary.</p>  <p>  Last autumn as poor weather conditions continued, I then asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties, supporting good budgeting for fodder supplies on farms over the winter ahead.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc.  The group held its first meeting in December and met again on Monday, 15 January. The group's objective is to actively monitor the situation and to ensure co-ordinated expertise and guidance is available to affected farmers regarding their options. These may include sourcing alternative feed, reducing non-breeding stock numbers and ensuring they continue to carry out fodder budgeting. </p>  <p>  As outlined at the weekend, my Department is engaging with stakeholders, including through Fodder task force, with a view to providing a targeted contribution towards long-distance transport of fodder to those areas most impacted by the adverse weather. As the deputy can appreciate, fodder sale and purchase is a normal and significant trade between farms on an annual basis and it is important that any prudent measure brought forward is appropriately targeted to those most impacted whilst not impacting negatively on this trade.  </p>  <p>  I would also stress that if a situation arises where the welfare of livestock is at risk, herdowners should contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Animal Welfare helpline or Regional Veterinary Office for support.</p></reply>

A range of direct payments and  grant schemes provide vital income and investment support to the suckler sector, including BPS, ANC, GLAS and TAMS. </p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which will provide Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme period. In response to significant demand, last year I reopened the BDGP programme for new entrants, reflecting the success of this programme, which targets both the environmental footprint and the profitability of the suckler herd through improving the genetic merit in participating herds. </p>  <p>  There are a number of challenges facing the suckler sector in the short and medium term, particularly exchange rate volatility and Brexit. One of my priorities now is to further increase market access and market opportunities for Irish food and drink internationally. We are an exporting nation, with 90% of our food produce leaving the island. By further increasing our footprint internationally we can make a contribution to mitigating the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential.  </p>  <p>  Live exports also play a vital role in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers, including weanlings from the suckler herd at this time of year. It is an area that I have paid particular attention to since taking up office. It is notable that live exports for 2017 were up by 47,000 head, or 33% compared to 2016. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, provisional figures from the Central Statistics Office covering the year to October show a positive trend for Irish beef exports when compared to the same period in 2016. </p></reply>

The majority of applicants who correctly submitted their LESS form on time have now been paid their 2017 GLAS advance. The Department has made great efforts to bring this issue to the attention of farmers and advisors. Multiple reminders have issued. Participants with outstanding LESS forms are urged to submit them immediately.</p>  <p>  Rare Breeds Forms are outstanding or requiring amendment in almost half of the cases qualifying for this action. Nutrient Management Plans remain outstanding in respect of some GLAS I and II participants and applicants should contact their advisors directly to have these submitted urgently. The Commonage Management Plan (CMP) requirements have not been met by some participant&rsquo;s Commonage Advisor. Non-Submission of a 2017 BPS application &ndash; participants who fall into this category are being advised on the steps required to rectify the situation. </p>  <p>  The remaining cases continue to be processed by the Department. As part of the processing of GLAS payments the Department is required to verify all of the data on which the claim is made. Where cases, correctly and accurately, do not pass the validation process they must be further examined and the issue arising resolved. Once these cases pass all validations they are included in future payment runs. Where action is needed by the participant concerned the Department is in direct contact with them. </p></reply>

I welcome the commitment that Direct Payments should remain an essential part of CAP, as they provide an important safety net for family farms and ensure there is agricultural activity in all parts of the EU. </p>  <p>  The Communication outlines a number of possibilities that should be explored to improve the targeting of direct payments. These include compulsory capping of payments, degressive payments and redistributive payments to small or medium size farms. It also suggests that support should be targeted at genuine farmers, focussing on those who are actively farming in order to earn their living.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing the Communication but of course detailed proposals will only emerge in the context of legislative provisions to be presented by the Commission in mid 2018.</p></reply>

This resulted in the earlier housing of stock and challenges for some farmers in terms of Fodder conservation. On foot of these challenges, I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow. The European Commission agreed to my request,  informed in part by the poor  weather conditions  of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme and Agri-environment schemes. These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15th October, and balancing payments issued in early December. </p>  <p>  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, injected over &euro;1.3 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and  are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance fodder purchase where necessary.</p>  <p>  Last autumn as poor weather conditions continued, I then asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties, supporting good budgeting for fodder supplies on farms over the winter ahead.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc.  The group held its first meeting in December and again on Monday 15th  of this week. The group's objective is to actively monitor the situation and to ensure co-ordinated expertise and guidance is available to affected farmers regarding their options. These may include sourcing alternative feed, reducing non-breeding stock numbers and ensuring they continue to carry out fodder budgeting. </p>  <p>  As outlined at the weekend, my Department is engaging with stakeholders, including through Fodder task force, with a view to providing a targeted contribution towards long-distance transport of fodder to those areas most impacted by the adverse weather. As the deputy can appreciate, fodder sale and purchase is a normal and significant trade between farms on an annual basis and it is important that any prudent measure brought forward is appropriately targeted to those most impacted whilst not impacting negatively on this trade.  </p>  <p>  I would also stress that if a situation arises where the welfare of livestock is at risk, herdowners should contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Animal Welfare helpline or Regional Veterinary Office for support. </p></reply>

The Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate arising from Brexit and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors during 2016. It made &euro;150 million of flexible working capital funding available at low-cost interest rate of 2.95%. I launched the Scheme on 31 January 2017 and by the beginning of March, all of the participating banks had reported that their funds were committed.    </p>  <p>  I was pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low-cost flexible finance. I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future. At a Departmental level, there is a close liaison with the banks on lending into the agriculture sector. I meet regularly with the CEOs of the main banks. Access to finance is discussed at both the Dairy and Beef Forums, with an exchange of views with the main banks now a part of the agenda at each meeting. Access to finance for the sector is also an issue identified by the Food Wise 2025 strategy and it is monitored at the High Level Implementation Committee.   </p>  <p>  The Government has committed to assisting all viable small and medium enterprises operating in Ireland to support growth and employment in the economy. Primary responsibility for banking policy lies with the Department of Finance, which liaises with the Central Bank and the Financial Services Ombudsman with regard to consumer protection in the area of personal banking, the purchase of financial products and financial issues generally. It should be noted that in the context of recent high profile loan sales, the Minister for Finance has stated that the sale of loans from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract. Where difficulties occur, active engagement by indebted borrowers with their lender is the key to achieving sustainable resolutions. The next step is engagement with MABS (the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which the Government has recently strengthened) for an independent assessment of their situation and advice on available resolution options.     </p>  <p>  My Department, in cooperation with all the other relevant State bodies, will continue to explore additional funding mechanisms for farmers, the agri-food sector and for SMEs generally. I will launch a new Brexit Loan Scheme with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation shortly, which will provide affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future. The Scheme will make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses. Given their unique exposure to the UK market, funding from my Department ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses (providing &euro;9 million out of the total &euro;23 million in public funding). The successful Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme has provided a template for such Schemes, including this one for businesses. I have also announced that I have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes during 2018 for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses. I will announce more details as they become available.</p></reply>

The number of berths maintained by shipping companies is a commercial matter for the companies themselves. Officials of my Department have been working closely with the shipping companies in recent months to ensure that the greatest facilitation possible is afforded to livestock exporters in the important Spring period.  One of the roll-on roll-off ferry companies is currently actively engaged in the process of securing an alternative vessel to replace its existing vessel which is scheduled for maintenance. I look forward to further update in coming days. </p></reply>

Whilst the overall dairy sector is now in a much better place, particularly at the farm gate, there has been significant recourse to intervention for skimmed milk powder (SMP) across the EU since September 2015. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that between mid 2014 and the end of 2016 dairy markets experienced significant difficulties. This was due to a combination of factors including increased global supply, the effects of the Russian ban on the import of EU agri-food products and reduced global demand, notably for dairy products in China.</p>  <p>  During that phase of volatility, the EU Commission, both prompted and supported by Ireland, among other Member States, responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures, including intervention provided for under the CAP. Ireland welcomed the measures adopted by the Commission during this period. Key among these measures was the buying of skimmed milk powder (SMP) into intervention. Ireland's industry placed some 37,000 tonnes of product into intervention between September 2015 and the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  There are now approximately 376,000 tonnes of SMP in public intervention stocks, effectively overhanging the EU SMP market. My Department engaged with the Commission on recent proposals to limit further piling up of SMP in 2018 without due justification, including requesting that the Commission's proposal to reduce the fixed price ceiling to zero be specified as for 2018 only, to avoid setting a precedent for the longer term. I have previously stated that it is important that the Commission remain vigilant in monitoring the market situation, and has contingencies in place in the event of market volatility re-emerging. </p>  <p>  In common with the vast majority of EU Member States where dairy production is of significance within the broader agri-food sector, Ireland recognises that the current situation in respect of existing stocks cannot be allowed to persist indefinitely. However, the issue of current stocks cannot be disentangled from the issue of managing SMP intervention in 2018 and beyond.  The issues involved, with respect to both market management and sentiment in the sector, are complex and require ongoing careful management.</p>  <p>  It is critically important that the release of these stocks is managed in a way that does not de-stabilise the market.  I am satisfied to date that the Commission has managed these stocks in a prudent manner. </p>  <p>  My Department has and will continue to engage with the Commission, with other Member States, and with national stakeholders on these important issues.</p></reply>

Illegal dumping is one of the unauthorised activities encompassed by those Bye-Laws.</p>  <p>  The matter was also raised with Coillte who advise that, due to the vast and isolated nature of the Coillte estate, illegal dumping is a significant issue for the company. Illegal dumping poses a serious risk to the natural environment, as it can pollute rivers, drinking water sources, damage biodiversity, and is a threat to the health and safety of both recreational users and the people who live nearby.</p>  <p>  The company advise that it is committed to ensuring that visitors can enjoy visiting its forest parks and trails without the sight of illegally-dumped rubbish and has spent approximately &euro;2 million since 2013 in clean-up operations alone. Coillte further advise that each of Coillte&rsquo;s six Business Area Units has its own dedicated Estates team responsible for the management of important estate issues like dumping with those teams supported by a large number of caretakers spread across the country.</p>  <p>  To specifically deter illegal dumping, Coillte advise that it installs signs, barriers and CCTV at illegal dumping hotspots and is also currently trialling a &lsquo;confidential line&rsquo; which will be displayed on the company website and signage and that the information gathered will be filtered back to the relevant Coillte staff to look into. Coillte adds that it actively investigate all reports of dumping and where evidence is found of those responsible, it is passed on to local authority litter wardens who are responsible for issuing fines and pursuing prosecutions. Coillte advise that it has good working relations with all local authorities to manage and remove dumped material.</p>  <p>  Coillte also advise that, to strengthen these measures, there is also the legal deterrent as Coillte may also apply bye-laws to specific sites. These bye-laws, which I mentioned, prohibit littering, dumping and other antisocial activities. I would remind the Deputy that any person who commits an offence under these bye-laws is liable to a fine and/or imprisonment and these bye-laws may be enforced by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

This resulted in the earlier housing of stock and challenges for some farmers in terms of Fodder conservation.  On foot of these challenges, I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to my request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme and Agri-environment schemes.  These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15th October, and balancing payments issued in early December. </p>  <p>  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, injected over &euro;1.3 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and  are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance fodder purchase where necessary.</p>  <p>  Last autumn as poor weather conditions continued, I then asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties, supporting good budgeting for fodder supplies on farms over the winter ahead.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc.  The group held its first meeting in December and again on Monday of this week.  The group's objective is to actively monitor the situation and to ensure co-ordinated expertise and guidance is available to affected farmers regarding their options.  These may include sourcing alternative feed, reducing non-breeding stock numbers and ensuring they continue to carry out fodder budgeting. </p>  <p>  As outlined at the weekend, my Department is engaging with stakeholders, including through Fodder task force, with a view to providing a targeted contribution towards long-distance transport of fodder to those areas most impacted by the adverse weather.  As the deputy can appreciate, fodder sale and purchase is a normal and significant trade between farms on an annual basis and it is important that any prudent measure brought forward is appropriately targeted to those most impacted whilst not impacting negatively on this trade.  </p>  <p>  I would also stress that if a situation arises where the welfare of livestock is at risk, herdowners should contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Animal Welfare helpline or Regional Veterinary Office for support.</p></reply>

This resulted in the earlier housing of stock and challenges for some farmers in terms of Fodder conservation.  On foot of these challenges, I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  The European Commission agreed to my request, informed in part by the poor weather conditions of last autumn, for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme and Agri-environment schemes.  These payments commenced after the earliest date possible which was 15th October, and balancing payments issued in early December. </p>  <p>  These payments together with those issued under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, injected over &euro;1.3 billion into the Irish rural economy by the end of last year and are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance fodder purchase where necessary.</p>  <p>  Last autumn as poor weather conditions continued, I then asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties, supporting good budgeting for fodder supplies on farms over the winter ahead.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc.  The group held its first meeting in December and again on Monday of this week.  The group's objective is to actively monitor the situation and to ensure co-ordinated expertise and guidance is available to affected farmers regarding their options.  These may include sourcing alternative feed, reducing non-breeding stock numbers and ensuring they continue to carry out fodder budgeting. </p>  <p>  As outlined at the weekend, my Department is engaging with stakeholders, including through Fodder task force, with a view to providing a targeted contribution towards long-distance transport of fodder to those areas most impacted by the adverse weather.  As the deputy can appreciate, fodder sale and purchase is a normal and significant trade between farms on an annual basis and it is important that any prudent measure brought forward is appropriately targeted to those most impacted whilst not impacting negatively on this trade.  </p>  <p>  I would also stress that if a situation arises where the welfare of livestock is at risk, herdowners should contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Animal Welfare helpline or Regional Veterinary Office for support.</p></reply>

My Department has made significant progress in moving towards agreed access in recent years.  Important steps include the lifting of the BSE ban in respect of Irish beef in early 2015, and the systems audit carried out by the Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) in January 2016.  The report for that visit was received following my Trade Mission to China in September 2016.  In April 2017, together with the AQSIQ Minister Zhi Shuping, I signed a Protocol on the requirements for Frozen Beef to be exported from Ireland to China. </p>  <p>  A plant inspection visit by the Chinese Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) took place in August/September of last year. CNCA have recently provided us a draft report on their visit, which is now under consideration by staff in my Department as a matter of priority.  My Department met with the industry last week to discuss the next steps, and will continue to work closely with industry to ensure that the requirements outlined in the Protocol are met.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to liaise closely with their Chinese counterparts to provide every assurance in relation to the quality and safety of Irish beef.  We hope that Ireland is now in the final stages of the market access process with China.  However, despite this significant progress, the pace of market access will be largely determined by the Chinese authorities and not by my Department. </p></reply>

The legal basis for the PSO and its method of calculation by the CRU are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  Typically the CRU publishes, for consultation, a draft of its proposed calculation of the Levy for the subsequent year in early summer with a view to finalisation before the Autumn.</p>  <p>  The levy has been in place since 2001, and consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate national electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply.  Ireland has a target of increasing renewable electricity penetration to 40% by 2020 and to date the PSO has supported the connection of over 3,000 MW of renewable energy to the electricity grid and will continue to support the development of renewable energy so that we can meet our target.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the value for money achieved, international studies have shown that Ireland has had one of the lowest per unit supports for renewable energy in the European Union.  The PSO currently represents around 10% of the average household final electricity bill, or approximately &euro;7.69 on a monthly basis for domestic customers from October 2017.</p>  <p>  All schemes funded through the PSO were notified to the European Commission for state aid approval supported by economic assessment of the amount of aid required.</p></reply>

The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure. </p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced.  Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances.  Consequently, a pure kilogramme charge for waste collection may not be selected by some households.  Instead, some households may use a &lsquo;per lift&rsquo; type charge or a &lsquo;weight allowance&rsquo; collection service.  </p><p>An annual support of &euro;75 will be introduced as soon as possible this year and made available for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence.  This will help people meet the average annual cost of disposal of medical incontinence products.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.3438.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600115#WRFFF04700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1259 and 1260 together. </p><p>Providing telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator.  I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations.  The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at <i>consumerline@comreg.ie</i>and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator. </p><p>Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July 2016, I established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. </p><p>The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce the December 2016 report available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This includes ComReg, who attend as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in their role as the independent Regulator.  Three meetings of the Implementation Group were held in 2017  on 8 March, 5 July and 22 November. </p><p>I published the third Taskforce Quarterly Progress Report in November 2017, which demonstrates that good progress has been made in delivering the actions.  I plan to publish an Annual Report shortly.  These reports show continuing progress and also the sustained level of engagement between actions owners and industry.  The Annual Report will also contain a work programme for 2018, with new actions identified that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland. </p><p>The positive engagement between action owners and industry was clear in October 2017 at the first National Stakeholder Forum in Athlone, which I hosted with Minister Kyne.  It arose from the Taskforce&rsquo;s recognition that, given the rapid technological change and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, stakeholders needed an opportunity to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services.  Issues impacting on rollout were discussed at the Forum, and there were also some new recommended actions for the Taskforce to help improve services to consumers and in preparing for roll-out of the National Broadband Plan network, once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include: </p><p>- Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer;  </p><p>- Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies, including Government working closely with local authorities to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs to be connected at an early juncture after award of the NBP contract; </p><p>- ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing products and network services.  ComReg will also develop a new network coverage map. </p><p>- Most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development. </p><p>- Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out.  TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms. </p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.  Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p><p>In terms of tackling broadband deficiencies, the Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that today over 67% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband and this is set to increase to 77% (1.8m premises) by the end of 2018 and to 90% (2.1m premises) by the end of 2020.</p><p>In April 2017, I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie.  </i>This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode: </p><p>- The  AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing  procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018 as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017.</p><p>All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

By 2020 it is expected that 90% of premises in Ireland will have access to high speed broadband.</p><p>In  April 2017, I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie.</i>This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:  </p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018 as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April.</p><p>The map shows that the provision of high speed broadband in County Donegal will be realised through mix of commercial investment and through the State Intervention under the NBP.  There are over 101,000 premises in County Donegal, over 67,000 of which fall within a BLUE area and will be covered by commercial operators.  Of the 67,000 premises that fall to be covered commercially, almost 12,000 premises form part of eir's planned rural deployment.  The remaining 33,000 premises in County Donegal fall within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  </p><p>I note that the townland of Donegal town, as identified in the High Speed Broadband Map, includes approximately 514 premises, located in the BLUE area.  Therefore commercial operators are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services to this townland.</p><p>Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises (including more than 33,000 premises in County Donegal) that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority.  In the public procurement process, the NBP specialist team is continuing its evaluation of the two bidders&rsquo; Detailed Solutions&rsquo; received in September last.  This is the last stage of the procurement process before moving to the final tender stage early this year, and subsequently the appointment of a preferred bidder or bidders.  My Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the NBP contract. </p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, the Government has made &euro;30m available in State funding to An Post to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service. </p>  <p>  The strategic plan harnesses the company's existing strengths such as its nationwide reach, trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with communities, both rural and urban.  At the same time, An Post has recognised that it must embrace the digital agenda and this is reflected in the plan, especially in the emphasis on growing the parcels business.  Enhanced banking services are becoming available through the post office network with the smart bank account.  It is expected that further such opportunities will be available across the network, especially as high-speed broadband becomes widely available through the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  The Government has also committed to exploring the potential for extra Government business, including motor tax, to be channelled through the network and my Department is engaging with other relevant Government Departments in this regard. </p>  <p>  Discussions on the future of the post office network are a matter for An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union.  I understand discussions are ongoing between both parties and I continue to encourage the parties to work closely to find an agreed solution to the renewal of the network. </p></reply>

Economic analysis conducted by the Department at the time clearly indicated that, under agreed policy and regulatory conditions, renewable energy trading could deliver significant economic benefits to Ireland and the UK, as well as being attractive to developers.  However, subsequent to this, given the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved, and some key decisions that were not taken by the UK to progress energy trading, delivery of renewable energy trading with the UK by 2020 is not considered a realistic proposition and the matter has not progressed any further since then.   </p></reply>

It is proposed as a 500km long (subsea), 700MW high voltage direct current line that would run from the north-west coast of France to Ireland&rsquo;s south coast.  At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes.  The Celtic Interconnector has the potential to provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that would have significant benefits for the people of Ireland.  The project would provide access to the European electricity market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland.  It would also improve security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via export access to the mainland European markets.</p>  <p>  Assessment by EirGrid via independent consultants has comprehensively examined two potential landing points, east Cork and west Wexford.  The anlaysis suggested that an east Cork connection point may be more efficient and EirGrid have shared the findings of the assessment via public consultation. </p>  <p>  There remain a number of potential landing sites being considered under the current phase of the project and convertor stations would need to be built at either end of the line.  I understand that EirGrid's consultants have carried out a variety of land studies considering environmental, technical and planning constraints in their consideration of landing and connection points.  In addition, whilst a full marine study of the potentail route has already been undertaken, further marine studies near the shore are planned. EirGrid has also carried out a social impact assessment screening process that has led to a formal social impact assessment of the project.  Naturally, EirGrid as project promoter would have to meet all environmental and planning requirements in progressing the project.  </p>  <p>  The project is currently in the initial design and pre-consultation phase and there are a variety of approvals required including regulatory and planning consents, before construction could commence.  The interconnector is currently planned to be operational in 2025-26. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.3495.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600116#WRGGG03800"><p>The Government&rsquo;s first energy poverty strategy -the Affordable Energy Strategy used the expenditure method of calculating energy poverty.  This looks at the proportion of household income (net of housing costs) that is devoted to meeting energy needs.  If a household needs to spend more than 10% of their income on energy they are considered to be in energy poverty, with the severity of energy poverty increasing as the proportion of income spent on energy increases.  It was calculated in that strategy that slightly over 20% of all households in the State were potentially in energy poverty in 2009.  There are limitations to the expenditure method of calculating energy poverty.  In particular, analysing what people actually spend on energy may deliver an inadequate picture of energy poverty since many of those in energy poverty may be living in homes that are inadequately heated.  The Government&rsquo;s second, and current Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty2016-2019, was accompanied by the publication of an assessment of the level, and extent, of energy poverty in Ireland using an objective methodology.  This methodology looked at modelled fuel expenditure as a proportion of income using Household Budget Survey data adjusted for inflation, data from the BER register and a residential building stock model developed by Element Energy on behalf of SEAI.  This was used to estimate the percentage of households in particular categories (e.g. living in detached houses) whose required energy spend (required to keep their home adequately heated) exceeds certain thresholds (10%, 15%, 20%).  This analysis which is available at found that 28% of households in Ireland could be in energy poverty, and that social housing and homes heated via oil and solid fuels are more likely to be in energy poverty.</p><p>In terms of comparable countries the EU-wide Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) asks respondents whether they were unable to keep their household adequately warm.  The latest data from the SILC finds that 5.8% of people surveyed in Ireland reported in 2016 that they were unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, a decrease on the 2015 figure of 9%.  This is below the EU average of 8.7% and slightly below the UK figure of 6.1%.  One advantage of using a subjective measure of energy poverty like this question in the SILC is that it is undertaken annually and is conducted EU-wide.  This facilitates comparisons across EU states, providing a benchmark for Government efforts in addressing energy poverty.  However, self-reported energy poverty may give misleading impressions to policy makers on the extent of energy poverty.  The findings of the SILC, and the study for the current Strategy referenced above yield very different results and points to the need for further work to increase our understanding of the extent of energy poverty in Ireland.  My Department is planning to undertake this work in 2018.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s clean energy legislation package, currently under negotiation,will form the basis for energy policy in the EU post 2020.  The package includes related proposals on energy poverty, including a requirement on Member States to measure and report on national objectives with regard to energy poverty, as well as the number of households affected by energy poverty.  Ireland has been supportive of this proposal.  If it is accepted it will mean that there will be more robust measurement of levels of energy poverty.  This will facilitate better comparisons across Member States as well as sharing of best practice in how to alleviate it.</p></reply>

Ireland has met and exceeded the overall packaging waste recovery rate and the recycling rate targets since they came into force.  The most recent Waste Packaging Statistics for Ireland, published by the EPA in May 2016, show that Ireland&rsquo;s recovery rate has gone from 70% in 2009 to 88% in 2013; and Ireland&rsquo;s recycling rate has gone from 65% in 2009 to 70% in 2013.</p><p>My role as Minister is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework to ensure that, <i>inter alia</i>,  waste is managed in line with the waste hierarchy, whereby the prevention, preparing for reuse, recycling and recovery of waste are prioritised over the landfill of waste.</p><p>The collection and processing of waste, including recyclable waste, is largely undertaken by the private sector.  Up until last year, different collectors accepted different items for recycling, which lead to some confusion on which items go in which bin.  Now however, following co-operation between my Department, the regulatory authorities, the waste industry, Repak and environmental NGOs, we have a single, standard national list of items and materials that can be placed in the recycle bin.  Removing confusion will play a huge role in improving the quality of the material presented for recycling.  This will help to ensure that these items are actually recycled, as opposed to being contaminated accidentally by householders and sent to landfill.</p><p>Supporting householders to 'do the right thing' in terms of recycling is important.  In addition to simplifying the household recycle bin, this is also being achieved though awareness and education initiatives such as the <i>Recycling Ambassadors Programme </i>and <i>recyclinglistireland.ie.  </i>These measures will reduce contamination rates and ensure higher quality recycling, reduce our impact on the environment and leave Ireland in a more competitive position in terms of securing markets for our recyclate.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, recycling in Ireland and indeed across the world is evolving.  The finalisation of the Circular Economy package and the Strategy on Plastics at EU level in the coming weeks, as well as our ambitious national waste policy which aims to prevent and recycle more waste, means that all matters recycling related, including the 'recycling list', will be kept under review in conjunction with the key stakeholders. </p></reply>

The Accelerated Capacity Allowances scheme is a tax incentive whereby businesses can offset the cost of investment in qualifying energy technologies against their tax liabilities in year one rather than over eight years, thus aiding their cash flow.  The scheme currently covers 10 different equipment categories and 52 associated technologies.  This includes renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, biomass boilers and solar thermal collectors.</p>  <p>  The Excellence in Energy Efficient Design programme provides advice and support leading to certification for businesses to establish a systematic approach to design, construction, and commissioning processes for new investments and upgrades to existing assets.  This scheme has delivered impressive efficiency improvements in recent years.  Results achieved over the 2016-17 period show average energy efficiencies of 28% being achieved.  </p>  <p>  The Better Energy Communities programme is open to applications that include businesses.  Under this scheme, community based partnerships can apply for funding to upgrade the energy performance of a range of homes, community facilities and businesses in a local community.  As well as energy efficiency measures, renewable technologies such as solar panels are supported under this scheme.  The scheme has supported more than 300 community energy projects over the last five years throughout the country.  There is &euro;28 million available in grant supports for community energy projects under the 2018 scheme.  The closing date for applications is 26 January 2018.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 contained a package of measures to support the increased deployment of electric vehicles.  One of those measures aimed specifically at businesses is the new Benefit-in-Kind 0% rate to incentivise EVs without mileage conditions with the stated intention of continuing the incentive for a minimum of three years.  The rules will also ensure that there is no Benefit-in-Kind liability associated with recharging electric vehicles in workplaces.  In addition, the Electric Vehicle Public Engagement Programme currently being developed by the SEAI will include commercial fleet trials as well as an awareness campaign to highlight the benefits of electric vehicles and the supports that are available.</p>  <p>  My Department is developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contribution to EU-wide targets out to 2030.  The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, including Solar PV, Anaerobic Digestion, Wind Energy at various scales including small and micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  I recently announced the planned introduction of a Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.  The scheme is designed to financially support the replacement of fossil fuel heating systems with renewable energy for commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating, public sector and other non-domestic businesses.  The scheme will consist of two types of support mechanism &ndash; an operational support (paid for up to 15 years) for biomass heating systems or anaerobic digestion heating systems; and a grant to support investment in renewable heating systems that use heat pumps.  The scheme will contribute to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy and emission reduction targets.  In addition, by providing a market for crops such as biomass and waste products from forestry, agriculture and food production, the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat presents a key opportunity for the domestic bioenergy sector.  This will have significant benefits for farmers, foresters and rural communities.  </p></reply>

The table shows details of the number of electric vehicles supported each year, the cost in that year, the breakdown between BEVs and PHEVs, and the average grant amount per vehicle.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No of Grants</th><th>Amount (Euro)</th><th>% BEVs</th><th>% PHEVs</th><th>Average grant amount per vehicle (Euro)</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>42</td><td>198,000</td><td>100%</td><td>0%</td><td>4,714</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>183</td><td>767,400</td><td>100%</td><td>0%</td><td>4,193</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>53</td><td>242,200</td><td>98%</td><td>2%</td><td>4,570</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>257</td><td>1,203,400</td><td>86%</td><td>14%</td><td>4,682</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>555</td><td>2,647,800</td><td>85%</td><td>15%</td><td>4,771</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>638</td><td>3,038,800</td><td>61%</td><td>39%</td><td>4,763</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>908</td><td>4,262,000</td><td>68%</td><td>32%</td><td>4,694</td></tr></table></p><p>The grant scheme will continue with &euro;6 million allocated in my Department&rsquo;s budget this year.  This provides a 40% increase on the level of expenditure in 2017. The scheme will be kept under review in relation to funding and grant amounts for future years.  As the purchase grant scheme is demand-led it is not possibly to accurately predict how many vehicles will be supported in future years.  </p><p>Budget 2018 also contained a number of new measures to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles.  </p><p>The new Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant scheme , which came into operation on 1 January 2018, supports the cost of installing a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600.  Up to the end of 2017, the ESB, through its eCars programme, had provided home charge points to purchasers of new electric vehicles. The new grant scheme applies to both new and second hand BEVs and PHEVs. </p><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are currently developing an Electric Vehicle Public Engagement Programme which will include an awareness campaign; a driver experience roadshow which will give people the opportunity to drive an electric vehicle and experience the benefits for themselves; and public sector and commercial fleet trials. This programme will be rolled out throughout 2018. </p><p>Funding has also been allocated to support the provision of public charging, with a particular focus on increasing the number of rapid chargers. </p><p>The allocations provided for these three measures in 2018 are listed in the table.  As these measures are new initiatives, no budget allocations were provided in previous years.<table><tr><th>2018 allocations</th><th>Current (&euro;m)</th><th>Capital (&euro;m)</th><th>Total (&euro;m)</th></tr><tr><td>Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant</td><td>0.1</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Electric Vehicle Public Charging Support</td><td>0.3</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Electric Vehicle Public Awareness Programme</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.8</td></tr></table></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The ESB, through its eCars programme, has rolled out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points for electric vehicles.  There are approximately 900 EV charge points in Ireland of which circa 70 are rapid chargers.  </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In March 2014, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities approved an application from ESB Networks to recover the costs of a pilot project to a maximum of &euro;25 million from use of system charges to cover the rollout of this infrastructure.  Following a public consultation process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published its independent regulatory decision in relation to the ownership of this infrastructure in October 2017.  A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges.  This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Commission for Regulation of Utilities also envisages the future sale of the infrastructure by ESB Networks.  However, the continued ownership of the charging network by ESB Networks for a transitional period of up to ten years is provided for.  This ensures no short to medium term impact on the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and allows the ESB to continue to provide electric vehicle charging across Ireland.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The decision also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis. </font>Currently, recharging electric vehicles at public charge points is free and unlimited.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that free fuel for electric vehicles, funded by electricity consumers, is not sustainable in the longer term as the number of EVs increases.  At the same time, it is important that if payments for use of public charge points are introduced in the future, they are at a level which does not disincentivise the uptake of electric vehicles.</p><p>The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles.  A key focus of the work of the Taskforce is examining options for infrastructure, regulation and pricing in order to devise a sustainable policy framework for effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.  This includes examining options for providing convenient charging for apartment dwellers and other homeowners who do not have access to off street parking.</p></reply>

This report was commissioned by the then Minister for the Environment John Gormley.  It reported on a deposit and refund scheme stating &ldquo;the evidence is not sufficiently strong to support a recommendation of this nature, principally because the information regarding implementation costs is not such that the costs can be said to unequivocally justify the benefits&rdquo;.</p><p>In July 2014, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Phil Hogan published a Review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative model in Ireland.  As part of this review, a wider examination of issues within the packaging sphere, which includes bottles, was undertaken and consideration was given to the introduction of a deposit and refund scheme.  The review report did not recommend the introduction of a deposit and refund scheme and concluded that to establish such a scheme was inappropriate, in view of the operation of the existing successful packaging scheme.</p><p>A feasibility study identified - based on practice overseas, previous relevant studies, and stakeholder consultations &ndash; the projected financial implications of introducing a deposit and refund scheme in Scotland. The identified costs are:</p><p>- One-off set up costs = &pound;15m sterling</p><p>- Machine take back (p.a.) = &pound;29m </p><p>- Manual take back (p.a.) = &pound;8m </p><p>- Logistics (p.a.) = &pound;20m </p><p>- Counting centres (p.a.) = &pound;3m </p><p>- Administration (p.a.) = &pound;3m</p><p>That is &pound;78 million pounds sterling &ndash; in excess of &euro;88 million.</p><p>Deputy Eamon Ryan and Green Party Leader when introducing a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on the subject, suggested a deposit and refund scheme would cost &euro;276 million to implement in Ireland.  A study investigating the possible introduction in the UK puts a figure of &euro;790 million per year.  </p><p>There is a lack of clarity around the costs associated with the introduction of a deposit and return scheme.  Without a complete understanding of the cost implications on the taxpayer, on employers, on retailers and on customers it would be financially reckless of me to proceed with its introduction here without proper scrutiny.  Our national approach to date for dealing with waste packaging has been based around the Extended Producer Responsibility principle &ndash; EPR.  EPR seeks to ensure that the producer of a product bears a significant portion of the cost of dealing with the waste disposal of the product they supply.  In Ireland this has been done very effectively through a producer funded compliance scheme, operated by Repak.  Similar schemes operate in other waste streams such as batteries, waste electronic and electrical goods, farm plastics and end-of-life vehicles. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, on foot of a Private Members Bill tabled by Deputy Ryan, I have asked the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to look at the merits of a deposit and refund scheme at a national level in the context of the associated costs and the contribution it could make in achieving our national waste targets under EU legislation. </p><p>In a 2014 Review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative model, it was concluded that Ireland has achieved significant progress in recent years in recovering and recycling packaging waste.</p></reply>

The amount of the reduction would be contingent on the overall level of licence fee receipts.</p>  <p>  The proposals also provide for the introduction of a new funding scheme to offer bursaries to journalists working in local or community radio stations.  The proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Act, 2009 only relate to the broadcasting sector as I have no statutory function under the Broadcasting Act, 2009 in relation to print media.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, the proposed amendments are currently being considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment under Pre-Legislative Scrutiny and I look forward to receiving the Committee&rsquo;s report as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal which compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. A public consultation on the new Scheme, which closed in November 2017, resulted in over 1,200 responses which are being analysed currently.</p>  <p>  Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and the selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed. These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p>  <p>  I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation could have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country. In October 2017 my Department and SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation which discussed a number of these challenges with relevant stakeholders including the IFA.  A micro renewable obligation scheme similar to the one in place in Northern Ireland was one of the policy proposals identified at the workshop and my intention is to shortly develop a policy position on how best to support micro generation and micro generators in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the 2017 Finance Bill introduced taxation changes vis-a-vis the treatment of agricultural land with regard to solar panels which are likely to also benefit the agricultural sector.</p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.</p><p>Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. In July 2016, I established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.</p><p>The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce the December 2016 report available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, who attend as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in their role as the independent Regulator.</p><p>I published the third Taskforce Quarterly Progress Report in November 2017, which demonstrates that good progress has been made in delivering the actions.  I plan to publish an Annual Report shortly. These reports show continuing progress and also the sustained level of engagement between actions owners and industry.  The Annual Report will also contain a work programme for 2018, with new actions identified that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland.</p><p>In terms of addressing blackspots, there are several actions in the 2016 Report which aim to improve mobile coverage:</p><p>- Under Action 17, my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with more local authorities now being asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise will be included in the 2018 Work Programme.</p><p>- Under Action 40, my Department identified recommendations to address blackspots, including the initiation of a focus group to identify specific categories of locations where high quality mobile coverage should be available, to inform future policy development and initiatives. This focus group will be included in the 2018 Work Programme.</p><p>- Action 29 concerns the delivery of a composite national coverage map by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), in quarter 4 of 2018. Work to deliver this is a matter for ComReg in its capacity as the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector.</p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that today over 67% of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband and this is set to increase to 77% (1.8 million premises) by the end of 2018 and to 90% (2.1 million premises) by the end of 2020.</p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP).</p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The  AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing  procurement process.</p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>- The Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of 2018 as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April.</p><p>There are approximately 270,000 premises in Cork. Just under 75,000 (28%) fall within the AMBER area and will be covered under the State led Intervention. Approximately 173,000 (64%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are, or will be, covered by commercial providers, while nearly 21,000 (8%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment. A document containing a townland by townland breakdown of premises into these three categories is attached. Individuals can visit my Department&rsquo;s website and input their eircode to find out which category their premises falls under.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now at an advanced stage. &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders last September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team. This is the last stage of the procurement process before moving to the final tender stage which will be followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the rollout by the end of 2018.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment, including timelines, is available at .  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

In the case of Ireland, a target of a 39% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 was proposed, adjusted to 30% to reflect the cost-effectiveness of measures within Ireland&rsquo;s economy.</p>  <p>  The draft Regulation, as published by the Commission, also included a number of provisions for Member States to meet their annual compliance obligations in a flexible manner in the context of maintaining overall progress towards the targets for 2030. These include, subject to certain conditions, mechanisms to bank or borrow excess allowances between individual years, to trade allowances between Member States, to effect a transfer of allowances from the ETS to the non-ETS sector, and to take into account the climate mitigation impact of net removals of emissions from deforested land, afforested land, managed cropland and managed grassland towards a Member State&rsquo;s compliance with its targets.</p>  <p>  Provisional agreements were reached on the draft Effort Sharing and LULUCF Regulations between the Council and the European Parliament in December 2017. These agreements must now be formally confirmed by both institutions.</p>  <p>  The provisional agreement on the Effort Sharing Regulation maintains the overall approach to establishing Member State targets based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness as well as the mechanisms providing a flexible approach to compliance as set out above.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the outcome of the negotiations on these regulations confirms the high environmental ambition of the original Commission proposals, while providing appropriate recognition of different Member State circumstances and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target. The agreed outcome does not in any way diminish the significant challenge that will be required over the period to 2030 for each Member State to meet its respective targets.</p></reply>

Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.</p>  <p>  My role, as Minister, is to provide the legislative and policy framework under which both local authority and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcement action against illegal dumping is initiated. Enforcement action against illegal waste activity is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE) of the EPA as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this arrangement, my Department encourages a multi-faceted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education. As such, I introduced an Anti-Dumping Initiative in 2017 to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.

In that regard, I can confirm that I will be making funding available this year to support local authorities and community organisations in building on the momentum that has now been created, to continue to address dumping black spots and target those who show such disregard for their communities and environment.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to launch the 2018 Anti-Dumping Initiative early this year at which point further information will be available from the Environment Section of each local authority for community and voluntary groups who wish to participate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.3565.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600117#WRHHH05100"><p>The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to our major cities. Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.</p><p>Scientific understanding has evolved in the intervening years, however, and numerous studies now indicate that air pollution has impacts on human health at lower levels than was previously understood.  Consequently, it is necessary to continue to strengthen policy to enhance air quality for the protection of people&rsquo;s health and the environment.</p><p>Recent monitoring has also revealed that the air quality in some of our smaller towns in winter is worse than that in larger towns where the ban is in place.  Given the clear human health benefits, I am committed to extending the ban nationwide.</p><p>This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Government Departments and Agencies, the residential fuel industry, and the general public.  Discussions with many of these stakeholders on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban are underway.  My next step will be to introduce the specific legal measures to give effect to the ban over a twelve month period commencing in Autumn 2018.</p><p>In relation to cost, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has published figures comparing the respective costs of domestic fuels.  These are available online at <i><i></i></i>and show that while low smoke fuels are typically more expensive to buy on a weight by weight basis, they have a higher heat output than coal or lignite nuggets.  Low smoke fuels, therefore, represent good value for money.</p></reply>

That procurement process is now at an advanced stage. &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26th September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team. This is the last stage of the procurement process before moving to the final tender stage which will be followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature.</p><p>My Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p><p>With regards to the available fibre connection close to the referred premises, decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the rollout and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis by competing service providers operating in a liberalised market and one in which I have no statutory role.</p><p>I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and the frustration for communities and businesses that do not currently have access to this level of connectivity.  Delivering connectivity to the 542,000 premises that fall within the State led intervention under the NBP remains a Government priority and my Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services.</p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

This framework has, in my view served consumers well over several decades and ensured that householders can get an affordable fixed voice service, regardless of where they are located.</p>  <p>  There is no universal service obligation (USO) for high speed broadband provision or mobile voice services in Ireland. The current EU and national regulatory framework for telecommunications relates solely to voice telephony and Functional Internet Access (28.8 kilobits per second) and is provided for under the current EU regulatory framework governing telecoms.</p>  <p>  There is also no provision in European or national regulation for a USO in relation to mobile voice services.  Mobile operators are however rolling out 3G and 4G networks across Ireland following ComReg&rsquo;s 2012 Multiband Spectrum auction, with at least one operator now having over 90% population coverage of 4G services.</p>  <p>  However, in September 2016, the European Commission published an ambitious new proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector (Proposal for a Directive Establishing a European Electronic Communications Code COM 2016/590), which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.  I have raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level, seeking inclusion of a specific provision in the new framework that would allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available. Negotiations on the initiative remain live at EU level.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased over the last five years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. In July 2016, I established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce the December 2016 report available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. The Implementation Group, that I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.</p>  <p>  I published the third Taskforce Quarterly Progress Report in November 2017, which demonstrates that good progress has been made in delivering the actions. I plan to publish an Annual Report shortly. These reports show continuing progress and also the sustained level of engagement between actions owners and industry.</p>  <p>  This engagement was clear in October at first National Stakeholder Forum in Athlone, which I hosted with Minister Kyne.  It arose from the Taskforce&rsquo;s recognition that, given the rapid technological change and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, stakeholders needed an opportunity to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services. Issues impacting on rollout were discussed at the Forum, and there were also some new recommended actions for the Taskforce to help improve services to consumers and in preparing for roll-out of the National Broadband Plan network, once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include:</p>  <p>- Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer;</p>  <p>- Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies, including Government working closely with local authorities to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs to be connected at an early juncture after award of the NBP contract;</p>  <p>- ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing products and network services. ComReg will also develop a new network coverage map.</p>  <p>- Most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development.</p>  <p>- Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out. TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement. In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.</p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States. The specific details of Ireland's contribution are currently being finalised between the EU and its Member States.</p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper &ldquo;Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030&rdquo; sets out a vision and framework to guide Irish energy policy and the actions that Government intends to take in the energy sector from now up to 2030, aimed at transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050. This ambitious vision for Ireland&rsquo;s energy system envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050. The White Paper identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will involve progressively moving to lower emissions fuels, e.g., moving initially from peat and coal to natural gas, and ultimately towards an even greater reliance on renewable energy. In that regard, the Government has introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency. In 2015, over 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was generated from renewable energy sources. </p>  <p>  The White Paper also recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.  </p>  <p>  Ireland sources all its oil needs from abroad. In addition, Ireland currently sources its gas supply from the Kinsale gasfields, the Corrib gasfield and the gas pipeline from Moffat in Scotland. Corrib and Kinsale are not in a position to meet all of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas demand and so Ireland will continue to rely on gas via Great Britain for the foreseeable future. The Kinsale fields are expected to cease production by 2021 while Corrib production is projected to decrease to 50 per cent of its initial levels by 2025.</p>  <p>  Taking this into account, exploration in Ireland&rsquo;s offshore has the potential to deliver benefits to Irish society and the economy, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply and reduced fossil fuel imports, as we transition to a low carbon future. In that regard, I recently made a suggestion to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that Ireland's policy on energy security deserves a full debate by the committee in the context of our policy framework for energy transition, energy efficiency, renewable energy and offshore exploration. </p></reply>

Prior to granting approval, the application to survey from TGS was considered against a range of technical and environmental considerations. In respect of environmental requirements, the company was required to submit an Environmental Risk Assessment and a Natura Impact Screening (Appropriate Assessment) Statement in support of its application to commence surveying activities, and these were considered in the context of the likely effects on the environment of the proposed survey.</p><p>A review was undertaken for my Department by Bec Consultants, an independent consultancy appointed for their expertise in ecological and conservation marine biology to <i>inter alia</i></p><p>- examine the submitted Environmental Statement and assess whether or not it met the scope and quality of requirements set out or implied by the specific European and Irish Environmental Impact Assessment legislation and guidelines;</p><p>- appraise the Environmental Statement, highlighting any deficiencies in respect of the statutory requirements of the Statement and detailing the outcome and resolution of any such deficiencies; and</p><p>- ensure that the requirements of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations, 2011, for an assessment to be carried out on any plan or project likely to have a significant effect on a protected site or species were met by the Appropriate Assessment Screening Report. </p><p>In addition, the National Parks and Wildlife Service was requested to provide its observations in terms of Natura 2000 sites, where relevant, and Annex IV species (Cetaceans) in accordance with the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).</p><p>It was a condition of the survey that daily Marine Mammal Observer reports be submitted to my Department for review.</p><p>The documentation associated with this environmental assessment is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

A combination of practical factors and market forces would dictate that where a local demand exists, a discovery will be landed and sold locally to ensure maximum recovery from the field and to reduce the cost of transportation. This has been the practice to date, with all commercial finds (Kinsale Head, Ballycotton, Seven Heads and Corrib) having been delivered into the Irish market. In all cases, the State&rsquo;s fiscal regime applies to the production of gas in the Irish offshore.</p></reply>

The rationale is to have a price that reflects global macroeconomic projections.</p><p>The oil prices used in the 2017 are as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2017 Projections</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>$2013 barrel of oil equivalent</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>48.3</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>56.8</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>69.4</td></tr></table>Note the prices are based in constant 2013 values as that is the base year used for all prices in COSMO.</p><p>Also note that the values quoted are the annual weighted average prices.</p><p>In terms of security of supply of oil, long standing  policy has been to ensure that oil and oil products are available in the event of an emergency. In this regard Ireland holds 90 days of emergency oil stocks, in accordance with International Energy Agency (IEA) rules and EU legislation, to be used in the event of a supply disruption.</p><p>The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), which is under the aegis of my Department, is responsible for acquiring and managing Ireland&rsquo;s 90 days of emergency oil stocks and does so within  the oil market.  NORA is funded by way of the NORA levy, which is currently 2c per litre of oil or oil product consumed.  NORA monitors the price of oil on the markets and factors pricing concerns into purchasing decisions when sourcing oil to maintain its 90-day stockholding.</p></reply>

The terms and conditions under which any such authorisation is granted are set out in the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development and Production 1992 and 2007 and in the authorisation instrument itself.   Exploration authorisations, in particular, Licensing Options and Exploration Licences, are granted subject to an agreed work programme, the progress of which is monitored by my Department.</p>  <p>  Progression from Licensing Option to Exploration Licence and between the individual phases of an Exploration Licence, is dependent upon fulfilment by the authorisation holder of its existing work programme obligations, and consideration by my Department of the authorisation holder's proposed work programme for the next phase of the Exploration Licence, and its capacity to undertake same. Occasionally there may be practical and logistical reasons why commitments may not be delivered within a certain period of time and each such case is considered on its merits with a view to delivering the objectives of the work programme. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that one of the criteria for consideration of an application for an exploration authorisation contained in the Licensing Terms is the previous performance by the applicant under any authorisation to which the applicant has been a party.</p></reply>

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme.Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation, Zone B: the Cork conurbation, Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000, and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland.</p><p>Ireland currently has a nationwide network of 30 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones. This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at . The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone. Currently Dublin has 14 monitoring stations. </p><p>Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to develop a new Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme which aims to enhance and build on current arrangements. The new national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme is being developed under Section 65 of the EPA Act, 1992 as amended. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public.  The statutory basis for the programme underlines the importance placed on air quality monitoring in Ireland.  The Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme covers the years 2017 to 2022, with the enhancement and expansion of the monitoring network to be prioritised in the first phases of the programme. Further details on the timeframes for the expansion of the network will be released as they become available. I fully support this important initiative, and have committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme.</p><p>In relation to specific development sites, environmental management conditions may be imposed by the relevant local authority, or an An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as the case may be.</p></reply>

My Department made significant efforts to streamline and simplify the application process on this occasion in order to try and reduce the number of invalid application.  Amongst the measures introduced to reduce the number of invalid applications were the following:</p>  <p>  - Simplification of the application form from 14 pages to 6</p>  <p>  - The organisation of regional workshops to assist applicants completing the form</p>  <p>  - Relaxation of rules around planning permission and quotations at application stage (requirements still stand before any grants will be paid) </p>  <p>  Under previous rounds of the Programme typically one third of all applications were deemed invalid.  For the 2017 round, this was reduced this to one in five.  For the first time, invalid applicants were also given the opportunity to appeal the decision to make them invalid and the review of such appeals is now underway.  My Department is also undertaking a more general review of all invalid applications including those where incorrect or incomplete documentation was submitted.  Improvements to further reduce the level of invalid applications under future rounds of the programme will be taken once these reviews are complete.</p></reply>

When fully implemented the enhancements to the heavy rail system provided for in the NTA's Transport Strategy will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin with all of the lines linked and connected.  This integrated rail network will provide the core high capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Hazelhatch and Greystones. </p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, the Government&rsquo;s budgetary framework for capital investment, as set out in Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, was reviewed last year in the context of the Mid-Term Review of capital priorities, delivery and funding.  Following this work, Budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for public transport investment between 2018 and 2021. </p>  <p>  This enhanced capital envelope includes funding in the order of &euro;230 million for mainline rail and DART capacity enhancement and will allow acceleration of the initial stages of the overall DART Expansion Programme, focussing particularly at this stage on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity, and extending the electrified DART system. </p>  <p>  Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan - now expected to be delivered in 2022 - and commencing work on the Maynooth line.  The NTA's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035, which provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA over the next two decades, does not envisage an extension of the line beyond Maynooth.  The remaining elements of the DART Expansion programme including the extension to Drogheda are being considered in the context of the 10 year investment plan that is expected to be published in the near future.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA&rsquo;s responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputies' questions to the Authority for further information on the issues raised.  Please advise my private office if the Deputies do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

This amount is fully committed for ongoing projects in Kildare, Meath, Waterford, Galway and Kerry.</p>  <p>  I will be in a position to announce a new funding call for greenways following the completion of the Greenway Strategy, which is currently being developed in my Department and which I hope to publish in the first quarter of this year.  The funding call to local authorities will be a competitive process and proposals submitted will be assessed based on criteria set out in the funding call.  I anticipate that decisions regarding projects to be funded will be taken around the end of 2018. </p>  <p>  Under the recent mid-term review of the Capital Plan I was pleased to secure an additional &euro;30m for greenways bringing the total available investment for the period 2018 to 2021 to almost &euro;56m.</p>  <p>  Matters concerning the purchase of land for greenway development are for local authorities.  If there is a requirement to purchase land the local authority should include the cost of land purchase as part of any application submitted to my Department under the next funding call.   </p>  <p>  My advice to local authorities intending to submit proposals under the next funding call is to advance all statutory, planning and land purchase requirements to the greatest degree possible so as to be well placed to compete.  It will be important that consultation with landowners begins at an early stage in the process to find an agreed route that will minimise the impact on landowners business either through the routing of the greenway or through accommodation works.</p>  <p>  For completeness of information, I can inform the Deputy that my Department will also allocate &euro;8m to the National Transport Authority (NTA) in 2018 towards the development of urban cycling and walking infrastructure.  Whilst the exact amounts to be allocated to individual schemes are currently being finalised between the NTA and the relevant local authorities, there are a number of greenway-type schemes likely to be included under this funding stream such as sections of the Royal Canal in Dublin City, Fingal and Co. Kildare; the Grand Canal in Dublin City; the Dodder Greenway in Dublin City and South Dublin; and the Lee Valley in Cork City.</p>  <p>  My Department is also part-funding a number of cross-border greenways in Donegal, Monaghan and Louth as part of the EU INTERREG VA Sustainable Transport Programme; the funding amount from my Department towards this programme is likely to be approximately &euro;100,000 in 2018.  A further &euro;150,000 has been allocated to Transport Infrastructure Ireland to progress design work on the pedestrian and cycle bridge in Athlone that forms part of the Galway to Dublin Greenway.</p></reply>

This included an examination of the issue raised by you.  A copy of the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report and subsequent updates can be found here - <i><i>.</i></i></p><p>The Cost of Insurance Working Group Report commented that an &lsquo;older vehicle may have a greater risk of injury due to its lack of safety features compared to a modern vehicle&rsquo; (See Point 2.4 Underwriting Risks and Coverages, Section vii. Vehicle details on page 29 of the Report).  Research by the Road Safety Authority indicates that in the event of a collision, the level of personal injury to an individual in an older car can be significantly higher than if that person was driving a new car.  Safety features on newer cars can include greater use of airbags, electronic stability, improved braking systems, roll-over protection, etc., all of which are designed to reduce the impact of a collision on the occupants.  A higher overall level of personal injury payout may be one factor that leads some insurance companies to consider older cars a higher risk in terms of potential payouts when considering the underwriting of a policy.</p></reply>

While some changes were made to the scoring system for the 2017 round of the SCP, no alterations were made to the scores awarded for ball stop netting.  The assessment process and scoring system is primarily designed to reward projects:</p><p>- that have a positive impact on participation, </p><p>- that are being proposed by clubs/organisations that have not received significant funding in the past, </p><p>- that are from disadvantaged areas, and </p><p>- that promote sharing of facilities</p><p>Ball stop netting is clearly more relevant for certain sports due to the nature of the sports themselves.  In this regard, the necessity for ball stop netting for gaelic games was deemed to be particularly strong due to the fact that gaelic footballs and sliotars regularly get kicked and pucked higher and further away from goal posts in comparison to other field sports.  Accordingly, it was decided that these applications could receive a higher mark than non-GAA applications.  While I consider the overall scoring system for the SCP to be reasonable and fair, all aspects of it will be reviewed prior to the next round of the SCP.</p></reply>

The new Unit was formally approved on 30<sup>th</sup>June 2015.  An extensive consultation process was followed in order to assuage concerns raised by existing members.  A building was renovated in Waterville as an administrative centre for the new Unit.  This building was opened by the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny on 27<sup>th</sup>March 2017.</p><p>Despite numerous requests by the Coast Guard, several members of the now-defunct Waterville Unit refused to enrol in the Iveragh Unit.  Following the official opening of the Stationhouse the members in question had further opportunities to enrol which they were not prepared to do.  This left the Coast Guard with no option but to reluctantly terminate their membership.  The Unit has now completed its establishment and intensive training is ongoing to make it a fully operational Search and Cliff Rescue Unit.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware last year I committed publicly to further increasing Public Service Obligation (PSO) funding levels in the future as resources allowed.  PSO subvention increased in both 2016 and 2017 and will increase yet further this year. In Budget 2018 I secured an 8% increase in the overall Exchequer funding available for PSO services throughout the country.  nThis means that in 2018 &euro;285 million will be allocated via the National Transport Authority (NTA) to support the continued delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services that have grown in recent years.</p>  <p>  Public Service Obligation (PSO) subvention provided in 2008 - the year of record funding - was &euro;308 million.  Therefore the total funding committed toward the PSO programme in 2018 now stands at approximately 93% of the 2008 figure.</p>  <p>  As is normal, the precise allocations to the companies will be decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.</p></reply>

I said that CI&Eacute; was on record at the WRC that it will not impose any change that it proposes without the agreement of the active members of both schemes and that it will continue to contribute to both schemes in accordance with the rules of the schemes. I am informed that this remains CI&Eacute;'s position in order to bring about a set of proposals that could form the basis of the trustees' submission to the Pensions Authority and that it continues to engage with the WRC.</p>  <p>  Seperately, the Deputy is asking about a decision of the Pensions Committee, which consists of four CI&Eacute; Board appointed members and four employee elected members. The legal structure of CI&Eacute;&rsquo;s Scheme for management and administrative personnel bestows certain trustee powers and responsibilities on the Committee of this Scheme.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a notification issued to members across the CI&Eacute; group following the Committee&rsquo;s decision on 9 May 2017 concerning early retirement discount factors which came into effect on 1 January 2018. This change was made by the Committee under the Scheme&rsquo;s rules which clearly attribute this power to the Committee alone without the need to refer or seek approval from the Minister. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is also asking about CIE adherence to the requirements of Statutory Instruments 323 of 2000 and 205 of 2010. CI&Eacute; has advised that it has complied with its contribution requirements under these Statutory Instruments. Also, the Deputy may be aware that the Schemes' accounts are independently audited and are required to be signed off by the trustees if they are satisfied that the Rules have been complied with. These audited and trustee approved accounts form part of each Scheme&rsquo;s Annual Report that is circulated to all the members.  To date, no case exists where this has not occurred.</p></reply>

These include Quality Bus Corridors, road safety and accessibility schemes and traffic management projects throughout the GDA and will allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and will help relieve traffic congestion.</p>  <p>  Over &euro;110 million will also be invested in new urban cycling and walking routes which will provide additional sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster, higher quality public transport in our main cities.  </p>  <p>  The Plan also provides investment of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme to address growing congestion in the Dublin region in the short to medium term. Bus Connects will provide a greatly enhanced bus service across Dublin, with high quality infrastructure, including continuous bus lanes as far as is practicable along the busiest bus corridors along with a network of park and ride facilities at key locations, enhanced services and major improvements in ticketing and information, all providing a modern, faster, reliable, convenient and attractive public transport solution.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.  When this work is completed the proposals will be launched for public consultation in the first half of this year.  </p>  <p>  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred your question to the NTA for a more detailed reply with regard to the various projects under these programmes.

Instead, it was recommended that the Port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.</p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest.  The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter.  That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), in conjunction with the Department, has commenced a study into the use of the UK Land-bridge by Irish importers and exporters.  The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK Land-bridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on Land-bridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable.  This piece of research is expected to be completed in Q1 of 2018 and should inform the potential for the future utilisation of all Ports, including Rosslare Europort.</p></reply>

As of the 31st of December 2017 there were 6,605 vehicles registered under the &lsquo;State Owned, Emergency Vehicles and Rescue Vehicles&rsquo;<i></i>tax classification.  The Deputy should note that this definition potentially omits some state/public vehicles that are not registered under this tax exemption category.  Based on this definition, the following table summaries the number of hybrid and fully electric &ldquo;State Vehicles&rdquo; registered from 2015 to 2017.<table><tr><th colspan="4">Relief</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>31st   Dec 2017</td><td>31st   Dec 2016</td><td>31st   Dec 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Total State Owned</td><td>6,605</td><td>6,474</td><td>6,162</td></tr><tr><td>Petrol Electric</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Electric</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr></table></p><p>As the Deputy is aware, to date the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) in Ireland has been relatively low.  There are a range of factors accepted internationally as being barriers to transition to EV technology including limited vehicle choice, range anxiety and low consumer awareness.  This slower than anticipated transition to EVs is not Ireland-specific and does not indicate a lack of ambition or support. Increasing range performances, technology advancements, greater affordability and improved consumer choice will be the greatest levers in triggering large-scale change.</p><p>The Government is, of course, very supportive of the transition to EVs.  My Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, have jointly convened an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Task Force to consider a full suite of potential measures to expedite the deployment of low carbon technologies, especially the uptake of EVs. Recommendations from the Taskforce were considered in the budgetary process; subsequently a generous package of measures to promote the uptake of electric vehicles was announced in Budget 2018.  Current incentives include the following: <table><tr><th>VRT Relief</th><th>Continuation of VRT relief in 2018- Up to &euro;5,000 for new EVs until end 2021 and up to &euro;2,500 for new PHEVs.</th></tr><tr><td>SEAI Grant Scheme</td><td>Continuation of SEAI Purchase Grant in  2018- Up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new EV or PHEV.</td></tr><tr><td>Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA)</td><td>EVs and charging infrastructure are qualifying equipment under the ACA scheme.</td></tr><tr><td>Charging Supports</td><td>A new grant to support installation of home charger points for buyers of new and second-hand EVs from January 1st 2018.</td></tr><tr><td>SPSV Grant Scheme</td><td>A new grant scheme to stimulate take-up of EVs in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector from February 1st 2018.</td></tr><tr><td>0% Benefit-in-Kind (BIK)</td><td>A new BIK 0% rate to incentivise EVs without mileage conditions for at least three years.</td></tr><tr><td>Public Body Procurement</td><td>National Procurement Service to introduce a new public procurement framework contract for EVs in 2018 to allow public bodies to buy EVs with reduced administrative burden.</td></tr><tr><td>Public Engagement Programme</td><td>National awareness campaign; Driver experience roadshow; Public sector and commercial fleet trials; Support for EV use in car sharing trials.</td></tr><tr><td>Toll Incentive Regime</td><td>Funding to support a reduction in tolls for EVs </td></tr></table></p><p>As part of Working Group 1 of the LEV Taskforce &ndash; chaired by my Department - the role of public sector leadership in encouraging EV uptake is being examined. The National Procurement Service are planning to introduce a new public procurement framework contract for EVs in 2018 which would allow public bodies to purchase EVs with reduced administrative burden.  It is expected that this measure will promote greater uptake of EVs within the State Vehicle Fleet. </p></reply>

The Children First Act places the following statutory obligations on providers of relevant services to children: </p><p>- To keep children safe from harm while they are availing of the service [section 10];</p><p>- To carry out a risk assessment to identify potential safeguarding risks which could arise while children are availing of the service [section 11 (1) (a)], and, </p><p>- To develop a Child Safeguarding Statement [section 11 (3)] which must include both the written risk assessment and the policies and procedures which are in place to:</p><p>(i) Manage any risk identified</p><p>(ii) Investigate an allegation against any staff member about any act, omission or circumstance  in respect of a child availing of the service</p><p>(iii) Select and recruit staff who are suitable to work with children</p><p>(iv) Provide information and training to staff on child protection and safeguarding issues</p><p>(v) Enable staff members, whether mandated persons or otherwise, to make a report to Tusla in accordance with the Act, or nay guidelines issued by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</p><p>(vi) Maintain a list of persons in the organisation who are mandated persons under the Act</p><p>(vii) Appoint a relevant person in the organisation for the purposed of the Act. </p><p>A list of the types of organisations which are classified as providers of relevant services to children is set out in Schedule 1 of the Children First Act.  To qualify as a provider of a relevant service under the Act, an organisation must employ at least one other person to provide that service.  Organisations should consult the Schedule to establish if they are a relevant service, and if so, it is a matter for each organisation to satisfy themselves if they have any statutory obligations under the Act, as outlined above, and to discharge those obligations.  As with any regulatory regime, it is a matter for organisations to ensure that they are in compliance with the relevant requirements and to take their own advice as required</p><p>To assist sectors and organisations to fulfil their statutory obligations under the Act, my Department and Tusla have developed a suite of resources to support the full implementation of the Act. This suite of resources was launched on 2nd October 2017, and includes a revised edition of Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children[DCYA 2017] which contains a chapter specifically in relation to the responsibilities of organisations who provide services to children and young people.</p><p>In addition, Tusla has prepared several resource documents in relation to implementation of the Act, including one guidance document specifically in relation to the preparation of child safeguarding statements.  Tusla has also developed a comprehensive Children First e-training module which is universally available, free of charge and which sets out the information required to recognise and report child welfare and protection concerns.  These resources are available on Tusla's website. </p></reply>

It may be the case that individuals eligible for ECCE Higher Capitation are working in the sector but not availing of ECCE Higher Capitation, for various reasons to do the with function of the Early Years setting or their own working role.  There may also be other reasons associated with non-compliance with the ECCE programme, such as not meeting adult:child ratios. </p>  <p>  DCYA is also aware that some services have reduced numbers of children enrolling in ECCE this year, as they are instead availing of the expansion of CCS.  As Higher Capitation is part of the ECCE programme and dependent on ECCE capitation as measured by enrollments, some services may have appropriately qualified staff for which they are not currently receiving ECCE Higher Capitation.  DCYA is considering how best to put in place some mitigation for service providers who find themselves in this situation.</p>  <p>  In the 2016/2017 programme year, the number of services in receipt of ECCE Higher Capitation was 1918. The 2017 / 2018 programme year is still in progress, but I am pleased to confirm that as of 15 December, less than half-way through the programme year, the number of services in receipt of ECCE Higher Capitation has increased on the year-end total for 2016/2017, to1935.  My officials are confident that this will increase further before year end.  For 2016 / 2017, 2946 individuals were recorded as being ECCE Higher Capitation room leaders.  The figure for 2017/2018 thus far, as at December of 2017, is 2921.  Again, this is expected to increase as the year progresses, and more children enter the ECCE programme in January and April.  </p>  <p>  The ECCE Higher Capitation rate is paid in respect of an experienced practitioner who also holds full, relevant, degree level qualification.  In addition to the completed training, a graduate should have three years paid work experience in the Early Years sector.  This work experience can be accrued at any time during the career of the individual and can be achieved, before, during or after their qualification.  Cumulative work experience should be taken into account, not just one continuous employment period.  DCYA do not ask for proof of this work experience, but trust that employers will assess their staff appropriately.  The employer simply notes the paid work experience of the staff member on the form when applying for ECCE Higher Capitation.  This information, as supplied by the employer, is generally accepted by DCYA. </p>  <p>  The three years&rsquo; work experience on the part of the ECCE Room Leader has been a requirement of ECCE Higher Capitation, on the recommendation of DCYA&rsquo;s own officials, and officials from the Department of Education (DES) Early Years Policy unit, following a review of ECCE Higher Capitation in 2011.  It was not the case, however, that it was always applied as had been intended, and steps were taken from the 2015/2016 programme year onwards to regularise my department&rsquo;s approach in this regard.  Higher Capitation was introduced to incentivise the hiring and retention of graduates, which international research shows can assist with the provision of quality services to children.  As the standard capitation is available to services that meet regulatory requirements, including minimum qualification levels, the fairly significant additional weekly payment offered by the Higher Capitation was intended to focus on both a degree qualification and paid experience deemed important for the delivery of quality services to children. </p>  <p>  Issues such as this are part of a wider conversation around professionalization and award standards for the Early Childhood Care and Education sector in Ireland. Since 2010, there has been a sea-change in the Early Years sector and increased professionalism though training and education has been at the forefront of that.  While DCYA has supported further training and education for the sector, it is admittedly only in 2017 that we were able to provide some support for Early Years graduates through the Learner Fund bursary payment.  Many practitioners have up-skilled to degree level on their own initiative, often studying part-time on top of work and their own personal commitments. </p>  <p>  In the context of the training and education landscape in Early Childhood Care and Education in Ireland which is still growing, developing and standardising, both DCYA and DES continues to believe that additional Exchequer funding to providers via the Higher Capitation should recognise both the degree qualification and important hands-on experience with children.  The historical requirement for three years&rsquo; work experience as part of the eligibility reflects DCYA efforts to incentivise more graduates, and retention of these graduates.</p>  <p>  Our colleagues in DES have initiated a report on the award standard at degree level for Early Childhood Care and Education degrees and are consulting with the sector on this.  The review will include  consideration of the practical experience required as part of the degree.  DCYA is engaged with the process as well, and will take the findings into account in our approaches to the very important issue of further professionalization of the Early Years sector, and our own operational processes. </p>  <p>  DCYA has introduced a number of measures in recent years to support providers of early years care and education services provide financially viable, high quality and accessible services.  These measures include the forthcoming increase to both the standard and higher capitation rates from September 2018.  DCYA is committed to continuing with these endeavours. </p></reply>

All children will be eligible to 76 weeks or 2 academic years of ECCE from September 2018. On Wednesday 6th December I announced that I have paused a decision on the upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur. This means that for the 2018/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of December 6th will bring the parents who planned to apply for this overage exemption from September 2018 some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision. The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities. No child would have lost out as a result of the overage exemption being removed. </p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010. At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two. Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved. This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six. The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland. Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities. If children are not in school by the age of six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school. Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education. Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked, with some success, to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development. The two main enhancements are:- </p>  <p>  - ECCE provision currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018. This is in keeping with good international practice.</p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities. Over 4,000 children have so far benefitted from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.</p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme. This was signalled last year, but in order to give longer notice to parents and providers, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018.

All children will be eligible to 76 weeks or 2 academic years of ECCE from September 2018. On Wednesday 6th December I announced that I have paused a decision on the upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur. This means that for the 2018/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of December 6th will bring the parents who planned to apply for this overage exemption from September 2018 some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision. The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities. No child would have lost out as a result of the overage exemption being removed. </p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010. At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two. Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks. </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved. This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six. The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland. Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities. If children are not in school by the age of six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school. Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education. Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked, with some success, to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development. The two main enhancements are:- </p>  <p>  - ECCE provision currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018. This is in keeping with good international practice.</p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities. Over 4,000 children have so far benefitted from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.</p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme. This was signalled last year, but in order to give longer notice to parents and providers, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018. The motivation underpinning this development is entirely evidence based. Children with a disability benefit from early intervention, high quality early childhood care and education and high quality primary school education.  In this regard my Department is complementing the work of the HSE's role in early intervention and the Department of Educations and Skill's role in high quality primary school education by:- </p>  <p>  - expanding the ECCE programme so that all children have access to a full 76 weeks, double what was available in 2010. </p>  <p>  - providing access to the comprehensive suite of resources under the Access and Inclusion model (AIM), introduced in September 2016. </p>  <p>  The evidence is that children with a disability should start school with their peers once they have access to high quality and inclusive primary school education.

Therefore, the amount of time and intensity of support that is provided to each setting is based on a needs assessment and may vary between settings due to the diversity of needs, size, capacity etc.  On average, a service which is going through the formal QAP requires approximately 120-150 hours of mentoring at a cost of &euro;30 per hour.</p><p>A pilot CPD programme to support practitioners and services to use the Aistear Curriculum Framework and the Aistear-S&iacute;olta online practice guide was run in 2017 by the NCCA and selected S&iacute;olta Aistear mentors.

It will expand further, to 76 weeks / two pre-school years, from September 2018. The two years of ECCE will be available to all children, including those with disabilities. This is in keeping with good international practice.</p>  <p>  The question I understand relates to a recent announcement that I would pause a decision on the overage exemption for ECCE pending consultation.</p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010. At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two. Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved. This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six. The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland. Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities. If children are not in school by six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school. (Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education. Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department. ) </p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development. The two main enhancements are:- </p>  <p>  - The expansion to a full two years for every child from September 2016 as stated above.</p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities. Over 4,000 children have so far benefitted from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.</p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme. On 6th December 2017, I announced that I paused on the removal of the Upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur. This means that for the 2018/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available. </p></reply>

In the last three Budgets (2016, 2017 and 2018) investment in Early Years sector has increased by some 87% which reflect the emphasis being placed on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff. This has helped to address affordability, access and quality, although it is recognised that there is more to be done. The announcement under Budget 2018 to increase ECCE capitation rates by 7% is intended to support the workforce.</p>  <p>  My Department secured &euro;18 million in Programme Support Payments (formerly known as 'non-contact time') for Early Years providers to assist with the administration and programme costs associated with the various childcare schemes. The first payment - some &euro;14.5 million in total - was made available in June 2017 to Early years providers to cover all schemes and represented a payment for an additional 7 days' work. The majority of services have now been paid an average of over &euro;2,000 under this  Programme Support Payment. The second payment - some &euro;3.5 million in total - was made available to all Early Years services who signed up to deliver measures to make childcare more available from September 2017. This funding recognises the time providers need to spend familiarising themselves with the new measures, signing contracts, meeting regulatory and compliance requirements and assisting parents with how they can benefit.  Applications for this payment were made available on the PIP portal up to the end of November, and payments were issued in late December 2017. This brought the overall total 'Programme Support Payments' to &euro;18m in 2017. In Budget 2018 it was announced that &euro;18m in programme support payments will be continued for the coming year. This funding is also intended to support providers and their employees. </p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware of the pressures on the sector with regard to availability of places and sustainability and, following on from significant investment in 2016 and 2017, my Department will provide &euro;6.86m for its capital funding programme under Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  Although my Department has been successful in securing additional funding for this sector over the past three budgets, as outlined above, it is acknowledged that much more must be done if we are truly to have affordable, accessible, quality childcare and continue to improve both the affordability and quality of childcare. To this end I will continue  to engage with my Government colleagues with a view to securing additional investment for the Early Years sector in future budgets. </p>  <p>  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting. I and my Department believe that by working together with all the stakeholders in the early years sector we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and personal development of our children.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring childcare is accessible, affordable and of a high quality.</p></reply>

A copy of the form used for complaints to the Courts regarding barking is available from local authorities. The Court may make an order, requiring the occupier of the premises in which the dog is kept to abate the nuisance by exercising due control over the dog. The Court may also limit the number of dogs that can be kept on a premises or may direct that the dog be delivered to a dog warden to be dealt with as an unwanted dog.</p><p>While complaints in relation to barking dogs are largely dealt with under the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts, the position in relation to noise nuisance generally is that a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise abated if it gives reasonable cause for annoyance.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. </p><p>A public information leaflet, A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment at <i><i></i></i></p><p>A National Protocol for Dealing with Noise Complaints for Local Authorities was recently developed as a cooperative project between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Local Authorities; and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Ireland has an allocation of &euro;250 million under the programme over the period 2014-2020, including both national and EU funding.  The programme is administered by Local Action Groups (LAGs) which deliver funding in accordance with Local Development Strategies that have been agreed for each LAG area. </p><p>Funding Agreements for the current LEADER programme were, for the most part, signed with the LAGs in the second half of 2016 and the programme effectively became operational from that date.  There was no project expenditure on the new LEADER programme prior to 2017, although funding was provided to the LAGs to develop their Local Development Strategies and to prepare for the implementation phase of the programme. </p><p>As of 31st December 2017, 592 projects with a value of over &euro;16.4 million have been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs. The breakdown of these approvals by Local Action Group is provided at Appendix 1.  A further 372 projects requesting over &euro;16.1 million in funding are at various stages in the approval process. This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.</p><p>Project expenditure amounting to &euro;661,844 was incurred in 2017. Details of this expenditure by Local Action Group are also provided at Appendix 1.</p><p>While the pace of approvals varies between Local Action Groups, I am confident that the progress made by the LAGs in the second half of 2017, along with the administrative improvements which my Department introduced last year, will result in a significant increase in project approvals and payments under the LEADER programme over the coming months.</p><p>PQ 1266/18 &ndash; Appendix 1</p><p>LEADER Approvals and Payments as at 31 December 2017<table><tr><th>Local Action Group</th><th>No of Approvals</th><th>Value of Approvals (&euro;)</th><th>Amount Paid (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>11</td><td>810,556.71 </td><td>50,000.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>15</td><td>827,390.54 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>55</td><td>1,048,291.50 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork North </td><td>1</td><td>149,997.94 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork South </td><td>3</td><td>203,610.12 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork West </td><td>3</td><td>139,990.45 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>56</td><td>1,475,272.36 </td><td>30,844.48 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Rural </td><td>15</td><td>222,886.67 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway East </td><td>0</td><td>0.00 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway West </td><td>0</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>103</td><td>1,710,577.99 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>2</td><td>32,970.43 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>30</td><td>794,155.93 </td><td>75,559.16 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>21</td><td>256,624.34 </td><td>12,250.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>4</td><td>103,591.79 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>8</td><td>321,090.50 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>6</td><td>29,025.68 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>19</td><td>220,775.09 </td><td>12,450.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>32</td><td>1,334,192.74 </td><td>57,142.63 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>7</td><td>239,206.66 </td><td>10,770.17 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>18</td><td>999,107.82 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>42</td><td>756,146.13 </td><td>64,050.70 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>9</td><td>242,291.61 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>28</td><td>622,774.68 </td><td>237,707.98 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>36</td><td>835,939.56 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>23</td><td>1,738,098.68 </td><td>111,069.23 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>21</td><td>280,434.93 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>24</td><td>1,017,898.48 </td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>0</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>592 </td><td>16,412,899.33 </td><td>661,844.35 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Ireland has an allocation of &euro;250 million under the programme over the period 2014-2020, including both national and EU funding.  The programme is administered by Local Action Groups (LAGs) which deliver funding in accordance with Local Development Strategies that have been agreed for each LAG area. </p>  <p>  Funding Agreements for the current LEADER programme were, for the most part, signed with the LAGs in the second half of 2016 and the programme effectively became operational from that date. The allocation provided for each sub-regional area is provided for the duration of the Programme rather than on an annual basis.  This affords the LEADER Local Action Groups greater flexibility in managing their resources and ensuring there is no underspend over the full duration of the programme. </p>  <p>  The allocation to the Local Action Group in Donegal is &euro;12.9 million over the lifetime of the programme.</p>  <p>  Expenditure in Donegal in 2016 amounted to &euro;35,362.  This related to the costs of the Local Action Group in administering the programme and engaging with potential applicants following the signing of the Funding Agreement. Expenditure on administration and engagement with potential applicants in 2017 amounted to &euro;747,483, while &euro;30,844 was made in project payments.  However, I expect project payments to increase considerably in 2018.</p>  <p>  As of 31 December, 2017, 56 projects with a value of over &euro;1.4 million had been approved for LEADER funding in Donegal.  A further 16 projects requesting over &euro;1.2 million in funding are at various stages of the approval process. This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.</p>  <p>  The original allocation for the LEADER programme in 2017 was &euro;40 million, as reflected in the Vote for the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Of this &euro;40 million allocation, &euro;17.4 million was transferred within my Department's budget to support a new Local Improvement Scheme to improve non-public roads, while &euro;3.8 million was transferred to increase expenditure on developing Libraries in local communities.</p>  <p>  The transfer of funding from LEADER does not, in any way, reduce the Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide &euro;250 million to LEADER over the duration of the programme. As has been the case under previous LEADER programmes, there is a natural lead-in period in the early years of the programme, followed by a significant ramping up of activity. I fully expect that the &euro;250 million allocation will be fully drawn down over the lifetime of the programme.</p></reply>

Section 47(1) (a) of the Disability Act 2005 requires public bodies to take all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of persons with disabilities. To assist the Department in fulfilling its obligations under the Act a Departmental Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) was appointed in December 2017.  The Department&rsquo;s DLO is a member of the Civil Service Disability Liaison Network, which promotes and disseminates best practice in relation to the employment of people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The role of the DLO will be to ensure that the Department meets its obligations under relevant employment legislation as well as adhering to best practice guidelines in relation to the employment of people with disabilities, including those outlined in the Code of Practice for the Employment of people with Disabilities in the Civil Service (2007). </p>  <p>  The DLO will undertake a survey of staff in Q2 2018, to establish the proportion of staff (and those in the Agencies under our remit) with a disability. </p>  <p>  Once identified, the DLO will take all appropriate measures to assist staff with disabilities, including the provision of training, support and guidance, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  In addition the Department is currently participating in the WAM (Willing Able Mentoring) programme. The WAM programme offers graduates with disabilities work experience and gives practical effect to Government and Civil Service policy on improving the employment prospects for people with disabilities.</p></reply>

LEADER is administered by Local Action Groups (LAGs) which deliver funding in accordance with Local Development Strategies that have been agreed for each LAG area.</p><p>&euro;220 million of the available funding has already been allocated to the 28 LEADER sub-regional areas throughout the country.  The table provided at Appendix 1 provides details of these allocations.  The allocation for each sub-regional area is provided for the duration of the programme rather than on an annual basis.  This provides greater flexibility to the LAGs in managing their resources.</p><p>Each LAG is responsible for deciding how their allocation is distributed to LEADER projects over the duration of the programme, based on the objectives in their Local Development Strategies. The allocation also includes a provision to cover the running costs of the LAGs.</p><p>The balance of &euro;30 million in funding which has not yet been allocated under LEADER is available for schemes which will be selected at a national level based on submissions from the Local Action Groups.  This includes a specific scheme to fund food projects which will be launched in the coming months, and funding to support LAGs that come together to jointly deliver a LEADER project.</p><p>As of 31 December 2017, 592 projects with a value of over &euro;16 million had been approved for LEADER funding by the LAGs and &euro;661,844 in project payments had been made.  A further 372 projects requesting over &euro;16 million in funding are at various stages in the approval process.  This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.</p><p>I anticipate that there will be a significant increase in project expenditure over the course of 2018 based on the progress which has been made by the LAGs in approving projects in recent months.  My Department has also introduced a number of administrative improvements to the LEADER programme which will also assist LAGs and project promoters in their delivery of the programme.</p><p><b>Appendix 1</b></p><p>LEADER 2014-2020 Programme &ndash; Allocations <table><tr><th>County</th><th>Programme Allocation (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>6,416,803.43 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>8,522,285.84 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>8,920,224.65 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>5,091,845.72</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South</td><td>3,831,303.31</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>5,015,674.18</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>12,913,877.86 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>6,370,438.43 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway East</td><td>7,655,850.61 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway West</td><td>4,540,033.00</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>10,219,868.29 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>5,261,600.01 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>7,791,572.91 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>7,124,586.86 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>5,998,474.74 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>9,276,593.96 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>7,597,623.07 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>6,101,862.01 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>11,121,431.88 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>6,903,123.57 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>7,592,719.51 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>8,036,763.90 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>8,852,659.22 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>7,655,647.81 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>10,103,443.28 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>7,522,796.18 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>7,384,206.22 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>9,840,140.56 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>6,336,549.00 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>&euro;220,000,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Action Plan contains a number of measures which have the objective of rejuvenating Ireland&rsquo;s rural towns and villages to make them more attractive places in which to live and work, and to increase their tourism potential.</p>  <p>  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme was launched in 2016 and provided &euro;10 million that year through the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to support 170 projects throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Building on the 2016 scheme, an enhanced Town and Village Renewal Scheme was launched in 2017, with a focus on projects which could stimulate and encourage economic activity in our towns and villages.  Following a competitive process, in October 2017 I announced the allocation of &euro;21.6 million to 281 projects in towns and villages across rural Ireland.  These projects cover many initiatives which will support economic development and employment creation, including through the establishment of enterprise centres and digital hubs.</p>  <p>  I plan to launch another round of the Town and Village Renewal Scheme in 2018, with a continued focus on projects that can make the best impact on supporting local economies and job creation, and improving the quality of life for people who live in rural towns, villages and their surrounding areas.</p></reply>

The latest statistical data available from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (and from Eurostat) are used to analyse trends in official poverty measures and other supporting indicators.  The official Government approved poverty measure used in Ireland is 'consistent poverty'.  This indicator is the overlap of two component indicators, at-risk-of-poverty and basic deprivation.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The plan prioritises 14 high level goals in relation to children, people of working age, older people and communities across Departments and agencies with a remit in social policy.  The overall poverty reduction goal in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion is the National Social Target for Poverty Reduction (NSTPR).  The NSTPR aims to reduce consistent poverty to 2% or less by 2020, from a baseline rate of 6.3% in 2010 with an interim target of to 4% by 2016.</p>  <p>  Two components of the NSTPR are:</p>  <p>  - The Irish contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to reduce by a minimum of 200,000 the population in 'combined poverty' (i.e. consistent poverty, at-risk-of-poverty or basic deprivation) between 2010 and 2020.</p>  <p>  - The child-specific poverty target is to lift over 70,000 children (aged 0-17 years) out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.</p>  <p>  Progress towards the National Social Target for Poverty Reduction, including the sub-target on child poverty and Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is reported annually in the Social Inclusion Monitor.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that these costings include proportionate increases for qualified adults and for those on reduced rates of payment, where relevant.  For the Working Family Payment, the cost is estimated by increasing each income threshold by 1%.</p><p>Using the tax/welfare microsimulation model SWITCH (which was developed by the ESRI and estimates the likely effects of policies on household incomes, families and poverty), there was no significant impact (less than 0.1%) on either the at-risk-of-poverty rate for the population overall or for children specifically.</p><p>There are a number of caveats which should be noted in relation to this finding.  Firstly, the current SWITCH model is based on data from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions, where the income referenced is from January 2015 to December 2016.  In addition, it was not possible to include all of the rate increases in the model, as the number of individuals nationally receiving payments under some schemes (such as Adoptive Benefit and Health &amp;amp; Safety Benefit) is quite small (and care is taken to ensure that the data are aggregated to avoid the indirect identification of respondents).  Furthermore, the Paternity Benefit scheme had not yet been included in the model as this scheme came into effect in September 2016.  In this regard, care must be taken in interpreting this result.</p></reply>

In the case of a late claim, where there is good cause shown for a delay in making the claim, consideration can be given to backdating an award for up to six months.  Further backdating may be considered where the delay in applying for pension was due to incorrect information having been given by the Department or where (medically evidenced) incapacity of the applicant was such that it prevented them from claiming at the due time.  While the specific reason for the delayed application in this case has not been established, a Deciding Officer has to consider the possibility that such delays can be due to means factors that no longer exist or a condition of entitlement that was not possible for the customer to fulfil at the time of an earlier application.</p><p>In this case the Deciding Officer using their discretion, backdated the award of the State pension non-contributory to 7th July 2017 in line with the award date of the person&rsquo;s spouse&rsquo;s claim for State pension non-contributory and they were notified of this decision and their right of appeal.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is a major reform as, for the first time; self-employed people will have access to the safety-net of State income supports, without having to go through a means test, if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability.  Self-employed workers who do not satisfy the medical or social insurance conditionality for invalidity pension may apply for the means tested disability allowance.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since March 2017, self-employed people have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  It is estimated that some 450,000 self-employed contributors including their dependant spouses will be eligible for treatment benefit for the first time as a result of this change.</p>  <p>  Treatment benefit entitlements have also been extended from October 2017 to provide further dental and optical benefits for both the self-employed and employees.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.</p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on the 18 October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state.</p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assumes the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population.</p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular state pension contributory.</p>  <p>  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of state pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The findings of the review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.</p></reply>

The rate bands in place between 2000 and 2012 were more generous than those in place before and after that period, and were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.</p>  <p>  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension were maintained.  Instead of reducing those payments, which many vulnerable pensioners were solely reliant upon, the rates paid to new pensioners who both have additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, for a person with a yearly average of 20 contributions, the new rate of payment introduced in 2012 was still higher than the maximum rate that was in place at the start of 2006.  The rate for such pensioners, while 85% of the maximum rate in place now, is higher, in real terms, than was in place at that time, even after inflation is taken into account.  Given the economic context of what happened in the following years, this has been a significant achievement.</p>  <p>  Also, it should be noted that in most if not all countries, in Europe and beyond, pension reforms have been introduced to make them more sustainable, and these will generally result in people having different payments depending upon when they reach pension age.  The only way to avoid this would be to introduce the reforms for existing pensioners, and decrease the incomes some pensioners have become dependent upon.</p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EU countries.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million extra in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.</p>  <p>  My Department has examined in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the ratebands not been amended in 2012.  A report is being finalised on this matter which I intend to bring to cabinet committee shortly and subsequently to Government for consideration.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State Pension (contributory).  A discussion paper is being drafted by my Department and it is hoped to start the consultation process with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas shortly.  Following the consultation period, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach.</p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

Firstly, a reversal of the amendments made to the OFP scheme could result in a cohort of lone parents that are currently not in receipt of a social welfare payment becoming eligible and therefore moving onto a social welfare payment.  As members of this cohort are not currently in receipt of a social welfare payment it would be difficult to for the Department to estimate the numbers involved.</p>  <p>  Secondly, some customers could seek to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) back to the OFP.  Again, it would be difficult for the Department to estimate the magnitude of this flow between schemes with any degree of accuracy.</p>  <p>  Finally, reversing the changes to the OFP would also increase the incidence of dual payments of OFP and the Working Family Payment (WFP) (formerly FIS).  It would not be possible to estimate the degree to which Working Family Payments might reduce, without having detailed knowledge of individuals&rsquo; working patterns and the degree to which these might change.</p>  <p>  These unknown factors are critical to providing a reliable costing.  The Department is therefore not in a position to provide the costing requested.</p></reply>

The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.</p><p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on the 18<sup>th</sup>October 2017.  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional expenditure if a number of additional benefits, including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p><p>The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.</p><p>The table below shows, the projected cost of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme under the current qualification criteria; the aggregate projected cost under a scenario whereby jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is extended to Class S self-employed contributors from 2018 onward; and the difference between the two which reflects the cost of extending the payment to Class S contributors.  For example, the cost in 2018 as per the table below would be &euro;45 million, rising to &euro;81 million in 2025.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Jobseeker's Benefit Expenditure (&euro; millions)</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total JB expenditure reflecting those currently entitled only</td><td>Total JB expenditure reflecting class S in addition</td><td>Incremental JB expenditure due to extension</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>301</td><td>346</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>282</td><td>340</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>291</td><td>351</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>304</td><td>367</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>318</td><td>385</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>336</td><td>407</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>354</td><td>429</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>375</td><td>455</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>410</td><td>500</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>2035</td><td>453</td><td>556</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>2040</td><td>500</td><td>613</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>2045</td><td>547</td><td>670</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><td>2050</td><td>581</td><td>705</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>2055</td><td>624</td><td>758</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>2060</td><td>671</td><td>815</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>2065</td><td>737</td><td>895</td><td>158</td></tr><tr><td>2070</td><td>820</td><td>1,000</td><td>179</td></tr><tr><td>2071</td><td>840</td><td>1,025</td><td>185</td></tr></table></p><p>The projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assumes the same incidence rate as prevails in the employed (PRSI Class A) population and that the same scheme rules would apply were the scheme extended to the self-employed.</p><p>The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% for all additional benefits, or by 14% in respect of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, under a scenario of no subvention from the Exchequer.</p><p>This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular state pension contributory.</p><p>It is important to note that the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme, which is a means-tested payment, is available to all jobseekers, including employees and those in self-employment.</p></reply>

The Working Family Payment is an in-work support, which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children and offers a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are currently over 57,000 families with nearly 129,939 children in receipt of the WFP.  The estimated spend on WFP this year is approximately &euro;431 million.</p><p>The estimated full year cost in 2018 of increasing the income thresholds of the Working Family payment by &euro;5, &euro;10, &euro;15, &euro;20 and &euro;25 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Increase</th><th>Estimated Full Year Additional Cost </th></tr><tr><td>&euro;5</td><td>&euro;11.7</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;10</td><td>&euro;21.9</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;15</td><td>&euro;31.5</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20</td><td>&euro;43.2</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;25</td><td>&euro;53.6</td></tr></table></p><p>It is worth noting that Budget 2018 increased the income thresholds by &euro;10 for families with up to three children. This change will take effect from 29 March 2018; it is likely that as a result of this increase additional families who are not currently in receipt of the WFP will become eligible for the scheme. The figures above include an estimate of this additional inflow.  Any further changes to the WFP income thresholds would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  We are all aware that people are living for much longer.  Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men and 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by approx. &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (although at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been a number of Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 was likely to be in the region of over &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2018, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 28,854, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  Accordingly, if there were 28,854 such grants made in 2018, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be approx. &euro;24.53 million.</p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department also offers courses in SafeTALK suicide awareness, ASIST suicide prevention and Stress Awareness. These are available to all staff in the Department, including staff in Intreo Centres.  Since 2013, over 2,900 staff have attended training courses in these areas.  In addition, e-learning courses developed for front line public servants by the National Disability Authority (NDA) and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) are freely available online to all staff via the Department&rsquo;s Staff Development intranet site.  Bespoke, ad hoc training can also be procured where required utilising an External Training Budget.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with Mental Health Ireland (MHI) and the Civil Service Employee Assistance Service (CSEAS), Mental Health Awareness workshops have been held in a variety of locations since 2013.  The workshops provided tools and strategies to enhance mental health and well-being, increase awareness and understanding, and promote the range of formal and informal supports and resources available.</p>  <p>  My Department has a dedicated Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) to support our staff with disabilities and their managers. The DLO offers support and promotes awareness of disability issues and services amongst staff, while also facilitating the Department&rsquo;s active participation in the Irish Association for Supported Employment&rsquo;s Job Shadow Initiative and AHEAD's Willing Able Mentoring Programme.  This Officer has attended AsIAm Public Sector Training Programme on Autism-Friendly Practices, NDA Seminar on &ldquo;Alternative &amp;amp; Inclusive Routes to Employment for People with Disabilities&rdquo; and NCBI Seminar on &ldquo;Bridging the Information Gap&rdquo; and has disseminated information from these sources to Departmental staff.  The Department also provides translation, interpretive and Irish Sign Language services as required and is committed to the provision of information in alternative formats where feasible, as outlined in our Customer Charter.</p>  <p>  Induction and Orientation training highlights the range of Departmental supports and grant-aid available for both staff and clients with disabilities.  These include employment supports for jobseekers with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme, EmployAbility Services and the Reasonable Accommodation Fund, in addition to the Civil Service Employee Assistance Service (CSEAS). </p>  <p>  During 2016, in the context of Departmental commitments under Pathways to Work 2016-2020 to extend and intensify proactive engagement with people with a disability, 67 dedicated Case Officers were nominated across the Intreo network.  My Department&rsquo;s Staff Development Unit provided a Disability Awareness Seminar in March 2016 for these Case Officers, with speakers from the National Disability Authority and Epilepsy Ireland.  This was supplemented by tailored instructor-led training nationally in Employment Supports for People with Disabilities and this curriculum is now incorporated as standard into an accredited programme for Case Officers, Level 8 Certificate in Professional Practice in Employability Services, in conjunction with the National College of Ireland (NCI).</p>  <p>  Ongoing liaison, via the Department&rsquo;s Disability &amp;amp; Illness Policy Unit, with the National Disability Authority (NDA) and the Disability Federation of Ireland (DFI) ensures that information on relevant events and seminars is communicated to Departmental staff.  </p>  <p>  The Department will continue with its extensive training and awareness in this area.

Perhaps the most fundamental reform measure which will be contained within this plan will relate to the development of a new auto enrolment supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage.</p>  <p>  Auto enrolment would see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security and independence of future retirees. </p>  <p>  Subject to any Government decision regarding the manner in which this project should be progressed, it is my objective that first members would be enrolled in the new system in 2021.  This project timeframe reflects the scale of such a programme and its importance as being the most fundamental reform of the Irish supplementary pension system in generations. </p>  <p>  Following publication of the reform plan, I intend that the detailed evidence building and consultation required to deliver an automatic enrolment system will be undertaken over an initial project planning phase.  This will include an investigation of the potential organisational models for delivery and identify the likely costs involved.  This information will be used to inform Government in selecting any preferred automatic enrolment operational structure and organisational governance.  Decisions around main design parameters such as target membership, minimum contribution rates, financial incentives etc. will also impact on expenditure requirements.  Correctly positioning/designing each of these parameters will be fundamental to the success of any system.  </p>  <p>  Until this work is complete and a preferred model chosen, it would not be possible to accurately detail the costs of designing and implementing the automatic enrolment system.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by almost 80 private transport operators.  There are approximately 900,000 customers in receipt of free travel. </p>  <p>  Persons resident in Ireland who are over 66 and persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments are eligible for the scheme.  The social welfare payments that allow persons aged under 66 to a free travel pass include disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance and partial capacity benefit.  Disability allowance and invalidity pension are both long term illness payments, and so people in receipt of those payments will already have eligibility.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the eligibility criteria of the free travel scheme to include persons who are not paid a benefit by my department.  </p>  <p>  If the free travel scheme was to be extended to people who are not eligible for a qualifying payment, an assessment process would be required for all such applications, changing the nature of the scheme.  Successive Governments have instead used existing underlying entitlements to confer eligibility for this scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition, any decision to extend the free travel scheme to persons who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s support for An Post is equally apparent.  We have again renewed the contract for cash payment services with the company for another year.  This contract is worth approximately &euro;50m per annum to An Post. </p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides two main options for payment methods for its customers: payments in cash at post offices or payments direct to customer accounts in financial institutions. The Department intends, where possible, to continue to offer its many clients the choice of being paid in cash at the post office or directly into an account in a financial institution. </p>  <p>  Persons under 65 years of age, who are in receipt of a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, are required to be available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work.  In addition, they must comply, when requested to do so, with the Department&rsquo;s activation measures.  Certain compulsory criteria in these measures are relaxed for persons aged 62 and over, for example they are placed on yearly signing and they are given the option of being paid directly into their bank account where this option has not been available for them heretofore.  This has been the Department&rsquo;s policy since 1 January 2014.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, those in receipt of a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment who are fully unemployed are contacted when they reach the age of 62 and offered the option of being paid directly into their bank account or continuing to be paid at the post office.  </p>  <p>  Customer wishes are facilitated where they choose to receive their social welfare payment at their local post office.  It is not proposed to limit the freedom of social welfare customers to be paid directly into a financial institution if they so choose. This is in line with wider Departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that social welfare customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.</p></reply>

The conditions include progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications.  </p>  <p>  The student universal support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  The BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system. </p>  <p>  Applicants holding a qualification at tertiary education level (certificate, diploma, primary degree or post graduate qualification) are not approved under the BTEA to pursue a course at a similar or lower qualification level.  However, the BTEA may be approved if a person holds a HETAC level 8 Honours degree and wishes to pursue a Higher Diploma at HETAC Level 8 as this is considered progression.</p>  <p>  There are a small number of situations where the progression rule is not applied.  For instance, as you reference, where a person only holds a FETAC Level 5 or FETAC Level 6, the progression rule can be waived if their previous qualification was obtained three years prior to re-entry into education and provided the person was in employment for a period of at least three years since commencement of employment.  The course must also be deemed to enhance a person&rsquo;s job prospects and the participant must satisfy all other eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  Additionally, Springboard is an initiative to enable jobseekers to upskill or reskill in areas where there are employment opportunities.  The BTEA can be approved for a person who holds a qualification equivalent to or higher than the qualification for which the BTEA application has been received for Springboard full-time courses.  For example, if a participant already holds a level 8 qualification, they may pursue a level 8 Springboard course.</p>  <p>  Overall, it is important to note that the purpose of the BTEA is to raise educational and skill levels so as to improve a welfare recipient&rsquo;s employment prospects.  Progression in education is an important condition of the support provided.  I have no plans to change these provisions.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarified the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

In 1974, however, the Social Welfare Act made provision that ministers of religion engaged solely on pastoral works for which remuneration was received, could be admitted to social insurance on the application of the appropriate representative body or authority.  This access was subject to an application to (and the agreement of) the then Minister for Social Welfare by an appropriate authority or body acting on behalf of the relevant ministers representing to him or her that the services performed and conditions of appointment were analogous to other occupations which were already covered for social insurance purposes. The provisions of the 1974 Act meant that all religious authorities or bodies had, if they so wished, the opportunity to apply for social insurance access for their employed members and, therefore, did not discriminate in any way against or in favour of any particular congregations.</p>  <p>  Only the Church of Ireland availed of this provision.  The position for other Ministers of Religion, including those employed as teachers or nurses and remunerated as such, were not covered by social insurance.</p>  <p>  In 1986, the Commission on Social Welfare published a range of proposals aimed at developing and enhancing the structure and operation of the social insurance system. </p>  <p>  The exclusion of clergy and other religious denominations from social insurance coverage was examined and in this context, it was not considered appropriate to continue to exclude from the system those who are employed in what might be termed secular employment as employees under a contract of service.  The categories involved were religious who are mainly employed in schools, hospitals and other institutions.  They came within the social protection system as employees, insurable at the ordinary or modified rate, as appropriate to their particular circumstances from 1988.  The effect of this is that clergy and people of other religious denominations who are employed in public or private sector employment &ndash; i.e. in schools, hospitals and other public/social institutions &ndash; are afforded the same level of coverage as other employees in those sectors and generally insurable at PRSI Class A or D, as appropriate.  Those involved in pastoral care only are generally insured as self-employed workers provided they meet the minimum income threshold. </p>  <p>  Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6th April 1988.  These contributions currently  provide cover for self-employed people for benefits such as State pension (contributory), widows/widowers or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, and treatment benefit.  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to cost the backdating of social insurance to the members of religious orders because of various unknown factors, for example, the various contingencies that could have arisen for those members in the intervening period, the question of whether any such backdating should be at the higher or lower rates of payment and the recoupment of contributions for the period in question.</p>  <p>  The PRSI system is based on &ldquo;weeks of insurable employment&rdquo; - in terms of both the calculation of PRSI contributions and the award of social insurance contributions. These contributions are recorded to determine future entitlements to social welfare benefits. This link between contributions awarded and entitlement to benefit is referred to as the contributory principle.  In order to qualify for a social insurance benefit the insured person must have built up an entitlement through the payment of social insurance contributions.  As such, there are no plans to backdate social insurance benefits to those who were excluded from social insurance in the past.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Where a person does not satisfy these conditions they will not be entitled to the fuel allowance.  Unfortunately, the person referred to by the Deputy does not have the required 390 days in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. He had previously been in receipt of Supplementary Welfare Allowance but the period of time spent on that payment does not count towards the 390 day requirement. </p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is a means tested payment to assist householders on long-term social welfare payments to provide for their heating needs.  The payment is not intended to meet those costs in full but rather subsidise a person&rsquo;s fuel costs and only one allowance is paid per household.  </p>  <p>  The jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker's benefit schemes my Department offers other supports including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme which provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p>  <p>  Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment and/or a weekly/monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, including rent, fuel as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENP) and urgent needs payments (UNP).</p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the qualifying conditions for the fuel allowance scheme at present.</p></reply>

The legislation requires that persons must claim their entitlements within a specific period from the date their entitlement arises - this is referred to as the 'prescribed time'.  The prescribed times for each payment are set out in the table.  Once a claim is made within the prescribed time for that particular payment, it is automatically backdated to the date of entitlement. </p><p>Where a claim is made after the prescribed time, a statutory disqualification or disallowance is incurred. However, the legislation gives the deciding officer some discretion to backdate the payment, where the claim is received after the prescribed time, in exceptional circumstances and where the relevant regulations allow. These regulations allow for circumstances where the claimant establishes there was &lsquo;good cause&rsquo; for delay, or that they were inadvertently misinformed by an officer of the Department, or incapacitated and unable to make the claim on time.  </p><p>The table sets out the prescribed times for making a claim for each scheme and the provisions to backdate payments where appropriate.</p><p>Each late claim is assessed by Deciding Officers and is based on the contentions put forward by the applicant and evaluating the available evidence. The deciding officer may decide to backdate the payment, within the limits set out in the table, depending on the circumstances and according to legislative provisions pertaining to each scheme.</p><p>The legislation allows a Deciding Officer the discretion to back date the payment for up to 6 months where he/she is satisfied that the claimant had &lsquo;good cause&rsquo; for failing to apply within the prescribed time, provided of course that the claimant was eligible during the 6 months. This limitation does not apply in the case of Child Benefit.</p><p>Backdating of a late claim beyond 6 months can be considered only in specific circumstances whereby the failure to claim arose as the result of either incorrect information being supplied by the Department or the claimant&rsquo;s incapacity due to illness or infirmity.</p><p>Where the failure to claim within the prescribed time arose as a result of erroneous information supplied by staff of the Department, the claim may be backdated to the date of commencement of entitlement<font color="#FF0000">.</font></p><p>All decisions with regard to entitlement under these provisions are made by deciding officers, and can therefore be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO). </p><p>The Department has published information on Claims and Late Claims on www.welfare.ie.</p><p><b>Table: Prescribed time for making a claim and possible period(s) for backdating payments in specified conditions, for each scheme</b><table><tr><th>Type of claim</th><th>Prescribed time for making a claim</th><th>Max possible period of backdate</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>First date of entitlement</td><td>Backdate max. 6 months</td></tr><tr><td>Back to Work Family Dividend</td><td>Within 3 months of first date of entitlement</td><td>Backdate max. 6 months</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant </td><td>Within 3 months of death of deceased</td><td>Backdate max. 6 months</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension </td><td>First date of entitlement</td><td>Backdate max. 6 months</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance</td><td>First date of entitlement</td><td>Backdate max. 6 months</td></tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit</td><td>8 weeks before &amp;amp;

The numbers referred initially were low but this has increased with almost 141,000 Jobseekers having commenced with the service by the end of December 2017.</p><p>For the purposes of the JobPath service all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years, 3 years plus etc.).</p><p>The duration of a person's Jobseeker's Allowance claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment.  Jobseeker Allowance claims are made up of continuous periods of unemployment.  Any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks is considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment - this is known as linking the claims.  Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment for less than a year are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within that period: as a result, Jobseekers retain certain entitlements (for example, no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and are available for selection for support through the departments activation services.</p><p>The table shows the age and length of unemployment of the circa 141,000 jobseekers who have engaged with the service as of the end of December 2017, of these in excess of 52% were over 3 years unemployed.<table><tr><th></th><th></th><th colspan="5"><div>Client age at Referral</div></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Duration on LR</td><td>18-25</td><td>26-35</td><td>36-45</td><td>46-55</td><td>55+</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1-2 Years on LR</td><td>298</td><td>531</td><td>436</td><td>312</td><td>134</td><td>1711</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2-3 Years on LR</td><td>130</td><td>365</td><td>336</td><td>294</td><td>129</td><td>1254</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&amp;gt; 3 Years on LR</td><td>200</td><td>1006</td><td>958</td><td>969</td><td>490</td><td>3623</td></tr><tr><td>2015 Total</td><td></td><td>628</td><td>1902</td><td>1730</td><td>1575</td><td>753</td><td>6588</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Passing 12 Months on LR</td><td>466</td><td>562</td><td>445</td><td>306</td><td>124</td><td>1903</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1-2 Years on LR</td><td>3112</td><td>4290</td><td>3515</td><td>2841</td><td>1201</td><td>14959</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2-3 Years on LR</td><td>1529</td><td>2497</td><td>2160</td><td>1978</td><td>889</td><td>9053</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&amp;gt; 3 Years on LR</td><td>2774</td><td>10395</td><td>10139</td><td>9734</td><td>5249</td><td>38291</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>Working Part Time on LR (&amp;gt;1 year)</td><td>21</td><td>235</td><td>295</td><td>271</td><td>162</td><td>984</td></tr><tr><td>2016 Total</td><td></td><td>7902</td><td>17979</td><td>16554</td><td>15130</td><td>7625</td><td>65190</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Passing 12 Months on LR</td><td>412</td><td>397</td><td>290</td><td>228</td><td>96</td><td>1423</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1-2 Years on LR</td><td>4315</td><td>4434</td><td>3499</td><td>2576</td><td>961</td><td>15785</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2-3 Years on LR</td><td>1683</td><td>1986</td><td>1613</td><td>1234</td><td>469</td><td>6985</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&amp;gt; 3 Years on LR</td><td>3254</td><td>9711</td><td>8187</td><td>7554</td><td>3321</td><td>32027</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>Working Part Time on LR (&amp;gt;1 year)</td><td>628</td><td>3467</td><td>3691</td><td>3475</td><td>1612</td><td>12873</td></tr><tr><td>2017 Total</td><td></td><td>10292</td><td>19995</td><td>17280</td><td>15067</td><td>6459</td><td>69093</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td></td><td>18822</td><td>39876</td><td>35564</td><td>31772</td><td>14837</td><td>140871 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The objective of this programme is to encourage private sector employers to employ people with disabilities and so increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market. This is achieved by compensating employers through grant assistance where a person&rsquo;s disability restricts their productivity to 80% or less when compared to their peers.</p><p>The participation of potential employees on the scheme is contingent on a person having a disability and who has the capacity to work from 21 hours to 39 hours per week. For those individuals who are already in employment, the WSS may only be considered where the individual is less than 12 months in that employment. When the employee is over 12 months in the job and where a productivity shortfall on their part is putting that particular employment in jeopardy, the employee retention grant scheme (ERGS) should be applied for.</p><p>The purpose of the ERGS is to assist employers to retain employees who acquire an illness, condition or impairment which impacts on their ability to carry out their job. The scheme is structured in two stages, comprising the development and implementation of a retention strategy. The total amount available under this grant scheme is &euro;15,000 per applicant. </p><p>The ERGS is one of the grants provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection under the reasonable accommodation fund. This fund assists private sector employers to take appropriate measures to enable a person with a disability/impairment to have access to employment. The scheme&rsquo;s other grants include: </p><p>- Workplace Equipment/Adaptation Grant</p><p>- Personal Reader Grant</p><p>- Job Interview Interpreter Grant </p><p>Further information on the range of employment supports for people with disabilities, including application forms, can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website:  </p><p>If the Deputy can provide details directly to the Department on the individual referred to a more tailored response can be provided.  </p></reply>

Both schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.</p>  <p>  At present an individual can earn a little over &euro;19,760 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;33,975 if they are both working.  Where a person&rsquo;s part time employment ceases they can apply for jobseekers allowance which is a means tested payment or if they have the required number of contributions they may have an entitlement to jobseekers benefit.</p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment. My officials have recently completed this report on these issues which I will consider in detail.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently collating data in relation to those who qualify for Jobseekers Benefit and who are in subsidiary employment. We will have 12 months of data gathered by May 2018 at which point I will be in a better position to make an informed decision on this issue. </p></reply>

The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full and only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  Participants on the Rural Social Scheme (RSS) can be paid the fuel allowance where they applied for, and were awarded, the fuel allowance prior to commencing on the scheme and where they satisfy or continue to satisfy the conditions.  Entitlement to the fuel allowance cannot be established after a person commences on the RSS.  Not all participants on the RSS have an entitlement to the fuel allowance as they may not satisfy the fuel scheme conditions. </p>  <p>  Where an RSS participant has an underlying entitlement to the fuel allowance - but is not in receipt of the allowance because another member of the household is receiving it - and if there is a change in circumstances e.g. the fuel allowance recipient is no longer residing at the address, then it is open to the RSS participant to apply for the fuel allowance. In these circumstances, the fuel entitlement can be reviewed and awarded provided the participant satisfies all conditions for receipt of fuel allowance. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Credits may also enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the level of payment of State pension contributory (SPC), but only where the individual has already met the condition relating to the minimum number of paid contributions.</p>  <p>  To qualify for credits an individual must satisfy entitlement to the credits scheme. While there are no self-employed credits, individuals who were previously employed can access the scheme in the same manner as other workers, subject to meeting the conditions of the scheme.  In general credits can only be awarded where an individual has had a recent attachment to the workforce as an employee i.e. within the last 2 years.  Therefore credits are not automatically awarded to all recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  </p>  <p>  Individuals who are caring on a full-time basis, including those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance may, however, qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme. The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers to protect their SPC entitlement, and applies to homemaking periods since 6 April 1994.  It applies to the self-employed on the same basis as it does to other workers.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person age 12 or over will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of determining the rate of their entitlement to SPC. In this way the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme ensures that an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to SPC is protected during periods spent caring.  </p></reply>

Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area. </p><p>The general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase. </p><p>The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p><p>It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase or decrease the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities but rather to ensure that the valuations used for rating purposes are up-to-date and reflect current market conditions.  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended by section 8 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, provides that I, as Minister, can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation.  Rate Limitation Orders were made for the 2014 financial year in respect of the revaluation of Waterford local authorities.</p><p>Rates income data are published by local authorities in their Annual Financial Statements, which are published as a matter of course on local authority websites.

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.</p><p>A residential property that was not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge. This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and have been living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons, for example, and, in such a case, the property that the owner was no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it was the only residential property that person owned. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.</p><p>The self-assessed Charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the charge, in addition to him or her being liable to pay the Charge, is liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid.</p><p>Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 also deals with the collection of un-discharged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge. The Act provided for a period from 2 March 2014 to 31 August 2014 during which time no new late penalties were applied to existing liabilities. If payment was not made in full or if settlement terms were not agreed by the end of that period, an additional late payment fee of &euro;120 per liability date applied on 1 September 2014. As the Charge applied in each of the years from 2009 to 2013, there were five liability dates &ndash; 31 July 2009 and 31 March for each of the years 2010 to 2013.  In addition to this late payment fee to be applied per liability date, the entire NPPR liability is then increased by a factor of 50% and frozen.</p><p>Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>A number of exemptions from the charge are set out in section 4 of the 2009 Act and section 4(6) provides for an exemption from the charge in a situation where a residential property is occupied rent-free as the sole or main residence of a relative of the owner and the sole or main residence of the owner is either on the same property or within two kilometres of it.</p><p>The NPPR Project Board, in conjunction with individual local authorities, undertook a media campaign in 2014 aimed at reminding non-compliant owners that additional late payment penalties applied after 31 August 2014. The extensive radio and print media campaign reminded non-compliant owners of their obligations to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off grace period. While it is a necessary principle of law that all citizens are required to be aware of relevant legal obligations and duties in respect of such charges, as is the case in other jurisdictions, it remains my view that reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that property owners have been aware of the Charge and liability dates.</p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases. It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.  All non-compliant owners or owners with queries should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments.</p></reply>

Such initiatives include: </p><p>- planning reforms to provide flexibility and certainty in delivering viable housing schemes and apartment developments in the right locations, </p><p>- funding of &euro;226 million to open up housing lands through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), to deliver new homes that are more viable and more affordable than would otherwise be the case, including funding of over &euro;4.5 million for two strategic projects in Newtown, Drogheda and Mount Avenue, Dundalk that collectively can deliver over 400 homes by 2021, and</p><p>- the introduction of Rent Pressures Zones to moderate the rise in rents in the parts of the country where rents are highest and rising. Drogheda was designated a Rent Pressure Zone in September 2017.</p><p>Other significant measures to promote the building of more homes, more quickly, and at more affordable prices, were also introduced in Budget 2018 through:</p><p>- Investing more in direct house-building by the State, with investment of &euro;6 billion committed, to increase the overall delivery to 50,000 new social homes by 2021;</p><p>- Removing the Capital Gains Tax incentive to hold on to residential land;</p><p>- Escalating penalties for land hoarding; </p><p>- Providing a new, more affordable finance vehicle for builders through House Building Finance Ireland (HBFI);</p><p>- Changes to planning guidelines in relation to apartment development.</p><p>While these actions are having an impact and will have a greater impact in time, I consider that a further package of targeted measures focussed on addressing affordability is needed to enable low- to moderate-income households, that do not qualify for social housing supports, to purchase or rent homes, particularly in Dublin and other major urban areas.  This will include, but will not be limited to, the deployment of &euro;25 million Exchequer funding, over 2018 and 2019, to unlock local authority-owned lands specifically for affordable housing and further measures in relation to improving the viability of apartment development. I expect to make an announcement with regard to this further package of affordability measures in the very near future.</p></reply>

Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation.  If the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office.

It provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a Rent Pressure Zone. Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to 2016:</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,056 per month).</p><p>On 20 December 2017, the RTB published the Rent Index Report in relation to Quarter 3 2017, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country. This allows all interested parties to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  The data from the Rent Index Report relating to Dundalk are detailed in the following table:<table><tr><th>Local Electoral   Area</th><th>Quarters &amp;gt; 7%</th><th>Average 2017 Q3 (&euro;)  </th></tr><tr><td>Dundalk Carlingford  </td><td>5</td><td>723.91</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk South </td><td>5</td><td>881.17</td></tr></table></p><p>While in 5 of the last 6 quarters rent inflation in Dundalk has been 7% or greater, the average monthly rent in the local electoral area of Dundalk Carlingford is &euro;723.91 and in Dundalk South is &euro;881.17, which are both below the average national standardised rent of &euro;1,056 per month. Therefore, the Local Electoral Areas in Dundalk do not meet the criteria for designation at this time. </p><p>Under the Act, I have no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as Rent Pressure Zones or in deciding whether they should be designated. The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence.</p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

Irish Water is also responsible for water services infrastructure including water supply pipes or drainage pipes extending from a waterworks or wastewater works to the curtilage of a private property.</p><p>Under sections 43 and 54 of the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for maintenance and replacement of any water or wastewater pipes, connections or distribution systems that are located within the boundary of a private property rests with the owner. This was the position that pertained prior to the establishment of Irish Water, when individual local authorities held responsibility for public water services and infrastructure. </p><p>In line with broader water conservation policy objectives, Irish Water developed proposals for a First Fix Leak Repair scheme  and these proposals were approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities or CRU (formerly known as the Commission for Energy Regulation) on 5 August 2015.  The relevant policy document, Irish Water First Fix Leak Repair Scheme for Domestic Water Customers, was subsequently published by Irish Water and is available at the following weblink - <i>.</i></p><p>I understand that to date the First Fix scheme has resulted in repairs capable of delivering savings equivalent to a combined total of 86 million litres of water a day.  Under the scheme, Irish Water is assisting customers by notifying them when suspected leakage is occurring within the boundary of their property. I understand that utilising meter read data to identify the most significant leaks has proven to be key to efficient operation of the scheme.  The &ldquo;continuous flow alarms&rdquo; generated by the water meters are the trigger to identify and initiate the First Fix repair scheme process and this allows the more significant leaks to be prioritised.</p><p>Conservation of water supplies in general continues to be a policy priority. The Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (April 2017) recommended that the First Fix scheme remain in place and that further options or schemes be explored in order to address the issue of leaks within the boundaries of the users' property.  In this regard, I understand that Irish Water will be engaging with the CRU early in 2018 to assess how the benefits of the First Fix scheme may be applied to leaks on the customer side of unmetered properties.</p></reply>

The legal documents giving effect to the licence were finalised in 2014 by the then Minister. This licence allows for the harvest of specific seaweeds in specific areas of Bantry Bay by mechanical means. In accordance with the conditions attaching to the licence in 2011, prior to the commencement of works, the licensee was required to submit a detailed monitoring plan for approval by my Department. The plan and associated baseline report were approved on 30th November last after taking into account the expert views of members of the Marine Licence Vetting Committee. Further detail of the monitoring plan and report can be found on my Department's website at . The company is now free to commence harvesting under the terms of the licence finalised in 2014.</p><p>With regard to the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (EIA), the EIA Directive applies to a wide range of public and private projects. It is a mandatory requirement for project types listed in Annex I of the Directive, e.g. the construction of motorways and airports or the construction of installations for the disposal of hazardous waste.  For project types listed in Annex II, it is up to the consenting authority to determine if an EIS is required by carrying out EIA screening based on criteria set out in the Directive.  Examples of Annex II projects include intensive fish farming, reclamation of land from the sea, extractive mining, fossil fuel storage or metal processing.  An EIA may also be required where the thresholds set out in the Directive are not met (sub-threshold EIA) or where the project or activity is proposed to be carried out in a Natura 2000 site.  </p><p>If the consenting authority determines that the EIA Directive applies to a project it requires that an applicant must prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), following which the consent authority would carry out EIA. In the case referred to, the proposed project is not within a Natura 2000 site, it is not of a class set out in Annex I of the Directive nor does it fall into Annex II; therefore, an EIS was not required. I should, however, point out that the Marine Licence Vetting Committee considered all material pertaining to the application and concluded that subject to compliance with specific conditions, the proposed harvesting was not likely to have a significant negative impact on the marine environment. In the case of this licence those conditions included a detailed monitoring report and an associated baseline study. </p><p>Representatives of the named group met with officials on 28th November 2017. They have requested a further meeting and I have agreed to meet with a delegation.</p></reply>

For example, the funding drawn down by a local authority over the course of a construction project is directly in line with the progress in the construction activity. For a housing acquisition, a local authority draws down funding when it has acquired the property.</p><p>My Department now publishes a quarterly Social Housing Construction Status Report, which lists all such projects that are on site, are undergoing planning and design, or have been completed since the commencement of Rebuilding Ireland.

The substitute consent procedure is set out in Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) and related provisions specifically for quarries are set out in section 261A of that Act.  These provisions were inserted into the 2000 Act, following a 2008 Judgment of the European Court of Justice, which found that, generally speaking, provisions of the 2000 Act permitting applications for planning permission to retain existing developments requiring environmental impact assessment (EIA) or appropriate assessment (AA) were contrary to EU law.   </p>  <p>  The substitute consent process involves the preparation of a remedial environmental impact statement or a remedial Natura impact statement, or both as appropriate, stating the significant effects of the development on the environment or the European site concerned, the remedial or mitigation measures taken or proposed to be taken in relation to those effects and a timescale for the taking of such proposed measures.  </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of these provisions, the Board has received a total of 141 substitute consent applications of which 131 have been determined, leaving a total of 10 such cases on hand at the end of 2017.  Nine of these cases relate to quarry developments and one relates to temporary holiday accommodation.  The fact that 8 cases on hands have been extended beyond the statutory objective period for a decision is indicative of the generally complex nature of these applications, involving EIA or AA, or both, and often complex site-specific circumstances.  In certain cases, this has resulted in the Board seeking further information from applicants and engaging in correspondence with relevant participants in the cases.  </p>  <p>  The Board is now focused on making a determination on the remaining substitute consent cases as soon as possible and I am satisfied that it has sufficient resources in this regard.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;115.7 million has been provided from 2013 to the end of 2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000  local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020. Details of the funding provided and the number of units upgraded by local authority under the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme since 2013 are provided in the attached table.</p><p>The Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme is being implemented in a number of phases: Phase 1 commenced in 2013 and is focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties while Phase 2 of the Programme, which has been piloted in both Fingal and Westmeath County Councils, will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction. Funding may also be provided under Phase 2 to upgrade poorly performing windows and doors in specific circumstances. </p><p>The Voids Programme introduced by my Department in 2014, also provides funding for energy efficiency works to local authority housing.  During the period 2014 to 2017, works were carried out on 7,160 units under this Programme supported by funding of &euro;29.8m from my Department. This funding is in addition to the specific Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme information outlined in the attached table.</p><p>In 2018, funding of &euro;35 million is available for energy efficiency works under both programmes. The main focus of the available funding for the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme will be on the completion of the remaining Phase 1 works and formally rolling out Phase 2. My Department will, shortly, be asking local authorities including Mayo County Council to submit details of their work proposals and related funding requirements for this Programme in 2018. Funding allocations will be determined following assessment of the local authority returns.</p><p><b>PQ 54793/17 : Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme &ndash;Units &amp;amp; Funding 2013 -

A key principle of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice. This is distinct from RAS, which is a different type of social housing support, where the tenant may not always find their own accommodation and instead are allocated a dwelling in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Unlike HAP, where a RAS tenancy is ending, the local authority retains the responsibility to source further accommodation for that household.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, which provides for HAP, a household in receipt of another form of social housing support, such as accommodation provided under the RAS, will not be generally eligible for HAP. Section 45 (5) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 does allow for the provision of HAP where a household is currently residing in another form of social housing support, except in emergency circumstances. The ending of a RAS tenancy does not fall within the meaning of an emergency as prescribed by that section of the legislation. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. In order to provide greater equity of options between social housing tenants, and in light of the current private rental market, my Department is currently exploring how greater flexibility of movement between allocated social housing supports and HAP could be facilitated. This may require legislative change. In general, I am satisfied with the operation of HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

This recommendation was accepted by Eurostat, with a proviso that the decision could be reviewed at a future date. </p>  <p>  In December the CSO made a decision that 14 of the 16 largest AHBs examined (i.e. those with 300+ homes in their property portfolios) in the initial phase of the review should be re-classified as falling within the public sector, under the broad local government classification. This decision has been sent to Eurostat for their consideration and ultimate determination.</p>  <p>  While a final decision has yet to be taken by Eurostat regarding the classification of AHB expenditure, detailed analysis of the potential impacts on the government debt and expenditure will be completed by the relevant Departments and Agencies. To inform these considerations, the CSO is currently engaged in collecting the required data to compile the end-March 2018 Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) notification tables (also known as the Maastricht returns), covering general government deficit and debt. At the same time, the Department of Finance is also preparing the Stability Programme Update 2018. This will take full account of the figures published by the CSO as part of the government finance statistics release.</p>  <p>  My Department will be examining the provisional assessment by the CSO in detail, including the rationale for their recommendation, in close collaboration with my colleague Minister Donohoe&rsquo;s Departments and the AHB sector itself, to assess the historic and future implications as well as identifying what measures can be taken to manage or mitigate the potential impacts on the capacity of the AHB sector in the supply and management of social housing.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this assessment by the CSO, the Government still sees an important role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland, and we intend to press ahead with our ambitious plans to use all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain our planned momentum towards meeting the 50,000 Rebuilding Ireland social housing target.</p></reply>

The maximum funding provided for each unit under this programme is &euro;30,000.  In addition, the Derelicts Programme provides funding to remediate more seriously derelict social houses.  There is also another smaller 2 into 1 programme, which focuses on converting vacant old bedsit type of accommodation into one bedroom units.  </p><p>Vacant social houses, which are categorised as voids, need far greater repairs that normal re-letting works to bring them to a suitable letting condition.  They are vacant pending this work.  The key objectives of the programme are to minimise the turnaround and re-let time of vacant units and return them to use in an energy efficient condition.  </p><p>Retrofitting is undertaken on properties selected by local authorities on the basis of unit cost, the extent of local housing need and the age/condition of the property.  The programme focuses on retrofitting of the fabric of the dwelling (insulation of walls/roofs, window/door replacement, heating system improvement etc.). During the period, 7,160  units had energy efficiency works recouped [1,850, 2,114, 1,770 and 1,426 for 2014 to 2017, respectively]. The remainder may have had works carried out previously under a separate Energy Efficiency programme.</p><p>Circulars issued to each local authority outlining the scheme and the information required for those authorities seeking to apply for funding under the scheme. No distinction is made between the length of time a property is vacant before being eligible for funding under the programmes and my Department does not collect data on the average period that a unit was vacant prior to their refurbishment. The scale of the pre-letting works required is a more relevant factor.</p><p>Given that amalgamated data across the 3 programmes is provided under Rebuilding Ireland, for consistency purposes, the combined voids data is presented below.</p><p>Voids Data 2014 to 2017: incorporating Voids, Derelicts and 2 into 1 Programmes<table><tr><th></th><th>Units Returned in 2014</th><th>Funding

In addition, to ensure broader consultation and engagement with delivery agents and stakeholders on implementation progress and emerging issues, an Oversight Group and a Project Board are in operation. </p><p>Following my recent review of Rebuilding Ireland, I announced that Minister of State Damien English will lead a new delivery team in my Department working with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) on social housing delivery.  I am confident that this will further add to the impetus already in place for the delivery of much needed social housing homes, across the country, by local authorities and AHBs.  </p><p>This governance is additional to the ongoing contact my Department has with local authorities and AHBs around all forms of housing delivery, including regular technical meetings to review progress in respect of social housing projects.</p></reply>

The RTB offers callers the choice of calling a lo-call helpline number from landlines and a local number which may be cheaper or free to call as part of some mobile providers' packages. </p><p>Further information is available at www.rtb.ie/tenants and the RTB helpline - Lo-call on 0818 30 30 37 (mobile operators might charge a premium rate to the Lo-call number) or 01 702 8100 - available from Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 6.30pm. </p><p>Threshold, the national housing charity, operates the Tenancy Protection Service (TPS) which is a national service providing advice and support to households living in private rented accommodation who are experiencing tenancy problems, including where a tenancy is at risk of termination. The TPS seeks to protect existing tenancies, keeping tenants in their homes and preventing them from having to access homeless services. For example, the TPS can apply for an enhanced rent supplement payment above existing rent caps, if a tenant is in receipt of rent supplement and is at risk of homelessness due to a rent increase. </p><p>The TPS helpline on free-phone 1800 454 454 is available from Monday to Friday, 9am to 9pm.

This information is available on the Agency's website at the following link:</p><p><i> .</i></p><p>Following a Review of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme, published on 8 February 2017, a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme came into effect to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  The Review, available at the following link: <i>,</i>explored the impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.</p><p>My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  I am providing an additional &euro;5m for the MTR scheme this year, which will support at least 250 additional MTR cases to be completed by AHBs working together with lenders using the existing MTR scheme.</p><p>The MTR Review also concluded that the current financial model of the MTR scheme may not, in its current configuration, be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency has been working with a number of financial entities who have expressed an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of alternative long-term lease arrangements.  In advance of these pilots and to establish the operability of an alternative financing approach, a targeted market testing exercise has been undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a MTR cohort, taking account of the necessity to provide a long-term stable solution for eligible households.</p><p>The responses to the market testing exercise have been reviewed by the Housing Agency and my Department.  A call for Expressions of Interest from bodies interested in pursuing pilot operating models was initiated by the Housing Agency on 26 October 2017. Once the Expressions of Interest process is concluded - the extended deadline for receipt of submissions is 31 January 2018 -  the Housing Agency will make recommendations to my Department as to the make-up of the pilot scheme, which can then be initiated.</p><p>Following the completion of the pilot scheme and depending on its success and the availability of funding, a wider MTR scheme modelled on the alternatively funded pilot scheme, may be considered.</p></reply>

The review involved discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the group water sector.  The discussions, which included an examination of expenditure data on schemes, concluded in December when I approved the revised subsidy levels.  The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services. </p>  <p>  The revised subsidy levels are as follows:</p>  <p>  1.  For the annual subsidy towards the operation and maintenance costs of group water schemes providing a supply of water for domestic purposes (knows as &lsquo;Subsidy A&rsquo;): </p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house in private group water schemes has increased from &euro;140 per household to &euro;231. An increased maximum subsidy of &euro;281 per household is available for small schemes of less than 100 houses that are willing, in the interests of providing in the long-term a more sustainable water supply to their members, to progress towards rationalisation or amalgamation with other schemes.</p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house for public group water schemes has increased from &euro;70 per household to &euro;115.  These are schemes that supply their members with water that is provided by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  The portion of costs than can be recouped by group water schemes has also increased.  Typically up to 60% of costs have been covered by the subsidy payments.  This has increased to 85%.  There are also changes and simplifications to how these costs are assessed.</p>  <p>  2.  For the additional subsidy that is paid towards the costs of group water schemes that have long-term Operation and Maintenance Contracts (for example, as part of a Design Build Operate project) for the delivery of water (known as &lsquo;Subsidy B)&rsquo;: </p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the level of volumetric costs incurred by group water schemes operating under these contracts that is recoupable, from 60% to 85%.  This will allow for a greater portion of costs to be included within the subsidy payment.</p></reply>

The programme provides for the funding of demonstration Group Sewerage Schemes, through Measure 4(d), where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective.</p>  <p>  Local authorities were invited in January 2016 to submit bids under the programme.  The invitation envisaged no more than two demonstration group sewerage projects being brought forward under the measure in any one year of the three year programme.  The demonstrations will allow my Department, over the course of the programme, to determine the appropriate enduring funding levels and relationship with the current grant scheme.</p>  <p>  As new demonstration group sewerage schemes have been identified for the duration of the programme, and as only two demonstration projects can be advanced in any given year, my Department does not propose to modify the current programme at this point. </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the challenges which remain in relation to rural water services.  Consequently I announced last December that my Department will initiate a short, focused review of the wider investment needs relating to rural water services.  This review will feed into the consideration of the multi-annual programme from 2019 and any new measures will be reflected in the finalised River Basin Management Plan to be published early this year.  </p></reply>

The Government decided that 80% of the estimated LPT liability in each local authority area for a given year is retained in that area to fund public services, notwithstanding any local variation decisions.  The remaining 20% of LPT is re-distributed to provide equalisation funding to those local authorities that have lower property tax bases, due to the variance in property values and density across the State.  This reflects the fact that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources.</p>  <p>  In accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of LPT, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it, known as the baseline.  There are variances across the country in terms of LPT levels but it is important that all local authorities receive at least this baseline level of funding to ensure they can deliver services.  Equalisation is the process that ensures that every local authority&rsquo;s LPT allocation is brought up to this baseline and there is a finite level of funding available for this purpose.  For 2018, the overall equalisation requirement is &euro;139m. &euro;97m of this is from the 20% contribution from all local authorities, with the Exchequer providing the remaining &euro;42m.</p>  <p>  The role of local authorities in deciding the annual local adjustment factor is an important part of LPT funding and a key connection between revenue raising and expenditure decisions at local level.  Every local authority must decide whether or not to increase or decrease LPT rates by up to 15% each year.  Galway County Council varied the basic rate of LPT upwards by 10% for 2017.  Accordingly, the total 2017 LPT allocation paid to Galway County Council in 2017 was &euro;15.97m, which includes the extra &euro;1.45m raised by the 10% increase.  For 2018, no variation has been applied by Galway County Council, meaning it will receive an LPT allocation of &euro;14.52m.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current overall funding model enables local authorities to support an appropriate level of service provision across the State. </p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  It was for reasons of ensuring the sustainability of the scheme, that the minimum income was introduced.  This was in order to demonstrate an applicant had an income of a long-term and sustainable nature, to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The operation of the first year of the scheme has been the subject of a review and I expect to publish the outcome of that review shortly. </p></reply>

In the context of these discussions within the Working Party on General Affairs, one Member State circulated a proposal in December last to allow a number of seats in future elections to the European Parliament to be allocated to transnational lists (i.e. a European Union-wide constituency).  It is understood that this proposal will be considered by the Working Party in due course.</p><p>Separately, national constituencies for European Parliament elections were most recently reported on in the Constituency Commission Report 2017 (June 2017), where no change to the existing arrangements for European Parliament constituencies was recommended.  At the time of that reportthere was no change to the number of members to be elected in Ireland.  However, in light of population change in MemberStates and having regard to the proposed withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, there may be a need to adjust the distribution of seats in advance of the next elections to the European Parliament in 2019.  This work is being undertaken on the initiative of the European Parliament.</p><p>In this context, the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in early September 2017, published a draft report on the composition of the European Parliament for 2019-2024.  It is anticipated that the European Parliament will vote in plenary on this matter later this year after which a proposal will be brought to Council.</p><p>In the event that Ireland&rsquo;s total number of seats in the European Parliament is changed in respect of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term, it will be necessary to review and revise our European constituency arrangements.  Section 5(1A) of the <i>Electoral Act 1997 </i>makes provision for the establishment of a committee to make a report in relation to European Parliament constituencies.  This was done in 2013 prior to the last elections to the European Parliament.</p></reply>

All projects were allowed to go to design phase in advance of signing grant agreements.</p>  <p>  Funding for LIHAF is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and will be available for local authorities to drawdown over the lifetime of the projects.  Preliminary approvals were announced last March and due to the need for necessary preparatory work such as design, planning and public procurement the projects incurred very small expenditure levels in 2017.  The total expenditure on LIHAF for 2017 was &euro;1.67 million.  It is expected that construction will commence on many projects in 2018 and a substantially accelerated drawdown is likely this year.</p>  <p>  Through proactive management of the broader housing programme, the underspend in 2017 was applied to other housing activities, ensuring that the funding available in 2017 was fully applied to housing priorities.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2018, I announced an additional &euro;50 million funding which will be available for a second LIHAF call and which will again be subject to matching funding of 25% by local authorities.  This capital funding will facilitate the provision of more public infrastructure to unlock further sites and activate more housing supply.  I intend issuing a further call for proposals under LIHAF early this year and it will be open to all local authorities to submit new projects or resubmit previous unsuccessful projects for consideration at that time.</p></reply>

A commitment to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes through a range of delivery mechanisms is being supported by a multi-annual Exchequer commitment totalling &euro;6.5 billion over the period of the plan.

The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates. However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.  The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas.  Separate legislation governed refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds applied but only 50% of the rates paid were refundable.</p>  <p>  With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area.  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above). Guidance has been provided to local authorities and elected members in that regard.</p>  <p>  My Department has collated information regarding the decisions by local authorities in relation to refund rates from 2015 to 2017. For 2015, four local authorities chose to amend their refund rate.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council reduced its rate from 100% to 75%.  Galway City and Louth County Councils reduced their rates from 100% to 50%.  Limerick City and County adopted a refund rate of 25%.  All other local authorities chose to retain the existing 2014 refund rate for 2015.  This included Dublin City and Cork City which both retained the pre-existing 50% refund rates in their local authority areas.</p>  <p>  For 2016, all local authorities continued with the same refund rate adopted in 2015, except Waterford City and County Council, which reduced its refund rate from 100% to 70%.</p>  <p>  For 2017, five local authorities chose to amend the refund rate they had for 2016. Dublin City Council reduced from 50% to 45%, Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council reduced from 75% to 50%, Fingal County Council reduced from 100% to 75%, Limerick City and County Council reduced from 25% to 10% and Waterford City and County Council reduced from 70% to 55%.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-16a.5003.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018011600141#WRGGGG02100"><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State. HAP plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals.  There are currently more than 31,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP including over 8,500 households that were previously supported by Rent Supplement and over 20,000 landlords and agents in receipt of HAP payments.</p><p>Budget 2018 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme by &euro;149m to &euro;301 million in order to meet the continuing costs of existing households and the costs of meeting the additional 17,000 households, targeted under Rebuilding Ireland, to be supported by HAP in 2018.</p><p>The increased rent limits introduced by this Government in 2016, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing  HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords. </p><p>From available data, at the end of Q3 2017, approximately 20% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region is removed, 14.4% of households nationally were benefitting from the additional flexibility.  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.9% above rent limits provided.</p><p>My Department monitors HAP data on an ongoing basis, as well as other key information relating to the private rental market. Indications are that the current HAP rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs. Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. Based on the data outlined above, I am currently satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to meet the demand of the rental market in these areas.</p><p>The Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, recommended the introduction of a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising - where households have greatest difficulties in finding accommodation they can afford.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for the Rent Predictability Measure and for areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents can now only rise by a maximum of 4% annually for a period of three years.</p><p>This measure was implemented immediately in the four Dublin local authority areas and in Cork City as these areas already met the criteria for a Rent Pressure Zone in December 2016.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) were designated in January 2017, with the measure further extended to Maynooth and Cobh LEAs in March 2017 and to Drogheda and Greystones LEAs in September 2017.</p><p>On 19 September 2017, I announced a number of improvements to the rental market as part of the rolling review of Rebuilding Ireland.  One such change is that the RTB will be given additional powers and resources to take on a regulatory responsibility in the rental sector over the next two years.  The changes needed in legislation and in the Board&rsquo;s financing arrangements will be explored and a two-year change management plan will be prepared that will see the RTB become the sector&rsquo;s regulator in that period.  It will be an offence to implement rent increases that contravene the law and the RTB will be given the powers to investigate and prosecute landlords who implement such increases. The onus will no longer be exclusively on the tenant.</p><p>HAP is one of a suite of Social Housing Supports available to Local Authorities and is also an essential component of our suite of homelessness prevention and supports.  The Homeless HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE).  The focus of this scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  A Place Finder service, similar to the service available in Dublin, became operational in Cork City Council in 2017 and provides a dedicated resource that operates together with the established HAP delivery team in the local authority. </p><p>I announced recently that the Place Finder support is to be rolled out nationally providing homeless support staff in each of the 31 local authorities with the tools to target HAP supported rental properties for homeless households, with a particular focus of moving families out of emergency accommodation.  This means that every local authority will be able to pay deposits and advance rental payment on behalf of homeless households in order to secure accommodation.  The existing Place Finder service in Dublin is also being enhanced, with additional staff being assigned to provide on the ground support in each of the relevant local authority areas. Arrangements for the provision of these supports are currently being progressed by my Department together with the local authorities. </p><p>The flexibility of HAP as a social housing support is one of the scheme's key characteristics and was one of the primary benefits envisaged at the outset of the scheme.  With this in mind, early last year direction and guidance was provided to all local authorities related to the operation of HAP cases whereby a tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area. </p><p>I have directed local authorities to provide that HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority.  However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated.  The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement.  Where homeless households have sourced or been assisted by the Place Finder Service in sourcing accommodation outside the Dublin area, the relevant rate of support is based on the rent limits that apply in the local authority where the property is situated.  The DRHE have been advised to consult with the new local authority in relation to the appropriate level of support that should be provided.  However, the Place Finder Service can still pay a deposit and rent in advance on behalf of the tenant.</p><p>In order to maintain the equitable treatment of all housing applicants, inter-authority movement for HAP applicants is based on the current Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands, i.e. movement will only be facilitated across local authorities with Income Bands that are equal or higher; or where shared areas of choice are already operated.</p><p>The following table provides details of the inter-authority movement since April, when the option was made available:<table><tr><th colspan="2">Summer of Inter-LA Movement (as at 19 Jul 2017)</th></tr><tr><td>Intra Dublin</td><td>583</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin to other LA's</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>All other inter-LA movement</td><td>322</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>960</td></tr></table></p><p>I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is currently operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.  My Department will, of course, continue to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. </p><p>Rent Supplement is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  </p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>  <p>  My Department is collating the ARVs adopted by local authorities for 2018; however, the full list is not available at this time as the formal publication process for all adopted 2018 local authority budgets has not yet been completed.  A full list will be provided to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.

At the end of the consultation, which also involves the local planning authority concerned, the Board issues its opinion as to whether the documents submitted with the consultation request constitute a reasonable basis for a planning application to be submitted or alternatively require further consideration and amendment in order to constitute a reasonable basis for an application.</p><p>Further to the submission of a planning application to the Board for a proposed strategic housing development, the Board is required to make a determination on such application within a period of 16 weeks of the lodgment of the application. </p><p>In the six months since the new arrangements came into operation, i.e. from 3 July 2017 up until 31 December 2017, the Board received 36 valid pre-application consultation requests in respect of which 25 opinions have already issued, with further opinions to issue in 2018. </p><p>Up until 11 January, 14 planning applications for strategic housing developments have been made to the Board.  The Board issued a decision on the first strategic housing development application on 11 January 2018, granting, in part and subject to conditions, an application for student accommodation at University College Dublin.  The Board made a decision earlier this week to refuse a second application for residential development at Clay Farm, Ballyogan Road, Dublin 18.  A notice of these decisions, along with information on other applications received and to be determined in 2018 which includes weblinks to access full details of each application, is available on An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s website at the following link: .  Decisions by the Board on the other 12 strategic housing development applications currently before the Board are expected to be made between now and end-April 2018. </p><p>Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (the Act), I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be involved. Therefore, I cannot comment on an individual planning case or any aspect thereof.</p><p>However, a detailed and national level policy approach in relation to residential densities in urban areas is set out in my Department&rsquo;s 2009 <i>Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas,</i>issued under section 28 of the Act. The objective of these Guidelines is to ensure planning authorities bring about high quality and sustainable urban development by balancing the need to ensure the highest standards of residential design which encompasses building lay-out, design and heights and the need to ensure efficient use of scarce land and infrastructural resources and the avoidance of urban sprawl. </p><p>Planning authorities, and, where applicable, the Board, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. </p></reply>

In addition, statistics relating to readership of national and regional newspapers, listenership to local radio and increased use of social media,  particularly by younger people, all informed the choices made.  The Programme was also designed to have as wide a reach as possible, including in rural areas. </p>  <p>  Pending the tendering for services in relation to media management, my Department continued to use the services of a company which had been engaged during the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme.  This was short-term only for the provision of these services and my Department has since held a new tender competition for the provision of similar services should they be required in 2018 and has awarded a contract in this regard.  </p>  <p>  As part of the contract requirements the media management company produced reports and statistics in relation to all elements of the engagement programme including digital platforms. The high-quality content across all platforms including print and digital has been well received across the country.  My Department is satisfied that in the initial year of the Creative Ireland Programme, such a widespread communications strategy was warranted and presented value for money.  </p>  <p>  Most recent figures show the following numbers:</p>  <p>  Creative.ireland.ie(website) &ndash; 130,272 page views</p>  <p>  Ireland.ie (website) &ndash; 138,388 page views</p>  <p>  Creative Ireland facebook &ndash; 17,261 followers</p>  <p>  Creative Ireland Twitter &ndash; 15,800 followers</p>  <p>  A full expenditure breakdown of the &euro;0.9m, including social media is provided on the Creative Ireland Programme website: www.creative.ireland.ie</p></reply>

An additional &euro;83,579 was spent on design, artwork, print and online  distribution of the 31 sets of plans with a further &euro;13,040 spent on translating the plans into Irish. The &euro;1m allocation was bolstered by an additional &euro;1m from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government ensuring that each local authority received approximately &euro;64,000 each to implement their Culture and Creativity Plans for 2017. In total, the plans listed over 750 local cultural projects, events and initiatives taking place nationwide in 2017 of which approximately 250 were funded through the enabling budget provided under the Creative Ireland Programme. </p><p>A key principle underpinning the Creative Ireland Programme is community empowerment and therefore each local authority decided themselves what events/projects they wished to include in their respective plans. It is therefore not possible at this point in time to provide an exact breakdown of costs for each activity for every local authority.  However, this information -in accordance with normal departmental monitoring procedures and in line with the reporting requirements specific to this initiative - will be submitted by each local authority over the coming weeks.  </p><p>A breakdown of the total allocation to the local authorities is outlined in the following table as requested.

This was bolstered by an additional &euro;1m from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  In total, the plans listed over 750 projects, events and initiatives taking place nationwide in 2017 of which an estimated 250 were directly attributable to the Creative Ireland Programme.  Many of these projects, events and initiatives involved the work of creative professionals, including artists.  However, it is not possible to say<b></b>precisely how many artists received direct funding through this structure.  In addition, my Department organised a number of Creative Ireland Programme elements as part of established festivals and events in 2017. <b></b>Performers at Creative Ireland Programme launches and events were paid performance fees as detailed in the breakdown.  It should also be noted that the Department, through RT&Eacute;, supported a number of artists and creative practitioners as part of Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca.</p><p>All costs for 2017 including the costs for Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca, citizen engagement and all other activity is included in the breakdown of costs as referred to above.</p></reply>

Draft data, maps and reports have also been provided. Other associated environmental data and survey findings (e.g. hydrology, hydrogeology, soils, etc.) were reported on and discussed.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that decisions in relation to Environmental Impact Assessment and Appropriate Assessment will fall to an Bord Pleanala,  my Department is now dedicating significant resources in assisting the local authority by carrying out a full review of the most up-to-date draft of EIS/NIS; such work would not normally be undertaken by my Department at this stage but has agreed to do so in the case of this important project.

The OPW conducts ongoing monitoring of visitor numbers to the site which has open access all year round and which is used in large numbers by the local community as well as by many other visitors. This data will assist with the development of dedicated actions and appropriate management structures to deal with visitors while also ensuring the conservation of the site.

This figure exceeds the current target of 3% set out in the legislation. The Act defines disability as:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Disability in relation to a person, means a substantial restriction in the capability of the person to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the aggregate proportion of employees who have a disability, as per the definition, in the State Agencies under my remit is 4.8%. The figure in each individual Agency varies, with not all reaching the 3% target. The National Disability Authority has, however, acknowledged the difficulty of organisations with low staffing levels to meet this target. </p>  <p>  These figures were reported to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in March 2017 in fulfilment of the Department's obligations under Part 5 of the Disability Act, and are the latest figures available. </p></reply>
