Since 2009, the scheme has supported the renovation of almost 97,000 homes in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, energy efficiency upgrades are provided free of charge to those households who meet the application criteria.  Measures are provided under the scheme on an "as needed" basis and include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation. </p>  <p>  Window and door insulation are not currently supported under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme due to the need to balance the limited resources available with the demands for this scheme.  Therefore, the measures currently supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost. While both window and door insulation do improve the energy efficiency of a home, the cost of such measures is high in relation to the energy efficiency gains made.</p></reply>

The Eircode Finder, is an eircode look up application that helps citizens and business to fully utilise the new postcode system.  There was significant interest in the &lsquo;Eircode finder tool&rsquo; on launch day with over 800,000 look ups when it went live. During the three weeks following the launch, the 2.2 million residential and business address in Ireland received a letter in the post informing them of the new eircode for that address.</p><p>A successful national information campaign was completed over the summer to inform the public about eircodes and promote their usage.  The campaign included advertisements in the national media, including TV, radio and newspapers. The media campaign ran until 30 August 2015. </p><p>An integral element of the communications strategy was the Community Outreach Programme for eircodes using networks of community and voluntary organisations, in conjunction with the Wheel and Irish Rural Link.  The aim of this programme was to provide information on eircodes and their benefits to people and groups that mainstream communications may not have reached.  This approach allowed any concerns to be addressed locally in a timely manner.  Over the course of the Community Outreach Programme 15,377 organisations received information about Eircode with 10,620 volunteers recruited to assist. During this phase 4,722 local organisations were mobilised and 1,235 events were held involving the target group.</p><p>During the dissemination phase of eircodes, Am&aacute;rach, an independent body, conducted two parallel surveys, a face-to-face survey of 1,200 households and 200 business premises.  The results of the surveys showed that 89% of the public knew the eircode for their address.</p><p>Public Sector bodies, particularly those with large customer facing operations, have started using eircodes in customer engagement and this process will continue over the coming months.</p><p>Since launch the Eircode contractor has been engaging with commercial organisations and, to date, has signed up a total of eighteen Value Added Resellers who provide a broad spectrum of eircode specialist services to businesses including Database cleansing, Address lookup and GeoCoding.  In accordance with the contract for the development and maintenance of eircodes, my Department has put in place reporting structures with the contractor which will, inter alia, include information on the commercial use of the Eircode system.</p></reply>

It sets out the key elements of the intervention - what services are proposed and how they will be delivered. It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned.  The draft Intervention Strategy has been developed following intensive engagement with industry and wider stakeholders. </p>  <p>  In addition, the European Commission has set out detailed guidelines on what is required to obtain State Aid approval for Government interventions in the broadband sector. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has followed these guidelines when formulating the proposed intervention strategy. Key among those guidelines is the requirement to observe a strict policy of technology neutrality in designing an intervention programme and in running a procurement process.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department cannot and will not specify any particular technology platform when going to the market to secure a potential bidder or bidders for the NBP contract. It will be up to bidders to set out clearly in their bid how they propose to meet the standard of services being sought by the Government. However, it is anticipated that any proposals from bidders will have fibre technology as a key element within their solution. It is recognised within industry that fibre is the technology of choice for at least the backhaul part of the network. </p>  <p>  The Strategy demonstrates clearly the Government&rsquo;s commitment to honouring its pledge to deal definitively with the challenge of providing resilient and high-quality broadband connectivity to every premises in the country, irrespective of location.</p></reply>

This public consultation closes on the 25<sup>th</sup>of this month. Following the consultation process, the Minister plans to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.The physical build of the network is expected to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected. </p><p>This complex national infrastructure project will definitively address the long-standing challenge of deploying a resilient and high-quality broadband network, particularly in rural parts of Ireland.</p><p>An intrinsic part of the Department's approach to planning and developing the NBP strategy has been to engage with all stakeholders and, in particular, with industry. This engagement has enabled the production of the national high speed broadband coverage map in November last which is currently being updated, again in close collaboration with industry.</p><p>Details of meetings with industry and of site visits to particular trials or projects being run by individual operators are provided in the Department's monthly NBP update which is available on the Department's website and which is emailed to all Oireachtas members. </p><p>Departmental officials will continue to liaise closely with the commercial operators until such time as the project moves to formal procurement phase.</p></reply>

The purpose of the trade negotiations is to reduce barriers to trade and investment in order to generate jobs and growth. Ireland stands to gain significantly from this because of the existing significant flows of trade and investment between Ireland and the US and briefing and update material on these negotiations can be found on the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i>I can assure the Deputy that conclusion of an agreement will have no impact on the public policy approach adopted by Ireland in the area of exploration for hydrocarbon resources. </p><p>The scope of the EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the United States includes investment protection and investor state dispute settlement. Countries sign such agreements in order to set out certain ground rules when foreign companies invest on their territory. The EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate clearly provides that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of the EU and Member States to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety, in a non-discriminatory manner.</p></reply>

Since its publication the Department undertook a public consultation process which included analysis of over 1200 written submissions and thirteen stakeholder seminars, held in Dublin, Westmeath, Sligo, Cork and Wexford, on the various priority areas highlighted in the Green Paper.  A recurring message coming from both the written submissions and the seminars was the role that community energy could play in our future energy systems. The views submitted are being considered in the formation of the Energy White Paper, which will be published before the end of the year, and which will, <i>inter alia,</i>address community energy projects and how best to facilitate communities in playing their part.</p><p>I should also highlight the various community level initiatives administered on behalf of the Department by the SEAI. These include the development of community energy projects through the Better Energy Areas and Communities Programme which allows community and locally based organisations to apply for funding on a competitive basis to support sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings and facilities. It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can engage and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost local employment.</p></reply>

The rates of tariff for AD technologies available under the scheme were calculated following analysis by the Department along with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, and Teagasc. Since the introduction of the scheme in 2012, the Department has received a number of applications from AD plants for support.</p>  <p>  The cost effectiveness of support for renewables is a key consideration in the work now underway in the Department to consider the appropriateness and design of new support schemes for renewable electricity and renewable heat. The initial public consultations on the two proposed new schemes for heat and electricity respectively closed on Friday, 18 September 2015. There will be a further two opportunities for the public to contribute to the development of the schemes. A key consideration in the design of the schemes will be the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of any support required. Both schemes are expected to be available in 2016 subject to EU state aid clearance and Government approval.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that academic and industry research suggests that there is the potential for a significant role in the heat and transport sectors for biogas, which is produced by anaerobic digestion. The draft Bioenergy Plan, published by the Minister last year, recommended that a detailed economic assessment of the costs and benefits of biogas would be conducted. </p>  <p>  The Bioenergy Steering Group, which has been established to coordinate the implementation of the draft Plan, is currently finalising the request for tender document and the Department expects to be inviting tenders for this work shortly.</p></reply>

Offshore renewable energy has the potential to: generate carbon free renewable electricity; reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels; enhance our security of energy supply; and deliver green growth and jobs to the economy.</p>  <p>  Policy action across a range of areas is required to support developers in bringing ocean energy devices, including wave and tidal, from prototype to full scale commerciality. Such action is being taken in the context of the implementation of the 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which sets out Government policy in relation to the sustainable development of Ireland's abundant offshore renewable energy resources. A Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR), has been established which includes representatives from other relevant government departments and agencies. The Steering Group is overseeing the implementation of the Plan. </p>  <p>  Exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration has been provided to the sector in recent years and is being increased under the OREDP. In total, my Department has allocated &euro;26.3 million for ocean energy for the period 2013 to 2016. This supports the development of the test sites in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, the Integrated Maritime Energy Resource Cluster (IMERC) at Ringaskiddy, and the Prototype Development Fund operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which provides grant aid for the development of prototype ocean energy devices. </p>  <p>  Further funding options are being discussed cross-departmentally and the OREDP also proposes, subject to further Government approval, an initial market support scheme for wave and tidal energy from 2016 onwards.</p></reply>

As part of this work, officials are participating in the European Commission's Vulnerable Consumers Working Group having participated in the Energy Citizens Forum held in London in March of this year. I welcome this European Commission initiative along with the publication by the Commission in July of this year of their Communication &quot;Delivering a New Deal for Energy Consumers&quot;.</p><p>That Commission Communication is a supporting policy document to the Energy Union Framework Strategy which sets out the vision of an Energy Union &quot;<i>with citizens at its core, where citizens take ownership of the energy transition, benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills, participate actively in the market, and where vulnerable consumers are protected</i>&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Delivering a New Deal for Energy Consumers&quot; identified energy poverty as an important issue requiring Member State action. The Communication also identified energy efficiency as the best way to address energy poverty in the long term, while recognising that this must take place in the wider context of action on poverty. It is the stated position of the Commission that the citizen must be at the heart of the new Energy Union. This means that both the EU, and Member States, must find more effective ways to address energy poverty as part of the action also needed to support and empower energy consumers. The Minister will continue to push for energy poverty to be kept high on the EU energy agenda, and ensure that improving the energy efficiency of homes of those vulnerable to energy poverty remains central to Ireland&rsquo;s Better Energy Programme.</p><p>The Minister expects to publish the new Affordable Energy Strategy around the end of this year.</p></reply>

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended. Licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.</p><p>However, given that mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors. These include topography, the capacity of the network and more generally the level and quality of access customers have to mobile phone antennas. Difficulties for service providers in erecting masts and antennas due to planning issues can also impact negatively on the quality of coverage experienced by consumers.</p><p>In terms of improving the quality and coverage of mobile services in all areas throughout the country, there are various initiatives underway to achieve this aim. </p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising both fixed and mobile networks. This includes some &euro;850m invested in acquiring spectrum under the 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction run by ComReg. Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide. These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country, although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place.</p><p>While investment in communications infrastructure and services is primarily a matter for the private sector, the National Broadband Plan (NBP) commits to a range of actions that will facilitate the more efficient<font color="#1F497D"> </font>commercial<font color="#1F497D"> </font>investment in the rollout of communications infrastru<font color="#1F497D">c</font>ture.</p><p>The NBP is a Government policy initiative which aims to deliver high speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland. This is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a proposed State intervention to provide high speed broadband to those parts of the country where the commercial sector will not invest. </p><p>The NBP proposed Intervention Strategy document, which was published on 15 July last, sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention. It sets out the key elements of the intervention - what services are proposed and how they will be delivered. It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan in 2012, a working group has been established to address infrastructure issues which were identified by industry as creating barriers to deployment of services. The group is chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority (NRA) and Local Authorities. The Group is currently consulting with industry on a range of issues relating to the siting of telecommunications infrastructure. My Department will continue to actively engage on this issue with a view to facilitating the removal of barriers and the improvement of mobile service nationwide. </p><p>Local Authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae etc. The Telecommunications and Internet Federation (TIF, which is part of IBEC) has been proactive in seeking to meet with Local Authorities and public representatives to fully discuss the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers experience.</p><p>I would encourage all Local Authorities and public representatives to engage with the TIF on these important issues.</p></reply>

It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can engage and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost local employment.</p>  <p>  One of the central themes in the Green Paper on Energy Policy, published in May 2014, is citizen empowerment. Since its publication the Department undertook a public consultation process which included analysis of over 1200 written submissions and thirteen stakeholder seminars, held in Dublin, Westmeath, Sligo, Cork and Wexford, on the various priority areas highlighted in the Green Paper.

The classification for unemployed persons includes those persons aged 15-74 years who, in the week before the survey, were without work and available for work within the next two weeks, and had taken specific steps, in the preceding four weeks, to find work.  The QNHS does not capture a respondent's status as measured by the Live Register.</p>  <p>  The Live Register is compiled from returns made for each local office to the Central Statistics Office by the Department of Social Protection.  It comprises persons under 65 years of age in the following classes:</p>  <p>  All Claimants for Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) excluding systematic short-time workers.</p>  <p>  Applicants for Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) excluding smallholders/farm assists and other self-employed persons.</p>  <p>  Other registrants including applicants for credited Social Welfare contributions but excluding those directly involved in an industrial dispute.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment as per the ILO unemployment classification used by the QNHS.  It includes part-time workers (those who work up to three days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance.</p></reply>

After lengthy and difficult discussions, the Euro Summit reached agreement on a series of measures that enabled negotiations on a third programme of assistance to begin between Greece and the Institutions.  Satisfactory progress in these negotiations, supported by the urgent implementation by Greece of a number of demanding conditions, allowed for a political agreement to be reached at Eurogroup level on 14 August and for a first disbursement of additional support on 20 August.</p>  <p>  At the European Council meeting of 25-26 June, Heads of State and Government urged Prime Minister Tsipras to make every effort to conclude an agreement and put an end to the instability which was having such a detrimental effect on the Greek economy and people.  At that time, negotiations were being taken forward with the Institutions and by Finance Ministers through the Eurogroup.  However, following the breaking off of negotiations by the Greek government, the holding of a referendum on 5 July, and the radical deterioration of Greece&rsquo;s financial situation, the situation in Greece was felt to require a special Euro Summit meeting on 7 July.  It was agreed that the Greek government would, on Thursday 9 July at the latest, present proposals for a comprehensive and specific reform agenda for assessment by the three institutions and presentation to the Eurogroup.  The Eurogroup considered these proposals at meetings on 11 and 12 July, prior to the meeting of the Euro Summit.</p>  <p>  Throughout all of the European Council and Euro Summit negotiations, I expressed Ireland's understanding and empathy with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  I highlighted our willingness to negotiate a way forward and achieve a sustainable solution that took account of the realities of the situation in Greece, while also respecting existing commitments.  I stressed our determination to ensure that Greece can continue as a member of the euro area.  At both of the Euro Summits in July, I intervened along these lines, and participated in the Summit&rsquo;s negotiations on the texts of the Conclusions. </p>  <p>  The negotiations were undoubtedly difficult and Greece remains in a very challenging situation.  However, if the agreed measures continue to be taken forward swiftly in accordance with the commitments made, as they have been to date, I believe that there is a real basis for Greece, with the support of partners, to return to stability and growth within the euro area.  That is the objective towards which we have all worked and will continue to work. </p></reply>

Internal Audit Charter



1.0Introduction

1.1This Charter sets out the purpose, authority and responsibilities of the Internal Audit function in the Department of the Taoiseach.



2.0Internal Audit Unit

2.1The Internal Audit Unit&rsquo;s function is to provide assurance to the Accounting Officer on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s system of internal controls.

2.2The Unit operates as a resource for Departmental and Divisional managers through its analysis and appraisal of Departmental control systems.  In its reports the Unit makes recommendations to management based on &lsquo;Best Practice&rsquo;.

2.3The Unit will also act in an advisory capacity to projects under development to ensure the adequacy of control measures.



3.0Internal Audit Committee

3.1The Accounting Officer is the person responsible for appointing the membership of the Internal Audit Committee.  The Committee comprises 2 Department officials and 2 external representatives from another Government Department.  The Accounting Officer may change the membership of the Committee as and when required.

The current membership of the Audit Committee is as follows: -</p><p>3.2Although not members of the Committee, the Heads of the Finance Unit and Internal Audit Unit may attend Committee meetings.  The managers of any Divisions or Offices may attend Committee meetings discussing internal audit reports on their particular sections.  The Committee mayoccasionally decide to hold meetings without these managers (including the Head of the Finance Unit) being present.

3.3.The Internal Audit Committee will consider the work of the Internal Audit Unit comprising audit reports that have been submitted, the schedule of work (Work Programmes) and other matters as appropriate.

3.4The operation of the Internal Audit Committee will be reviewed by the Accounting Officer, the Chairperson of the Committee and the Head of the Internal Audit Unit after a three-year period. 

3.5The Internal Audit Committee should ensure &lsquo;Quality Assurance Reviews&rsquo; of the Internal Audit Unit on a regular basis, i.e. at least once every five years.



4.0Responsibilities

4.1The Internal Audit Unit operates as an independent advisory service and outside of this has no operational role.  Responsibility for internal control rests with managers who, without regard to audit activity, ensure that appropriate and adequate control arrangements exist in their areas of responsibility.  The role of internal audit is to appraise the adequacy and effectiveness of those arrangements and to make recommendations for improvements as appropriate.

4.2It is for managers and Departmental management to decide upon the appropriate response to reports and recommendations of internal audit.

4.3The Internal Audit Unit will liaise, as necessary and appropriate, with external auditors, including the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

4.4The Internal Audit Unit is authorised to have full access to Departmental records (manual and electronic), physical properties and personnel relevant to the carrying out of a review.  It will be responsible for affording to records and other materials entrusted to its care, the same protections afforded by staff in whose care they normally are retained.</p><p>5.0Scope

5.1The Internal Audit Unit will, in general, adopt a systems-based approach to its audits supplemented, where appropriate, by the use of traditional transaction-testing, vouching and verification methods .

5.2The Internal Audit Unit will be responsible for reviewing and appraising the following: -

5.2.1the design and operation of all systems and procedures (financial, managerial etc.) which are intended to control the Department's operations, including those used by management to measure the effectiveness of programmes and other activities of the Department;

5.2.2the adequacy, reliability and integrity of the information systems used to monitor the Department&rsquo;s activities and to ensure accountability;

5.2.3the degree of compliance with (a) legislation (domestic and international) and other requirements laid down centrally (e.g. by the Department of Finance) and (b) management plans, procedures and policies;

5.2.4the acquisition and disposal of assets and the safeguarding of assets and interests from losses, including those arising from fraud, malpractice and irregularity;</p><p>6.0Reporting Accountabilities

6.1The Head of the Internal Audit Unit will report to the Internal Audit Committee on a regular basis, as agreed in the context of the Annual Work programme, and in particular circumstances, as requested by the Accounting Officer/Internal Audit Committee.

6.2.Audit reports prepared by the Internal Auditor will be submitted to the Accounting Officer by the Head of Internal Audit.  A copy of the reports will also be circulated to the Internal Audit Committee which in turn will submit its observations on reports to the Accounting Officer.

6.3The Internal Audit Committee will submit an annual report to the Accounting Officer.  A copy will be provided, for information, to the Taoiseach.



7.0Resourcing

7.1The Expenses of the Internal Audit function shall be met from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.



8.0Conflict of Interest

8.1.In view of the relatively small size of the Department and the need to make the most efficient use of resources the Head of the Internal Audit Unit will be assigned on a part-time basis.  However, to ensure an appropriate level of access within the Department and that particular concerns and recommendations are acted upon,  he/she shall be at Principal Officer level and will perform the audit role in addition to his/her Divisional duties within the Department.  

8.2.Should for any reason a matter arise relating to the Principal Officer&rsquo;s dual roles where a potential conflict of interest might arise then he/she should advise the Chairman of the Audit Committee accordingly who will ensure that appropriate steps are taken.

This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. </p><p>Youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 22.4% in Q2 2015, as compared to 26.9% in Q2 2014).  These figures are not adjusted for seasonality; the seasonally-adjusted rate published by the Central Statistics Office as of August 2015 was 20.7%.</p><p>The number of young people who are long-term unemployed has fallen from 35,000 in mid-2012 (46% of all the young unemployed at that time) to 13,000 (31% of all the young unemployed) in mid-2015.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy and the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.</p></reply>

This income has been for many years treated in the same manner as earnings from employment for PRSI purposes and accordingly is subject to Class A PRSI.  Therefore participants on CE schemes, similar to other private sector employees who pay Class A, can establish entitlement to the full range of short term benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit, and maternity benefit and to long term benefits including State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  As of 31 August 2015, there were 1,957 CE participants in receipt of payments in excess of &euro;352 per week and who would therefore be liable to make an employee PRSI contribution.  For over 98% of these CE participants there is a financial incentive to participate in the scheme as the net amount of their CE payment exceeds their underlying social welfare entitlement.</p>  <p>  Any proposed PRSI exemption for CE participants paying PRSI would have to apply to all workers similarly paying PRSI and with access to the same level of social insurance benefits.  This would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

On that date, approximately 25,500 affected customers were supported by the Department to transition to a range of alternative income support payments.</p>  <p>  In the months in advance of the implementation of the final phase of reforms to the one-parent family payment scheme, the Department contacted all affected lone parents and invited them to attend information seminars.  At these seminars lone parents were advised of the best possible options available to them depending on their circumstances.</p>  <p>  Of the affected 25,500 customers, approximately 96% transitioned to another social welfare payment, of which 13,500 transitioned to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST), 2,500 transitioned to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment (JA), and 8,100 transitioned to the family income supplement (FIS).  The 8,100 customers who transitioned to the family income supplement are also eligible for the back to work family dividend (BTWFD) and a large proportion of these customers have already availed of the dividend.</p>  <p>  Since the changes came into effect the Department has written to affected lone parents and invited them to participate in a meeting with a case officer with a view to improving their employment prospects.</p></reply>

It is paid to around 616,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014.  Child Benefit continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability.  I am conscious that Child Benefit is an important source of income for all families and in Budget 2015 the Government increased child benefit by &euro;5 per month, at a cost of &euro;72 million. </p>  <p>  Budget 2009 provided for the reduction of the age for which Child Benefit is paid from under 19 years to under 18 years.  This measure was implemented in full in 2011 and has resulted in savings of &euro;79 million on an annual basis.  A value for money review of child income supports undertaken by the Department of Social Protection in 2010 found that participation patterns in education support the 18 year age limit for Child Benefit. </p>  <p>  The estimated cost of reversing the budgetary decision made in 2010 to terminate Child Benefit payments at 18 years of age and to extend the upper age limit for those in education to 19 years would be in the region of &euro;58 million in a full year.  Any changes to the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit could only be decided in a budgetary context. </p></reply>

While the Department&rsquo;s response times for carers benefit has increased slightly from 6.2 weeks in 2011 to 8.4 weeks at end of August 2015, the response time to requests for submissions to the Department for appeals of carers allowance has reduced from an average of 17.9 weeks in 2011 to 12.9 weeks at end August 2015.</p>  <p>  Processing times are calculated from the registration date to the date of finalisation and include time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant and time in the Department for review and preparation of its appeal submission, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that an individual can maximise their entitlement to an SPC, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Under this system, the rate of the SPC is related to the average contributions paid (or credited) over their working life.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 52 contributions (i.e. 100%) would generally receive a full rate pension (personal rate &euro;230.30), whereas someone with a yearly average of only 30 contributions paid or credited would have an entitlement, under the SPC, to a weekly personal rate of &euro;207, which is 90% of the maximum rate.  If such a pensioner was paid the same rate of contributory pension as someone who had paid into the social insurance system all their working life, it would mean there was no benefit derived from the much greater contribution made by that person.  As it is, the benefit derived from paying PRSI is greater, in relative terms, for those with limited contribution records and who receive lower rate pensions, than it is for full-rate pensioners.</p>  <p>  Where an older person qualifies for the reduced rate SPC of &euro;207, but they do not have other income (such as a private pension), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  In such cases they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the SPC.  </p>  <p>  If a person does not believe that my Department has calculated their pension entitlements correctly, they may request that the decision be reviewed in the first instance, or they may appeal it to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p></reply>

These supports play an important role in facilitating increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the EmployAbility (supported employment) service, the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities and the disability awareness training scheme.  For those who are in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit (for at least six months) and who feel they now have some capacity for work, the partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme allows them to work and retain a portion of their social welfare payment. People on disability-related payments also have access to activation programmes such as Community employment and Jobbridge administered by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Unlike job-seekers where participation in activation measures through the Intreo service is mandatory, in the case of persons in receipt of disability/illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis and at all times they are free to contact the Intreo service.  The Department has trialled in ten locations provision of full activation supports to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the Intreo service and will consider expansion to other locations on the basis of operational experience. </p>  <p>  The Momentum programme is funded by the  Department of Education and Skills through Solas and is designed on a payments by results basis specifically for long-term unemployed jobseekers. The Department of social Protection, through Intreo, identifies and refers eligible and suitable clients to the Momentum programme. The current phase of Momentum is coming to a conclusion and a decision has yet to be taken on whether or not it will operate again next year. Should it be decided to repeat the programme, the Department will together with the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS consider if, and if so how, eligibility be extended to people with disabilities.</p></reply>

This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. </p><p>Youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 22.4% in Q2 2015, as compared to 26.9% in Q2 2014). These figures are not adjusted for seasonality; the seasonally-adjusted rate as of August 2015 was 20.7%.</p><p>The number of young people who are long-term unemployed has fallen from 35,000 in mid-2012 (46% of all the young unemployed at that time) to 13,000 (31% of all the young unemployed) in mid-2015.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy and the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.</p></reply>

WALK Peer supported a total of 119 participants during the lifetime of the project, with 12 participants remaining in education or some form of employment after 12 months.</p><p>The objective of the DACT project was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.  A key criterion applied when selecting projects was that any learning from the projects should be capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the future.</p><p>The Department commissioned Indecon International Economic Consultants to undertake an independent evaluation of the DACT project as a whole.

The scheme provides financial incentives to private sector employers to hire people with a disability for between 21 and 39 hours per week under a contract of employment.</p>  <p>  The issue of extending eligibility for the WSS to employers who employ people in receipt of PCB, is now being considered in the context of revising the WSS operational guidelines, but budgetary considerations will be a key factor in arriving at a final decision on the matter.</p></reply>

This year it is estimated that there will be a weekly average of 24,000 recipients of maternity benefit at a cost of &euro;254 million.  </p><p>The fundamental qualification criterion for maternity benefit is that a woman must be in insurable employment or self-employment and is contingent on entitlement to statutory maternity leave.  </p><p>PRSI contributions paid prior to one year before a woman takes maternity leave are taken into account when calculating entitlement to maternity benefit.  The woman must also satisfy one of following PRSI contribution conditions: </p><p>i39 weeks PRSI paid in the 12 months before the first day of her maternity leave; or</p><p>ii have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and at least 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the Relevant Tax Year or in the year following the Relevant Tax Year; or</p><p>iii have at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the Relevant Tax Year and at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the Tax Year prior to the Relevant Tax Year.</p><p>The Relevant Tax Year is the second last complete income tax year before the year in which the maternity leave starts. For example, for claims that start in 2015, the relevant tax year is 2013.</p><p>For a person in self-employment, she must have sufficient earnings (&euro;5,000 per annum) in the year of her confinement to be liable to pay income tax and PRSI.  In addition to being in insurable self-employment the woman must also satisfy one of the following PRSI contribution conditions:</p><p>ihave 52 qualifying PRSI conditions paid in the relevant tax year; or</p><p>iihave 52 qualifying contributions paid in the tax year prior to the relevant tax year; or</p><p>iiihave 52 qualifying contributions paid in the tax year following the relevant tax year.</p><p>Self-employment contributions, Class S PRSI, are not awarded for any particular year until all liabilities for that year are paid.  Where a woman has recently set up as a self-employed person or historically has earnings from self-employment below the &euro;5,000 threshold, it may not be possible to qualify for her payment until such time as her reckonable income and Class S liability for the year in question can confirmed.  In cases where the Department finds that a self-employed customer has a record of earnings in excess of &euro;5,000 in previous years and has an expected due date early in the tax year (i.e. within the first 16 weeks), her earnings in the previous year, if greater than &euro;5,000, can be used as confirmation of her insurable status.  </p><p>All applications for maternity benefit from self-employed women are processed on a case by case basis and every effort is made to qualify the customer for payment where possible and in accordance with legislative provisions.  </p><p>There are currently no plans to change the eligibility conditions for the maternity benefit.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people. </p>  <p>  A range of services are available to unemployed persons who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.   </p>  <p>  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of qualifying payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.   </p>  <p>  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme. Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment. </p>  <p>  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability. In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances. Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status. </p>  <p>  In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.</p></reply>

Free travel is also available on cross border journeys to and from Northern Ireland.  Customers aged 66 years and over can travel for free on journeys within Northern Ireland. There are currently approximately 836,000 customers in receipt of free travel. </p>  <p>  In 2012, along with the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I established an interdepartmental working group to review the free travel scheme, comprising officials from the Department of Social Protection, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the review was to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme.  Owing to the range of policy changes implemented since its establishment, the scheme is now universally available to all persons permanently living in the State aged 66 and over as well as carers in receipt of carers allowance and certain others such as persons in receipt of disability allowance and invalidity pension. </p>  <p>  The interdepartmental group has concluded its work.  The report is being considered by high level officials in my Department and I expect to see a copy of the report shortly.

Free travel is also available on cross border journeys to and from Northern Ireland.  Customers aged 66 years and over can travel for free on journeys within Northern Ireland.  There are currently approximately 836,000 customers in receipt of free travel. </p><p>In 2012, along with the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I established an interdepartmental working group to review the free travel scheme. </p><p>Before the group concluded its deliberations, the policy context changed somewhat with the publication last year of the &ldquo;Statement of Government Priorities, 2014-2016&rdquo; which commits to the &ldquo;full retention of the Free Travel Scheme&rdquo;.</p><p>The terms of reference for the review were to:</p><p><i>&ldquo;1. Clarify the scheme objectives and examine the current validity of the objectives, including their compatibility with the overall strategy of the Department of Social Protection and with national transport strategy;</i></p><p><i>2. Examine the customer group eligible for free travel and, if necessary, make recommendations on the better targeting of the scheme and changes to eligibility;</i></p><p><i>3. Examine the extent of the service provided and, if necessary make recommendations to adjust the service;</i></p><p><i>4. Identify the data on usage which is available, deficiencies in data collection and make recommendations for improving data collection;</i></p><p><i>5. Examine the issue of fraud and control and make recommendations for improvements, particularly in the context of the introduction of the Public Services Card;</i></p><p><i>6. Examine the levels of funding for the Free Travel scheme in the context of overall exchequer funding for transport and the respective roles of PSO and Free Travel funding;</i></p><p><i>7. Consider the interaction between DSP, DTTS, NTA and transport companies, their respective roles and make recommendations for the improvement to the administration of the scheme and the potential for an increased role by the NTA.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The interdepartmental group has concluded its work.  The report is being considered by high level officials in my Department and I expect to see a copy of the report shortly.  While I will read it with interest, I have stated on a number of occasions that I believe that this is a very good scheme which should remain in place, and I am committed to its retention.</p></reply>

These measures were further extended in 2014. Reduced JA rates for jobseeker&rsquo;s who are under 26 years of age is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. </p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall.  For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by EUROSTAT was 20.7% in August 2015 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011.  However, the Government recognises that there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p>  <p>  Any change to the reduced rates of JA for people under 26 is a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

This has been an ongoing issue since October 2014 when the Department received a proposal document from IASE seeking funding of on a long term basis.  (IASE&rsquo;s current source of funding is from the Department of the Environment under the Scheme to Support National Organisations and under this scheme, IASE were granted funding for a two year period from June 2014 to June 2016.)</p>  <p>  In December 2014, IASE were advised that there was no provision in the Department's estimates to provide funding as set out in their proposal and that the Department already delivers a supported employment service for people with disabilities through the EmployAbility service.</p>  <p>  Following further correspondence, a meeting between Department officials and IASE took place in April last. At this meeting, the Department reiterated the point made previously to IASE regarding funding but pointed out that the Department had identified their organisation to the consultants undertaking a review of the EmployAbility (supported employment) service as key stakeholders in this area. The consultants subsequently invited IASE to make a submission. </p>  <p>  The EmployAbility review will be crucial in helping to inform the future policy direction for employment support services for people with disabilities delivered by the Department, and until that review is available &ndash; expected at the end of September &ndash; and its recommendations fully considered, no commitments can be made in relation to the possibility of the Department funding IASE.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department endeavours to respond to representations as expeditiously as feasible and deal with issues of concern to public representatives in a fair and equitable manner. I would point out that while there has been a delay in replying to this particular correspondence, the Department has been dealing with a number of representations in relation to this issue.

The locations where Garda personnel have been assigned are set out below: <table><tr><th>Location</th><th>Location</th><th>Location</th><th>Location</th></tr><tr><td>Coolock</td><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>Bishop&rsquo;s Square</td><td>Tallaght</td></tr><tr><td>Kings Inn</td><td>Clondalkin</td><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>Finglas</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>Dundalk (2)</td><td>Navan</td><td>Letterkenny</td></tr><tr><td>Longford (2)</td><td>Sligo</td><td>Limerick</td><td>Galway</td></tr><tr><td>Cork (2)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>The function of any Garda&iacute; assigned to the SIU is to investigate social welfare fraud.  Garda officers who have been seconded to the Department have been duly appointed as Social Welfare Inspectors with powers provided under the Social Welfare Acts.  They work with officers from the SIU and undertake a range of investigative duties that can, on occasion, include reviews of eligibility to entitlement. Their role is consistent with the functions already performed by Inspectors in the SIU. </p><p>Social welfare entitlements are based on statutory schemes and any withdrawal of these payments following any review has to be based on facts and evidence.  In instances where a decision to disallow a social welfare claim occurs then that person has a right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The seconded officers are actively engaged in the detection and prosecution of more serious cases of identity fraud or multiple claiming of social welfare payments.  A number of successful prosecutions have already been secured through the courts.</p><p>The period of secondment is for 12 months. A review of this secondment is currently being undertaken by the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality.  This review will determine the future of the programme.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  Child benefit is currently paid to around 610,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014.  For twins, Child Benefit is paid at one and a half times the normal monthly rate for each child. For triplets and other multiple births, Child Benefit is paid at double the normal monthly rate for each child.</p>  <p>  Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for child benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the current participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit.</p>  <p>  Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p>  <p>  -	qualified child increases (QCIs) with primary social welfare payments;</p>  <p>  -	family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children;</p>  <p>  -	The back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families. </p>  <p>  This provides a level of assistance which is directly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation. I am satisfied that the social protection system currently provides assistance to families with older children who are participating in full-time education and that this support is targeted at low-income families.</p></reply>

This payment exempts lone parents from the normal jobseeker&rsquo;s conditionality of having to be available for and genuinely seeking full time employment until their youngest child turns 14 years of age. </p>  <p>  The jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment enables a lone parent who wishes to work part time to do so without restriction, provided they satisfy the means test. The introduction of the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment in 2013 means that lone parents whose youngest child is under 14 years of age are not required to seek employment as a condition of their social welfare payment. This therefore allows these customers to balance their caring responsibilities while supporting them to engage in employment or education should they wish to participate.  </p>  <p>  Should a lone parent wish to take up employment, or an education or training course they can seek to avail of a range of subsidised childcare places, which are provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and are available through the County Childcare Committees.</p></reply>

The Survey also found that the at-risk-of-poverty for children decreased from 18.8 per cent in 2012 to 17.9 per cent in 2013. A key driver in reducing income poverty among children is social transfers, which reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 45.5 per cent to 17.9 per cent, thereby lifting a quarter of all children out of poverty. This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 60.7 per cent. Ireland is amongst the best performing member states in the EU in this regard.In Budget 2015, the Government committed a further &euro;96 million for children. This provided for an increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit, the introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend worth &euro;29.80 per child for eligible families returning to work, and an additional &euro;2 million on the School Meals Programme. </p><p>Government policy around tackling poverty for children and families is articulated in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i><i>The national policy framework for children &amp;amp; young people 2014-2020. </i>This includes the adoption of a child-specific social target for poverty reduction aiming to lift 70,000 children out of poverty by 2020, equivalent to a reduction of two-thirds on the 2011 rate.  In line with this target, the Government has committed to implementing a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty, building on the lifecycle approach in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, 2007-2016 and informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;. Tackling child poverty is a priority issue under <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>, and involves a range of government departments and external stakeholders. </p><p>A key way to tackle child poverty is to get parents back to work.

The scheme was first introduced on 1 July 2011, with the objective of bringing unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register closer to the labour market by providing them with the opportunity to develop new skills as well as enhancing existing ones, through the provision of a quality work experience placement.  As of 17 September 2015, more than 42,700 internship placements had commenced and there are currently 4,613 participants on the programme.</p><p>Eligibility for participation on the JobBridge Scheme was initially confined to people in receipt of unemployment payments (i.e. Jobseekers Benefit/Jobseekers allowance) or signing for credits for at least 78 days within the last 6 months, the criteria for which included the requirement that a person must be available for work.</p><p>However, on 28 May 2012, the eligibility criteria for participation on JobBridge was extended to include customers in receipt of Disability Allowance (DA) and One Parent Family Payment (OPFP), schemes for which payment was not dependent on recipients being available to work. On 1 May 2015, the scheme was extended further to include individuals in receipt of Blind Persons Pension/ Deserted Wives Allowance/ Deserted Wives Benefit<b><i>/</i></b>Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s contributory/non-contributory Pension. Recipients of these payments are not counted on the Live Register but are eligible to participate on the JobBridge scheme.</p><p>In addition, unemployed persons not in receipt of qualifying payments may be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses). Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation. Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status. </p><p>Many other services are also available to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices regardless of their social welfare status.</p><p>An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits. Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme. Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment. Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability. In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.</p><p>In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.</p></reply>

The determinations of the Pensions Ombudsman are legally binding on the parties to the complaint/dispute, subject to appeal to the High Court.</p><p>With regard to complaints referred to the Pensions Ombudsman it should be noted that the circumstances and complexity of each complaint can differ and contribute to the length of time taken to complete investigation and adjudication.  It is also worth noting that the time taken to deal with a complaint runs from the date of first contact with the Office even where such contact was on the basis of a preliminary phone call or email query and a detailed submission from the complainant was not supplied until much later.  In addition, it can happen that, in the course of an investigation, additional complaint issues are introduced or that the Office is asked to put its investigation on hold while alternate settlement or resolution proposals are being explored.  Furthermore, cases appealed to the High Court are not considered closed by the Office until the date of judgement and the court process can take several years in some cases.  Such delays, which are often outside the control of the Pensions Ombudsman, add to the time taken to complete the investigation into a complaint and can serve to distort the statistical data.</p><p>While it was recorded in the 2013 Annual Report that one case took more than 8 years to complete, it should be noted that from September 2003 to 31<sup>st</sup>December 2013 the Office has dealt with over 5,400 complaint cases.</p><p>In addition to providing formal adjudication on pension-related complaints, the Pensions Ombudsman has striven to be accessible and to provide assistance and guidance to members of the public experiencing difficulties with their pension.</p><p>The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman produces an annual report, which sets out relevant statistical details of the work undertaken by the Office, as well as examples of the cases dealt with and a commentary on pension difficulties experienced or potentially problematic issues that have come to its attention.</p><p>The Office operates an informative website and has produced several booklets and leaflets to assist the public in understanding the role and function of the Pensions Ombudsman in relation to pension-related complaints.</p><p>Following on from the publication of the Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011 which included measures to rationalise a number of state agencies, the Department of Social Protection was charged with undertaking a critical review of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman.</p><p>The critical review was to consider merging the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Steering Group established to carry out the review concluded that a merger of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman was the appropriate measure to take thereby providing the consumer with a one-stop shop for queries on pensions and financial products.</p><p>Government approval has been given to the Minister for Finance for the draft Heads of a Bill to amalgamate the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman and for the referring of the scheme of the Bill to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting.</p><p>As disputes relating to redundancy and other industrial relations issues come within the remit of workplace relations under the aegis of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, it is not proposed to extend the remit of the Pensions Ombudsman to such matters.</p><p>I have set out hereunder the age breakdown on cases on hands/dealt with.</p><p><b><i>Statistics</i></b></p><p>The annual report for 2013 shows 222 cases on hand at 31 December 2013.

I introduced this scheme in 2013 to provide for repayments by the Revenue Commissioners to qualifying road transport operators of a part of the mineral oil tax paid on their purchases of auto-diesel for use in qualifying vehicles during the course of business. The scheme does not apply to marked gas oil, commonly called green diesel, and, in any case, the use of green diesel in the vehicles that qualify under the scheme is prohibited. </p>  <p>  The Commissioners advise me that they are unable to provide a list of claimants under the scheme as the release of this information would breach taxpayer confidentiality and is prohibited under section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. However, I am advised that 2,156 qualifying road transport operators currently avail of the scheme and &euro;34.3m has been paid to date under the scheme since it was introduced. </p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced, and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  </p>  <p>  The USC, like the Income Levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments or payments of a similar nature.  However, occupational pensions are liable to the USC, if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold, which from 1 January 2015 is &euro;12,012 per annum. </p>  <p>  As you are aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available at www.finance.gov.ie. The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.  However, the Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.  In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions. </p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge. An estimated further 87,000 individuals have been exempted from the charge as a result of the further extension of the threshold to &euro;12,012 in Budget 2015. This latter extension equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level. Furthermore, I intend to continue to reform the tax system in this manner in future budgets, subject to having the required fiscal space.  I would point out however, that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that all those who paid Income Tax and /or USC in 2014, including pensioners, will see a reduction in their tax bill this year where income is equal.</p></reply>

I would point out that the two-thirds rule applies to a supply of services where the value of the goods included in the supply exceeds two thirds of the total price charged.  For example, where the cost to the hearing aid repairer of zero rated materials, which includes hearing aid batteries, used in the repair of the aid is &euro;120 exclusive of VAT and the total charge for the repair work is &euro;150 then the zero rate, which is the rate applicable to the materials, is the rate that applies to the total charge of &euro;150.  The reduced rate of VAT of 13.5% applies to hearing aid repair services where the materials used do not exceed two thirds of the total charge.</p></reply>

The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund the Jobs Initiative, will also end after this year.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  </p>  <p>  The pension fund stamp duty levies are charged on the trustees of pension schemes and others (including insurance companies) who have responsibility for the management of the assets of pension schemes or plans. It is up to the trustees of pension schemes, for example, to decide whether and how the impact of the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent. I have no detailed information on the decisions made by pension fund trustees or others in relation to the passing on of the full or a partial impact of the levy to the current, deferred or former (retired) members of pension schemes. I am aware, however, that where trustees have made the decision to pass on the impact or part of the impact of the levy to pensioners that a smaller reduction in pension payments over the lifetime of the pension may have been made in many cases in preference to a larger reduction over a shorter period.</p>  <p>  The question raises the issue of restoration of income. While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy collected as has been requested in the past. The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees etc) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the tax burden on those on low and middle incomes.</p></reply>

This is assessed in two ways.  Firstly, until the MTO is reached, a minimum annual improvement in the structural balance is required. The second assessment is compliance with the expenditure benchmark.</p>  <p>  Under this second pillar, public expenditure, in the absence of discretionary revenue measures, should grow in line with the potential growth rate of the economy, the latter estimated as an average over a ten-year horizon.  Furthermore, if a Member State is not at its MTO expenditure should grow at a rate that is sufficiently below the potential growth rate (allowing for a so-called 'convergence margin') in order to ensure rapid convergence towards the MTO.  The benchmark rate for expenditure growth is then calculated, taking into account projections for inflation in order to preserve the real value of expenditure. </p>  <p>  The applicable benchmark reference rate for Ireland in 2016 is 1.9%. The convergence margin for 2016 is 1.8%. Therefore applying this to the 2015 general government expenditure aggregate gives real growth of 0.1%. </p>  <p>  To adjust this for nominal terms, the GDP deflator is applied. This is the average of the European Commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts for 2016 for Ireland. While the former is available the latter will not be issued until November so the Department's forecast will have to be used in Budget 2016 calculations. In the Stability Programme Update in April 2015, my Department used a forecast of 1.5%. Using this and taking account of discretionary revenue measures primarily related to the indexation of the tax system and including carry forward from 2015 tax measures, the fiscal space was calculated to be &euro;1.2bn to &euro;1.5bn. </p>  <p>  The Government stated in the Spring Economic Statement that this fiscal space would be split evenly between revenue and expenditure measures.</p></reply>

The report cautioned that reliefs create costs which have to be paid for, either by taxpayers who do not benefit from the relief or by reductions in public expenditure. The report specifically recommended against providing reliefs for those who had paid stamp duty. The reasons given were that such relief would not be targeted on need, that the tax structure was known to house purchasers at the time of purchase, that the selling price of the property may have been affected by the stamp duty paid and that the stamp duty revenues would have been spent on the provision of public services.</p><p>While some individuals had a significant Stamp Duty liability, they may have been able to claim mortgage interest relief (MIR) on interest up to &euro;20,000 per annum; and individuals who bought properties between 2004 and the end of 2012 can continue to claim mortgage interest relief until 2017. Mortgages taken out since 31 December 2012 do not qualify for mortgage interest relief.  </p><p>A system of deferral arrangements is available where there is an inability to pay and certain specified conditions are met, whereby a person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax.

The intention is to prepare heads of a bill, bring these to Government and then commence pre-legislative scrutiny. I hope to reach the pre-legislative scrutiny stage by the end of this year. </p><p>As the primary purpose of the independent budget office is to assist opposition parties with costing of budgetary proposals, analysing the economic impact of budgetary packages and advising on the impact of the fiscal rules, it is likely and appropriate that the pre-legislative scrutiny should be a lengthy process. It is here that the campaign for equality budgeting and this proposal overlap. If there is demand or support for the equality impact of budgetary proposals and packages being put to the independent budget office to be considered, then it can be incorporated in the Bill.</p><p>I want to make it clear that budgetary proposals and legislation being put to the D&aacute;il by the Government will not be a matter for the new office.</p><p>Under the Constitution, budgetary allocation is a fundamental responsibility of the D&aacute;il and its individual members and the Government is responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. It follows that it is up to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to consider the Government's budgetary proposals and legislation and decide upon them. The extent to which it wants to take equality impacts into account is a matter for it to decide. However, Government's budgetary proposals are presented to the D&aacute;il first and this will continue to be the case.</p><p>Having said all of the above, I want to assure the Deputies that Government takes equality very seriously. This starts with the fact that Cabinet procedures require a whole range of impacts to be covered in every decision proposed to Government. This ensures that the impact of policy proposals on gender equality, rural communities, North-South/East-West Relations, employment, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion, people with disabilities and industry costs are taken into account.</p><p>The Department of Finance carries out distributional analyses of budgetary options using the Economic and Social Research Institute's (ESRI) Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes (SWITCH) model. For Budget 2015, the Department produced analysis of the distributional impact of tax measures. These are contained in the Tax Strategy Group papers and inform the budgetary decision process.  These papers are subsequently made public after the Budget and are available here .  Further distributional analyses are carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Social Protection including distributional analysis of Budget measures and social welfare changes. Indeed, for this year's budget, it is also planned that the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Social Protection will conduct a social impact assessment of the main tax and welfare measures contained in the final Budget package.</p><p>Finally, the Budget book contains illustrative examples of the impact of taxation changes on different income earners.  Overall, the analysis and transparency of the decision making process has been undergoing constant improvement over recent years and I would envisage this continuing.</p></reply>

It was introduced on that basis to help lower carbon emissions, reduce traffic congestion, encourage more employees to cycle to work and also to help improve health and fitness levels. However, as children tend to receive bicycles from their parents there is a concern that such an extension to the scheme would become a subsidy towards purchases which would happen anyway and would therefore drive up bicycle prices, as subsidies tend to do. In addition, any subsidy to the children of parents who are in employment could be seen as  discriminatory towards children whose parents do not work.</p>  <p>  Finally, as Minister for Finance I must be conscious that the introduction or expansion of any scheme creates a cost and that cost must be recovered elsewhere. It was estimated at the time of the introduction of the scheme that approximately 7,000 employees would avail of it over the first five-year period of its operation. However anecdotal evidence would suggest that the scheme has been considerably more successful than this. </p>  <p>  I am not in a position at this point, therefore, to consider extending the scheme as the Deputy suggests and I have no plans to do so.</p></reply>

The Government keeps under review various initiatives, which could help Ireland reap the full rewards of a digitally enabled society. There continues to be significant growth of the digital economy in Ireland, including in payments, for example there has been a 26% increase in active users of online banking from 2012 and 2014. The use of card payments is also increasing with debit card usage tripling over the last eight years. </p>  <p>  In forming policy in this area, including considering the implementation of a digital certification authority for cash transactions involving State bodies, the Government has to be cognisant of the changed technological and regulatory environment in which payments operate. While historically European payments were segmented into individual national payment systems, since 2014 we have become integrated in the Single Euro Payments Area. Developing national solutions in isolation is now neither always optimal nor, indeed, feasible. As such the work of the European Retail Payments Board in this area is monitored, this currently includes recommendations on technical standards related to payment cards to tackle fraud, as well as the investigation electronic invoicing solutions related to retail payments. My Department will monitor this work with a view to identifying those technologies and opportunities which can help promote the development of the digital economy in Ireland.</p></reply>

Initially it applied only to transport fuels, then to other liquid fuels such as kerosene, agricultural diesel and natural gas and lastly it was extended to solid fuels on a phased basis in 2013 and 2014.</p>  <p>  Coupled with the long lead in period to the implementation of carbon tax on solid fuels this Government has also provided, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, generous grants via Better Energy Homes and also provides home energy upgrades free of charge to vulnerable households via Better Energy Warmer Homes to reduce dependence on combustion of fossil fuels for home heating. In 2014 the Better Energy programme provided &euro;53m grant support towards &euro;118m energy upgrade works.</p>  <p>  Carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p>  <p>  All taxes are reviewed in the context of the annual Budget.</p></reply>

To provide a comprehensive appeals system for impacted account holders, which would enable them to appeal any aspect of the proposed redress and/or compensation offer made to them in so far as it related to their situation.</p>  <p>  At close of business on 12 September, of the 1,352 mortgage accounts included in the Mortgage Redress Programme, payments have been made to customers in respect of 814 accounts 60% of the total.  That number is continuing to grow and the bank will be engaging with customers who have not yet replied to the initial correspondence over the coming weeks to encourage them to do so.</p>  <p>  The issue of appeals is very important and with that in mind the bank has put in place a comprehensive appeals process comprising two separate appeal panels; one to deal with cases of loss of ownership or cases where legal action is or was previously undertaken by the bank and a second panel to deal with all other cases.</p>  <p>  These panels include representatives from the legal and accountancy professions, and people with strong credentials in consumer advocacy.</p>  <p>  The establishment of these panels recognises that it would be neither appropriate nor possible for the bank itself to have the final say on what should constitute, for example, an appropriate level of compensation for the impact which its failure has had on individual customers of the bank.  These panels will be able to examine representations made by impacted customers on any aspect of the redress programme including the amount of the compensation payment offered and whether or not that adequately compensates an impacted account holder in respect of any stress, disruption and hardship the failure may have caused.</p>  <p>  The appeals process has also been set up in such a way to ensure that even if customers immediately accept the bank's proposals to redress their account and the bank's proposed compensation, doing so will not restrict their ability in the months ahead to bring an appeal in relation to either one or both of these issues or indeed other issues to the appeal panels.  I believe this has significant benefits for impacted customers and strikes the correct balance between ensuring that they can get redress and compensation immediately without having to accept such redress or compensation in full and final settlement of the matter.</p>  <p>  The bank has also made it clear that regardless of whether an impacted account holder uses the appeal process or not, they may choose to bring the matter elsewhere for adjudication including to the Financial Services Ombudsman and / or to the Courts.  In such cases the bank has explicitly stated that it will not invoke any statutory limitation period (that might otherwise apply) for a period of 12 months from the date the account holder acknowledges receipt of the bank's correspondence on this issue.</p></reply>

The IBAN is the sole payment account identifier for electronic national, international and cross border credit transfers and direct debits within the Euro area.

It demonstrated that prices in the basket of goods and services covered by the Jobs Initiative had fallen relative to non-Jobs Initiative goods and services even after removing the effects of rising energy prices.</p>  <p>  The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey results from the CSO indicate that the current level of employment in the Accommodation and Food Services sector has increased by 22,300 (20%) since the introduction of the reduced 9% VAT rate. Over the same time period, employment in Construction has increased by 19,500 (17%).</p>  <p>  The estimated cost to the Exchequer of the reduced 9% VAT rate, since its introduction in 2011 to end 2014, is &euro;1,533 million.</p></reply>

AIB has previously indicated that as part of its restructuring plan to reduce costs and increase efficiencies, outsourcing of certain functions would be considered in consultation with unions and affected staff. I have been informed by AIB that there are no compulsory redundancies as a result of AIB's recent outsourcing activities and last month the staff in the affected areas voted in favour of the outsourcing arrangements. </p>  <p>  This strategy was agreed by the Board as part of the bank's IT transformation Programme in September 2013, which was designed with the objective of positioning the Bank's information technology  environment for resilient and uninterrupted delivery to facilitate digital banking, while in parallel, protecting production services and reducing costs to serve.</p>  <p>  The Bank has selected two Multinational specialist providers Wipro and Infosys to deliver the required service both of which are located in Ireland. Infosys has indicated that they will set up a 200-seat facility in Dublin to house the staff who will be transferring from AIB as well as any additional staff who will be appointed locally following recent agreements that Infosys has signed.

The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, will also end after this year.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard. The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.</p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy collected as requested in the question. The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees etc) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

Under section 216A, sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting of a room or rooms as residential accommodation in his or her home and from meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting, are exempt from income tax where they are below the annual limit for the tax year in question (&euro;12,000 for 2015) and certain other conditions are satisfied.</p><p>The purpose of the relief is to increase the supply of rental accommodation by incentivising homeowners to rent out rooms in their principal primary residences to individuals on a residential basis, that is where the individuals are effectively using the room(s) either on its own or in conjunction with other parts of the residence as their home. It is not, and never was intended to apply to income arising from the provision of guest accommodation to occasional visitors.</p><p>Under section 849 of the TCA 1997, all duties of tax are placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners. I am further advised by the Commissioners that, having regard to both the express policy intent of the legislation and the construction of section 216A, which refers to residential accommodation as opposed to guest accommodation, they have consistently taken the view that the relief does not apply in respect of income from the provision of accommodation to occasional visitors for short periods or where rooms are let for business use or guest accommodation. This position is clearly stated in Chapter 7.1.32 of Revenue's Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Corporation Tax Manual, which is available on<i></i>. The manual was updated in February 2015 to reflect the fact that I increased the annual limit for the relief from &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 for 2015. In that context, Revenue took the opportunity in the light of media comments, to emphasise that the exclusion of short term guest accommodation applies equally where such accommodation is provided through an online accommodation booking site such as Airbnb.</p><p>Any question relating to the charging of income tax is a matter for Revenue. In this regard, the Commissioners advise that property owners who receive income from the provision of occasional guest accommodation should make a return of their taxable profits to Revenue and pay the resultant income tax, if any, under self-assessment rules in the normal manner.</p><p>Finally, I should say that in relation to calls from a number of quarters to extend rent-a-room relief to income earned from the provision of short term guest accommodation to occasional visitors, I am mindful that acceding to such requests could lead to unfair competition in the guest accommodation sector generally, by placing B&amp;amp;B and guest house operators who provide accommodation in the course of a trade at an unfair disadvantage.</p></reply>

A person is defined as permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Regulations if they satisfy one of the following medical criteria outlined in Regulation 3 of S.I. 353 of 1994:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p><p>The organisation (details supplied) made an application in July 2015 to Revenue.

This is allowed under paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010. All goods supplied to other travellers are liable to Irish VAT at the appropriate rates.</p>  <p>  Not all retail outlets are allowed to operate the scheme.  This is subject to an application, vetting and approval process.  Revenue approval is only granted where there is a robust sales system in place to ensure the zero-rated sales to customers travelling outside the European Union are clearly identified. The approved retailer is required to retain evidence, such as the boarding pass and flight details, produced by passengers travelling to non-EU destinations and the approved retailer must retain this detail in electronic format for future examination by Revenue, if required.</p>  <p>  The single pricing structure mentioned by the Deputy has been brought to my attention previously. Under the single pricing structure all travellers pay the single price but approved retailers do not charge VAT on sales to identified non-EU travellers.  I would point out that the pricing structure in any business is a commercial decision for the business and not a Revenue matter. Revenue's focus is to ensure that approved retailers comply with their VAT obligations.</p>  <p>  I would point out that the information furnished to Revenue on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular activities to be separately identified. The amount of VAT collected in respect of airport based retailers cannot be identified in the overall yield of VAT.</p></reply>

The regulations will replace and, where appropriate, amend a number of requirements that currently exist in legislation and guidance. Additional requirements have also been included in the regulations, where necessary, to strengthen the regulatory framework.</p>  <p>  The regulations introduce a maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 which will ensure the protection of members' savings   and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members. In order to take account of the nature, scale and complexity of a credit union, the Central Bank, following consultation, is developing its application criteria to allow credit unions apply to the Central Bank to retain savings in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  The Registry of Credit Unions has informed me that it intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry of Credit Unions will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. The Registry of Credit Unions has also informed me that a communication on this matter will issue from the Registrar of Credit Unions in the coming days.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.</p>  <p>  While to date the Central Bank has not received any specific proposals regarding investment projects of a public nature, the Central Bank is willing to consider such proposals including the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate such proposals.</p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions has informed me that the Central Bank is currently carrying out a lending restriction review programme and has invited credit unions with lending restrictions to apply to have those restrictions reduced or lifted. The closing date for credit unions to apply is 30 September 2015. While applications are still being processed, of credit unions that have applied to date, 45% of those credit unions have had their lending restrictions lifted. In relation to longer term lending limits, credit unions will be able to apply to the Central Bank for an extension of these limits. Approval will be subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

There are, in all, three separate Group Thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer. These are:</p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000</b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150</b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075  </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>Where the value of an inheritance exceeds a beneficiary's tax-free Group Threshold, inheritance tax is charged at a flat rate of 33% on the amount of the excess.</p><p>There are two important dates that are relevant for the taxation of an inheritance. These dates are used for different purposes and are mutually exclusive. Firstly, the date of death of a disponer is the date by reference to which the Group Thresholds and tax rates are determined. Therefore, whatever thresholds and rates are in force on this date apply for the purpose of taxing the value of an inheritance. These rules are based on statute and are strictly applied. There is no provision for marginal relief in circumstances where, for example, a disponer dies within a short time of a change in the statutory thresholds and/or rates.</p><p>Secondly, the date on which probate or administration is granted is generally used as the 'valuation date'. This date has no effect whatever on the applicable Group Thresholds and tax rates. The valuation date is the date on which the market value of the assets/property comprising the inheritance is established. This market value is then compared to the relevant Group Threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold. This date also determines when any inheritance tax must be paid and a tax return must be submitted to Revenue.</p><p>Inheritance tax is a self-assessed tax and tax returns are processed on this basis. As with any other self-assessed tax, Revenue selects a number of cases for compliance checks and audit, generally basing the selection on its risk rules but also based on a certain amount of random selection.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a claim for capital gains tax relief may arise under section 538 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of losses incurred by the owners of milk quotas as a result of the abolition of those quotas earlier this year where they were purchased by the persons concerned. The allowable loss is the capital loss equivalent to the amount incurred by the person when the milk quota was acquired. However, the amount of the loss allowable is restricted to the extent that it has been covered by the amount of capital allowances or renewals allowances granted for income tax purposes. This restriction applies to quotas which were purchased on or after 1 April 2000. Claims for relief under section 538 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 should be made to the tax district dealing with the tax affairs of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  Where a claim for relief under section 538 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is allowed, the amount of the loss can be set off against chargeable gains made by a person in the year 2015 or in any subsequent year.</p>  <p>  Assuming that the Capital Gains Tax Allowance on milk quota referred to by the Deputy relates to the loss arising as a result of the abolition of milk quotas, there is no time limit within which the loss may be carried forward and set off against chargeable gains.</p></reply>

However, I do not have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals.</p><p>The provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the need to make adequate provisioning to meet these risks. As a matter of course, insurance companies carry out reviews of the risks against which they are prepared to insure and sometimes make decisions to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk. Insurance Ireland has indicated that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover.</p><p>Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  The Office of Public Works is carrying out an assessment of flood risk throughout the country under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme. This programme will include the  production of a comprehensive suite of flood risk maps and the development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk. The plans will consider the best possible options, both structural and non-structural, for dealing with the risks on a long-term basis.</p><p>This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016. Works are completed on a prioritised basis. Due to the cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, this approach will see benefits over the medium and long term.</p><p>The OPW and Insurance Ireland have agreed on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes. The outcome of this arrangement is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works. The industry will therefore be able to use this information when assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed.</p><p>The Deputy has raised the issue of flood insurance in Glanmire, County Cork. My officials are advised by the Office of Public Works that a flood relief scheme for the Glanmire area, known as the Glashaboy Flood Relief Scheme, is being developed by Cork County Council with funding from the Office of Public Works. This project is expected to be completed in 2017 at which time, data in relation to it will be shared with Insurance Ireland.</p><p>I would also note that the Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Coordination Group, at which my Department is represented, has been reconvened to take a Whole of Government approach that is necessary to support the Flood Risk Management Plans being prepared by the Office of Public Works. The role of this Committee is to co-ordinate recommendations of Government Departments to introduce effective sectoral supports and policy measures in their areas of responsibility with regard to flooding. The Group is tasked with compiling its report to Government by Spring 2016.</p><p>I am advised that in cases where individuals are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact the Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at<i></i>.</p></reply>

The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In this regard, the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the customer. Children's clothing and footwear are subject to the zero rate for children up to 11 years. Section 46(1)(b) Schedule: 2 Paragraph: 10(1) of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, clarifies the zero rate of VAT applied to children's clothes. The zero rating applies according to the following criteria:</p>  <p>  Clothing described, labelled, marked or marketed as being for children under 11 years of age up to &amp;amp; including chest size 32; waist size 26; height 152 cm or other equivalent sizes. Children's footwear up to and including size 5&frac12; (38 continental or equivalent).</p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As school uniforms for people over 11 years of age and children's footwear above size 5&frac12; were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to them now.</p>  <p>  In addition, Member States may apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. As clothes and shoes are not listed under this Annex the reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of school uniforms or shoes. Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of school uniforms for children over 11 years of age or children's footwear above size 5&frac12; (38 continental or equivalent) is the standard VAT rate of 23%.</p></reply>

The Bank has attributed the proposed increase to both a proliferation of legislative regulation/regulatory activity and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17 coupled with current low yields on the bond market.</p><p>There has been significant regulatory change since the economic crisis of 2008 in order to protect against future financial crises and also to protect consumers and taxpayers. Both the Central Bank and industry have responded to this new regulatory environment by increasing the level of resources devoted to regulatory and compliance matters. The Government priority is to ensure that the regulator is sufficiently resourced to fulfil its important role and staff costs (including pension costs) are a key component of this effective regulatory regime.</p><p>It is important to note that a robust regulatory environment benefits the financial services industry by promoting stability, a level playing field and facilitating prudent development and innovation. A well regulated financial services sector also benefits consumers, industry, and the economy at large. However, I have not yet made any decision under Sections 32D and 32E on the 2015 levies that will be applied by the Central Bank.</p><p>I am aware of the issues raised by the Professional Insurance Brokers' Association and the Irish Brokers' Association regarding the impact of any increase on their members and the linkage with the Central Bank pension scheme.

The public service covers the cost of pensions from current funds whereas the Central Bank funds pensions through a dedicated pension fund. As a consequence, the cost of the Bank's pension scheme is accounted for in accordance with the prevailing Financial Reporting Standards (FRS17 Retirement Benefits) which leads to higher pension charges in the current low bond yield environment. The Central Bank Superannuation Scheme fully satisfies the Pensions Authority's Funding Standard and has done so every year since it was established in 2008. It is also projected to satisfy the additional Funding Standard Reserve Requirement being introduced from 2016.</p></reply>

Article 91(3) CRD IV establishes limits to the number and nature of directorships for members of the management bodies of financial institutions that are considered significant in terms of their size, internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities.  The European Union (Capital Requirements) Regulations 2014 () transpose the provisions of CRD IV into  national law. Regulation 79(7) of those regulations provides that, from 1 July 2014, members of the management bodies of institutions designated as significant, must not hold directorships amounting to more than one of the following combinations: a) One executive directorship with two non-executive directorships; b) Four non-executive directorships.</p><p>Prior to these Regulations, the Government actively rotated the directors of the State owned financial institutions and also selected candidates with the abilities, experience and time to properly carry out their roles as non-executive directors of these institutions.</p><p>In terms of other financial institutions, I support the Central Bank's statutory Corporate Governance Code for Credit Institutions and Insurance Undertakings and Corporate Governance Code for Captive Insurance and Captive Reinsurance Undertakings that sets out the requirements in relation to the appointment of directors. For Credit Unions, the Credit Union Handbook contains governance expectations.</p><p>In addition, the Central Bank recently undertook a thematic review which examined directorships held by individuals on the boards of corporate investment funds, fund management companies and AIF management companies. The Central Bank subsequently published guidance to assist Chairs, boards and individual directors in assessing the time commitment required for individual directors to fulfil their roles. The Central Bank continues to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

The Revenue operational manual has clearly stated that income from the provision of accommodation to occasional visitors for short periods does not qualify, as visitors use the accommodation as guest accommodation rather than for residential purposes.

Internationally it has been replaced by Gross National Income (GNI) which is found by adjusting GNP for EU taxes and subsidies and is also the measure on which a large part of EU budget contributions are based. Currently on the Eurostat database, year 2014 data has only been reported by a handful of Member States but data is available for most in respect of year 2013.</p><p>National Debt is a presentation of the indebtedness of the Exchequer. It is calculated net of liquid assets and excludes certain liabilities recognised in the General Government Debt. There is no available set of data to compare measures on National Debt across the EU. The General Government Debt (GGD) is the standard measurement of gross indebtedness used for comparative purposes within the EU. It includes the debt of the Exchequer, the extra-budgetary funds, the non-commercial state-sponsored bodies, as well as the debt of local authorities.</p><p>Table 1 contains General Government Debt as a percentage of GNI for the EU area for years 2013 and 2014 (where available).</p><p>It should be noted that National Debt, General Government Debt and GNP projections for years to 2020 in Table 2 are consistent with the forecasts for Stability Programme Update published in April 2015.

This issue has been under observation for some time by my Department.  Indeed, the economic review and outlook that accompanied Budget 2015 contained a detailed explanation of the issue.  </p><p>().</p><p>Exports grew by 13.6 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of this year, with goods exports up over 16 per cent.  Part of the strong performance in goods exports can be attributed to what is known as 'contracted manufacturing'.  </p><p>This contracted production occurs when an Irish-resident (though not necessarily Irish-owned) enterprise contracts a plant abroad to produce a good for supply to a third country.  The sale of the good is recorded as an Irish export as the economic ownership of the good prior to sale is regarded as belonging to the Irish-resident enterprise.  Imports (for example patents and royalty fees) used in the production process are also recorded as Irish imports.</p><p>It is important to stress that the contribution of contracted production to overall exports cannot be calculated with precision with the publicly available data.  It is also important to note that this phenomenon involves very little employment effect or second-round impact on the wider economy.  In fact, the CSO confirmed that last year contract manufacturing had a negligible impact on GDP growth; this is because the phenomenon involves an increase in the level of both exports and imports, with little net impact.  </p><p>Notwithstanding these developments relating to contracted production, there is no doubt that the recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.  This is very important given the jobs and tax rich nature of domestic demand.</p></reply>

This is in line with the approach agreed by Member States in the Irish Presidency Roadmap in 2013.  </p>  <p>  While we have yet to see the exact details of the re-launched CCCTB proposal, and won't see them for some months, Ireland will engage constructively in these matters, as we always do, while holding a firm line that matters of direct taxation remain a member state competence and that unanimity in tax matters is maintained.</p></reply>

Up to end of August this year, some 44.1 million cigarettes have been seized. Notable seizures have included quantities of 7.68 million, 10.3 million and 9 million.  </p>  <p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade has been, and continues to be, a priority for Revenue.  Their actions include a range of measures to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved.  Their multifaceted strategy also includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics and deployment of technologies and optimising the deployment of resources.  </p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue's goal to intercept the supply of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue also target the illicit trade at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  </p>  <p>  Revenue co-operates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other tax administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to tackle the illicit trade.  </p>  <p>  The extent of the illegal trade in cigarettes is estimated through annual surveys of smokers that are carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI.  Assuming that the illegal cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantities of cigarettes, the results of these surveys indicate that the loss to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT in 2014 was of the order of &euro;210 million.  </p>  <p>  I have introduced a number of measures in recent years to assist Revenue in dealing with tobacco smuggling and illegal tobacco sales.  Measures in the Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excisable products.  </p>  <p>  In the Finance Act 2013, I introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit tobacco production, and provision for forfeiture of any equipment, materials, or unmanufactured tobacco used for illicit production.   </p>  <p>  In the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, I strengthened the obligation on a person suspected of dealing in unstamped tobacco products to provide information to a Revenue officer or a Garda and to present any tobacco products concerned for examination.  This measure also allows the officer or Garda to search any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for action by Revenue against the illegal tobacco trade.  I will consider any proposals for additional measures that are shown to be of assistance to Revenue in this area.</p></reply>

The focus of such banks is on the needs of residents and SMEs within their own geographic catchment area.  Local public banking could have the potential to complement Government policy in a range of areas such as improving competition in the banking market, augmenting competition and innovation in the SME finance market and regional development.    </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has to date delivered a number of initiatives that increase access to finance for SMEs such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.  </p>  <p>  The business model of local public banks is similar to that of the SBCI in that rather than focusing on profit maximisation, they seek to enhance the availability of finance to SMEs in their catchment areas.  It is encouraging to note that the most recently published lending figures for the SBCI show that 85% of lending to date has been to regionally based SMEs.  Other institutions operating in the Irish credit market such as credit unions are not profit maximising entities but have a key role to play in providing access to credit and other important services in local communities throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are considering proposals on local public banking and its potential for Ireland.  They have been considering how a local public banking concept, with a focus on supporting SMEs, could complement initiatives already in existence.  </p></reply>

The lower full year yield reflects that in a full year (compared to the first year) the cost of reducing the existing 11% surcharge for self-assessed cases to 10% weighs more heavily on the net yield.  </p>  <p>  These estimates assume that all existing USC rates and bands remain unchanged.  They are based on 2016 estimated incomes from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2013, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  They are provisional and may be revised.  </p>  <p>  The proposal suggests that the yield from the revised system is ring-fenced for social investment purposes, such as improving healthcare.  The yield from USC is estimated to be &euro;4.2 billion in 2015, and it is used to fund the State generally.  If it were to be ring-fenced, the expenditure currently financed by the yield from USC that is not social investment, as defined, would have to be financed by alternative means, which could require additional taxation.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I will bear the proposal in mind in the context of my preparations for the upcoming Budget.</p></reply>

No 147 of 2013) as having "significant pyritic damage".  </p>  <p>  The Regulations also specify the assessment methodology that must be applied to confirm the presence of significant pyritic damage, including that the Building Condition Assessment must be carried out by a qualified competent person (I.S. 398-1:2013).

This is the only type of certificate that is relevant under current legislation.   </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of LPT over 2,000 property owners have claimed exemption on foot of pyritic damage.  Of these, 76 cases have qualified for the exemption and Revenue has put a hold on collection in approximately 600 other cases to give the owners in question time to secure the required supporting documentation.  The remaining claims were either found to be ineligible following verification checks by Revenue or did not provide the required level of supporting documentation.  </p>  <p>  A review of the operation of LPT was recently submitted to me by Dr Don Thornhill and is currently being considered by my Department.  Any recommendations that are included in the review findings in regard to pyritic damage will be considered in the context of the upcoming Budget.

The timing of the sales is a matter for the Central Bank which may elect to sell bonds at a particular time if it feels that this is the best course of action, for example, in order to take advantage of favourable market conditions.  I should state clearly that the Central Bank of Ireland is independent in the exercise of its functions.</p><p>The issue of proceeds from the disposals and its impact on profit distribution is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland.  By law, the Central Bank can retain up to 20 per cent of its profits for the purpose of adding to its accounting reserves; any amount not retained is distributed to the Exchequer.

Marginal tax rates are important to consider because they influence individual decisions to work more or indeed to work at all.    </p>  <p>  Improving the growth-friendly nature of the tax system involves relying to a greater extent on taxes that are less harmful to growth including through shifting the burden from labour to other taxes.  Research published in a Department of Finance staff working paper has shown the potential gains to Ireland in terms of GDP and employment from revenue-neutral shifts from labour taxation to consumption and property taxes.  </p>  <p>  A fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation.  I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so.  The changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that all those who paid income tax and/or USC in 2014, including pensioners, will see a reduction in their tax bill for 2015 where incomes are unchanged.  </p>  <p>  Ireland already has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world, as shown by the OECD.  To preserve that progressivity, Budget 2015 also contained USC measures which have the effect of limiting the maximum benefit from this package of tax measures to approximately &euro;14 per week for any individual taxpayer, which means that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent as those with more modest incomes.</p>  <p>  I intend to continue to make it more attractive to return to work, to stay in work and to ensure that work rewards individuals adequately.  I plan to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners in future budgets, subject to having the required fiscal space.</p></reply>

A pilot project for a Standard Bank Account was run, which finished on 31 March 2013 after a 9-month pilot period.  A total of 205 accounts were opened during the pilot, which the Financial Inclusion Working Group felt was disappointing.  </p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on the pilot project noted a number of reasons for this, including the view of stakeholders that one of the key elements required as part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a Standard Bank Account is greater involvement by An Post and the credit unions. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently transposing the Payment Accounts Directive which requires that all consumers legally resident in the EU must have access to a payment account with basic features, regardless of their financial circumstances.  The Directive also allows Member States to make provision to promote financial inclusion of unbanked, vulnerable consumers.  The Directive must be transposed by September 2016.  </p>  <p>  My Department is carefully considering how to make progress on this issue, in light of the requirements of the Payment Accounts Directive and the experience of the Standard Bank Account pilot project.  My Department is working closely on the matter with other relevant Government departments.</p></reply>

This plan will set out the timescale for implementation of the proposed measures.</p></reply>

This means the occupational pension is paid on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State Pension.  In instances when the State Pension is not payable, a supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme to bring the pension up to the same amount as would be paid to a public servant whose pension is not integrated.  </p></reply>

In summary, when a member dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of up to one-half of the former member's pension is payable.  Dependent children are also entitled to a child's pension.  </p>  <p>  Changes in legislation following the introduction of civil partnerships in 2011 and the proposed legislation to allow for same sex marriages do not necessitate a scheme member revising their superannuation arrangements as these are automatically catered for under the existing Revised Scheme rules.  </p>  <p>  The original pre-1984 scheme did not allow for the payment of a spousal pension where the scheme member married or had children post retirement.  Thus, the scheme allowed a refund of contributions if the scheme member had not been married up to the point of retirement. </p>  <p>  In 1984, a Revised Scheme which extended eligibility for benefits to spouses of members who married or had children after retirement was introduced and membership was compulsory for all new appointees after that date.  Members of the original scheme, certain retirees and those who had not joined the original scheme were given the option of transferring to the Revised Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Revised Scheme allowed for payment of spousal pension where the marriage occurred post retirement.  Therefore scheme members do not have to make special arrangements to have their civil partner or same sex spouse made a beneficiary as it will happen automatically.  The Scheme did not contain the facility for repayment of contributions on retirement if the scheme member concerned did not have a spouse and would not therefore be in a position to avail of any benefit under the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  For members who remained in the Original Scheme there was an entitlement to claim a refund of contributions in the event that the member remained unmarried at the date of retirement.  Many members of the Scheme availed of this option and received a refund.  </p>  <p>  Across the entire public service approximately 30,000 staff who were not members and an unquantified number who had been members of the Original Scheme opted not to join the new Revised Scheme.  Their reasons for doing so were presumably varied, including not expecting to get married, being in a relationship with a separated person who was not then able to divorce or that it was personally more beneficial to them not to join the scheme.  For example, prior to 1981 women were not entitled to join the pension scheme and therefore did not pay any contributions.  Some of those may have decided that continuing that arrangement was better financially for them.  </p>  <p>  In recent years, some individuals have sought to reverse the decision they made at that point and have sought a new opt-in.  More specifically, a number of people have argued that they could not have envisaged that same-sex civil partnerships would be legalised in the state.  While I understand that the number of enquires in this area is relatively low, I do not have precise statistics to hand.  My Department's position has always been that if decisions freely made about pensions or other matters could be reversed at any time this would have grave consequences for public administration.  Where changes have been made to pension schemes, individuals have only been allowed to opt in to the new arrangements at the time of the introduction of the new scheme.  This approach is in line with that of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. I do not propose to make any changes in this regard.</p></reply>

Those proposals provide for the part-restoration of the PSPR pensions cuts in three stages effective from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  From 1 January 2018, all public service pensions in payment with pre-PSPR values of &euro;34,132 or less will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the PSPR "net" will, in general, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.</p>  <p>  The PSPR was introduced in 2011 through Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts, and its constitutional legitimacy is based on the presence of an overriding public interest, in this case the fiscal crisis, and because it is general in application, fair and proportionate.  I am legislatively required to review all aspects of the FEMPI measures annually and the announced changes in the application of PSPR up to January 2018 reflect the outcome of my most recent review in June 2015.  The cost of the announced changes is estimated at &euro;90m over the three years out to 2018 which can be accommodated within our ongoing budgetary constraints.  Following the implementation of the changes only some 25,000 higher level pensions will remain subject to PSPR out of an originally hit total of about 90,000 pensions.  I have no plans at this time to make any additional changes to the application of the PSPR.</p></reply>

When instructed to award TRR to an individual officer, PeoplePoint then carries out the appropriate calculations and informs the relevant salary section of the adjustment to the officer's salary.  </p><p>- PeoplePoint is not required to notify the Department of Social Protection that an officer has been awarded TRR.  </p><p>- When absent on sick leave for 6 days or more, officers who are Class A PRSI contributors are required to submit Social Welfare MC certificates directly to PeoplePoint who complete the administration of the absence record and forward the completed certificate to the Department of Social Protection.  </p><p>- As Illness Benefit is now taxable, the PeoplePoint process is that all Social Welfare MC1 forms are mandated to be paid to the employer, unless specifically instructed otherwise by the employing Department/Office.  This allows salary sections to apply any applicable tax before payment of the personal rate of Illness benefit to the employee.  </p><p>- Illness Benefit is a Department of Social Protection payment that is subject to eligibility criteria and restrictions.  PeoplePoint has no knowledge of any individual's Illness Benefit payment record or their eligibility for continued payment.  The Department of Social Protection has confirmed that under Data Protection policy, PeoplePoint has no entitlement to such information<b>. </b>The Department also confirmed that they do not require to be informed of each individual award of TRR.  </p><p>- In order to assist salary sections in the reconciliation and recoupment of Illness benefit as appropriate, PeoplePoint provides a weekly report to all organisations serviced by it with details of social welfare certificates forwarded to the Department of Social Protection in the previous working week.</p></reply>

The construction programme is expected to take up to 24 months to complete. </p>  <p>  The position with regard to the Bandon Flood Relief Scheme is that the second stage of a tender competition for a civil works contractor is underway with tender documentation to be issued to the short-listed candidates imminently. At the same time the Scheme will be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (PER) for formal Confirmation of the Scheme as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts. The Minister will be required to undertake an independent review of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to ensure that all legislative requirements have been complied with before the Scheme can be approved. It is hoped that the EIS review process should be completed by the Minister for PER in early 2016 which will allow the appointment of a works contractor at the same time.</p>  <p>  The Skibbereen Flood Relief Scheme has already been submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for Confirmation and is also subject to an independent review of the EIS. Cork County Council is the Contracting Authority for the Skibbereen Scheme and the Council has already undertaken a procurement process for a civil works contractor.  Approval for the contractor appointment by the OPW as the sponsoring and funding agent must await the formal Confirmation of the Scheme by the Minister. It is hoped that this process will be completed later this year or early 2016 which will allow the Scheme to be commenced. It is expected that both the Bandon and Skibbereen Schemes will take in the region of two years to complete.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to the provision of flood relief schemes for the people of Bandon, Skibbereen and Clonakilty and the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing these schemes in its financial profiles over the years 2015-2018.</p></reply>

The six studies in the current Programme will assess flood risk in 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) deemed to be at potentially significant risk and will produce detailed Flood Maps and Flood Risk Management Plans.  The Plans will set out specific measures to address the significant flood risk factors in a proactive and comprehensive way. Ballina is an AFA in the Western CFRAM Study. </p>  <p>  Draft flood maps have been produced for the AFAs in the Western CFRAM study area and thirty Public Consultation Day events took place during October and November 2014 on these maps. The study is now progressing to examining all options to reduce flood risk, including both structural and non-structural measures. A Public Consultation Day on preliminary options took place in Ballina on 24th June 2015. Following finalisation of the mapping and assessment of appropriate flood risk management options, the final output of this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans.     </p>  <p>  The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for future State investment in flood defences. The Flood Risk Management Plans will provide the information to estimate the associated costs to implement these measures. Regarding prioritisation, those schemes and measures offering the greatest benefit relative to cost will generally be given the highest priority. </p>  <p>  Further information on the Western CFRAM Study is available on the study website www.westcframstudy.ie.</p></reply>

In its latest published report in 2013, the NDA noted that in the Civil Service, the area of the public service for which I have direct responsibility, 4.4% of staff employed had disabilities.  In relation to other areas of the public service, each Minister is responsible for compliance with and reporting on the target set in the Disability Act 2005 for the employment of persons with disabilities in public bodies under his or her aegis. In my Expenditure Statement for 2015, I announced that there will be a targeted programme of recruitment into the civil service to address service needs and a shortfall in key skills.  This programme commenced in late 2014, is continuing in 2015 and includes a number of open competitions providing employment opportunities for qualified candidates.</p><p>As far as policy developments in this area are concerned, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities includes key actions as follows: commence a review of the Commission for Public Service Appointment's (CPSA) Code of Standards to ensure that they fully support the employment of people with disabilities in the public service; and that the establishment of special public service competitions for people with disabilities to meet identified shortfalls in public service employment targets, including where appropriate the provision of alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities, with work in that regard to be taken forward by the Department of Public Expenditure in consultation with the Public Appointments Service (PAS).</p><p>My Department will be commencing its engagement with PAS and the CPSA shortly on advancing these actions. </p><p>In the context of the implementation of the Strategy, it has been agreed in principle to increase the public service employment targets on a phased basis from 3% to 6%.  This decision requires the making of formal statutory instruments by individual Ministers under Section 47 of the Disability Act 2015. </p><p>Finally, a number of Departments and Offices in the Civil Service are participants in the Willing Able and Mentoring (WAM) Programme which is a graduate work experience programme aimed at persons with disabilities.  This programme was not subject to the moratorium.  Details of WAM can be found here: <i>.</i></p></reply>

In tandem with annual headcount targets set for each area of the public service under the Employment Control Framework, the moratorium was applied across the entire public service. As the Deputy will be aware, the two instruments  played a central role in helping to bring the cost base of the public service into line with the State's funding resources. </p><p>Exceptions to the moratorium, where they arose, were made on the basis of the specific requirements of the particular posts to be filled rather than, for example, the disability status of any applicant.  In addition, a number of Departments and Offices in the civil service are participants in the Willing Able and Mentoring (WAM) Programme which is a paid mentored work placement programme aimed at graduates with disabilities.

While the information that traders must provide about booking fees is subject to consumer protection legislation, the fees themselves are not regulated. Though I am aware of consumer dissatisfaction with these fees, the limited information available about booking fees for concerts and other events would suggest that the fees charged in Ireland are not out of line with those in other countries.      While booking fees are not regulated, the same is not true of payment fees. The European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013, which give effect to Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights, provide that the fees charged to consumers for the use of a given means of payment, such as a credit card, must not exceed the cost of that means of payment to the trader. A trader who contravenes this provision of the Regulations commits an offence. Enforcement of the Regulations is the responsibility of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and, for electronic communications and premium rate services, the Commission for Communications Regulation.</p>  <p>  Directive 2007/64/EC on Payment Services in the Internal Market gives Member States discretion to forbid or limit payment charges taking into account the need to encourage competition and the use of efficient payment instruments. Ireland, in common with 12 other Member States including Germany and the United Kingdom, did not implement this option. The proposal for a revised Directive published by the European Commission in 2013 provides for a ban on surcharges for payments made under the main consumer credit and debit card schemes. Questions about this proposal and the related, recently adopted Regulation (EU) 2015/751 on Interchange Fees for Card-Based Payment Transactions are a matter for the Minister for Finance.  </p></reply>

It provides for a new two-tier Workplace Relations structure comprising the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court to replace the current five bodies.    While a number of technical and operational provisions of the Act were commenced on 1st August, the majority of the provisions, including those related to the new structures, will be commenced on 1st October.     Under the WR Act, claims under the Redundancy Payments Act can be made to a Workplace Relations Commission Adjudicator in the first instance, with a right of appeal to the Labour Court.  </p>  <p>  The WR Act provides for a range of enhanced compliance measures, together with a more effective and streamlined system for the enforcement of awards from Workplace Relations Commission Adjudicators and/or the Labour Court via the District Court.</p>  <p>Section 43 of the Act   provides that where a complaint which has been upheld at first instance by an Adjudicator, and has not been appealed by either party, remains unimplemented after a period of 56 days, the complainant concerned, a trade union or excepted body acting on behalf of the complainant, or the WRC in certain circumstances, may apply to the District Court for an order directing the employer to carry out the decision in accordance with its terms. Section 45 makes similar provision in respect of Labour Court decisions which remain unimplemented after a period of 42 days.  </p>  <p>  Section 51 of the Act 2015 provides that it will be an offence for a party who is so directed by the District Court to pay compensation to a complainant but who fails to do so, except in circumstances where that respondent can demonstrate to the Court that his/her failure to pay the compensation was due to his/her inability to pay.  I consider that this new enforcement mechanism will prove to be a very effective deterrent to respondents in employment rights proceedings who fail to pay awards made by an employment rights body. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the new compliance and enforcement measures provided for in the Workplace Relations Act will result in more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law, including rights provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act.</p></reply>

There are 35 multinational companies based in the Midlands, employing 4,032 across the Region. The agency is actively pursuing investment opportunities in its main markets (US and Europe) as well as positioning the region for newer opportunities in growth markets (Asia Pacific) and emerging companies (smaller companies with high growth).   The IDA Ireland business and technology park in Portlaoise is a 16-hectare site with additional  land available for further FDI development. Its tenants include Aubren (an Enterprise Ireland client company) and Internal Results, which announced the expansion of its operation in July. On the park, there is the 17,092 sq. ft. Advance Office Building, which is partly occupied (3,400 sq. ft.) by Internal Results. IDA Ireland continuously reviews its property options, including potential land acquisitions and disposals in the Midlands Region.</p>  <p>  A digital marketing campaign is in place to market the Midlands Region for potential investors.  This is used overseas by IDA Ireland executives, to showcase potential locations within the Midlands Region including Portlaoise. The agency has regular engagement with the Chief Executive of Laois County Council to ensure that there is a continuous line of communication open and a mutually supportive approach taken, considering the role that Local Authorities now have for economic development.</p>  <p>  IDA continues to actively engage with existing clients in the region to support them in growing their business to retain jobs and expand their existing footprint in the region.</p></reply>

The current work programme of the CLRG specifically includes topics on receivership, examinership and winding up.     With regard to the situation referred to by the Deputy, the liquidation of OCS Operations Limited is currently in the hands of liquidators under the supervision of the High Court.  While the liquidation is at an early stage, the High Court was informed at the hearing on 6 July that the liquidators have identified a number of matters which they intend to investigate as part of the liquidation process.  It is only when all the facts and events leading up to the winding up of the company are known, and any potential legal challenges are raised, that an informed decision can be made on whether an amendment to Company Law should be made.  </p>  <p>  The liquidators have important duties under Company Law.  They include an obligation to provide within 6 months of their appointment a report on the conduct of directors to the Director of Corporate Enforcement; a requirement to make an application to the High Court for the restriction of directors unless the Director of Corporate Enforcement has relieved the liquidator of this requirement.</p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 introduced stronger provisions under which a related company may be required to contribute to the debts of a company being wound up (section 599) and the pooling of assets of related companies (section 600).  The effectiveness of these provisions remain to be tested and it would be inappropriate to comment on their application in any case before the courts.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Mayo increased their employment by 73 to total 3,286 full-time jobs in 2014.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices - or LEOs - are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for support to anyone wishing to start or expand a business, focussing on the micro-enterprise sector (10 employees or less).  The LEOs can provide information, advice and guidance on the range of State supports to enterprise and signpost customers to the appropriate contacts across the various agencies that provide them.  Further information can be found on the LEO website at <i>www.localenterprise.ie/mayo</i>.  In 2014, a total of 66 new full and part-time jobs were created in companies supported by the LEO Mayo, bringing the total number of employees in these companies to 1,060. </p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, WINNING Foreign Direct Investment 2015 - 2019, sets out challenging targets, including the creation of 80,000 direct jobs in 900 investment projects over the period, bringing total FDI employment to 209,000 by the end of the period.  Under the program, IDA is targeting a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each Region outside Dublin including the West Region.  IDA Ireland client companies in County Mayo increased their employment by 204 to total 3,932 jobs in 2014.  </p><p>In February, the Government announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional initiative which seeks to build on the existing strengths and assets of each region to maximise enterprise growth and job creation. This initiative will see Action Plans drawn up for eight regions, supported by a package of up to &euro;250 million in funding over the next five years. </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs West Region is currently being finalised and is expected to be published shortly. A key target in the Plan is to increase employment in the region by between 10 and 15% on 2014 employment levels in the period to 2020 and to ensure that the unemployment rate in the Region lies within 1% of the national average. </p><p>I am sure that the measures outlined in both the Action Plan for Jobs and the Regional Action Plans, together with other policies being pursued by the State agencies, will continue to support enterprise development and provide employment opportunities in County Mayo. In that context, the State agencies will continue to work closely with each other, and with local interests, to support an integrated approach to job creation in Ballinrobe.</p></reply>

The remit of this Group is to advise me on issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry. The primary aim of the group is ensure that the Irish fishing industry are fully prepared for, and engaged in, the practical implementation of the discards ban.  It is the fishing industry alone that will be directly impacted by the implementation of the landing obligation and it is the individual vessel operators who will have to abide by the new rules as they are phased in and who will ensure that the landing obligation is operated successfully. It&rsquo;s for that reason that the Discards Implementation Group, chaired by Dr Noel Cawley, is made up of fishing industry representatives and those who can provide expert advice such as the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.   </p>  <p>  Consequently, I do not consider it necessary to add any further representation to the group as all those who have a direct role in implementing the landing obligation, are already represented at the DIG. I have provided that other organisations are kept updated on the Group&rsquo;s deliberations to date and this will remain the case.   </p></reply>

The model instrument aims to help ease access to finance for farmers and other rural businesses. Member States and regions can adapt and use this model to set up financial instruments funded by their rural development programmes (RDPs) under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Financial instruments can take the form of loans, guarante e funds or equity investments. The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding. It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources for such instruments.  In our RDP, we have made a commitment to examining the potential for the use of financial instruments. However, the inclusion of financial instruments by way of a modification to the RDP is required by EU regulation to be based on an ex ante evaluation which must assess:</p>  <p>- The existence of a market failure;</p>  <p>- The potential for added value;</p>  <p>- The resources required to implement a proposed financial instrument; and</p>  <p>- The proposed strategic approach to financial instruments.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have asked my officials to engage with the European Commission, the EIB and other stakeholders in order to identify areas where financial instruments could be implemented to best strategic effect, and to explore the practical steps which are required in order to i mplement financial instruments. Any such financial instruments are required by EU regulation to be structured on a clear investment strategy which identifies real market failures and economic needs.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, my Department has been exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was established by the Government as a strategic SME funding company and includes the EIB as one of its funding partners.  Among its range of products is an &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loan&rsquo;, available for investment by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products. The features of these products compared with those currently on the market are lower interest rates, loan amounts up to &euro;5m and increased repayment flexibility.

To date the total spend on projects by AADF is &euro;476,083.  AADF was established to encourage the development of partnerships between the Irish agri-food sector and African countries in support of sustainable growth of local food industries, building markets for local produce and supporting mutual trade between Africa and Ireland.</p>  <p>  AADF was initially set up for a pilot period of two years, but the experience to date has been that it has taken some time for project proposals to be developed and submitted, given the complexities of carrying out business in different African countries and the time needed to develop local partnerships in Africa. In this context AADF&rsquo;s operation has been extended beyond the initial pilot period. AADF is currently considering a number of potential project proposals and is open to receive new proposals.  In addition to the provision of project funding, AADF has been successful in raising awareness amongst the Irish agri-food sector of potential opportunities available in Africa and has provided additional support to Irish companies seeking to establish markets in Africa in terms of development of local networks and the provision of advice on the business environments in specific African countries through the Irish embassy network in the region.</p>  <p>  I believe that AADF is playing a valuable role in facilitating closer links between the Irish agri-food sector and the development of sustainable agriculture in Africa. In conjunction with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade my Department is considering undertaking a review of AADF to assess its structure and focus into the future.</p></reply>

These include the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers on the supply side. The longer term perspectives remain very positive.  Having witnessed dairy market developments affecting milk and dairy commodity prices in Ireland and the EU, I presented a six-point plan offering possible solutions to the Commissioner and my EU ministerial colleagues earlier this month. These were presented on the basis of my belief that they were appropriate for consideration by the Council and as a response to the market issues that had developed. This list was not exhaustive and I sought to reach common ground with other Ministers regarding a suite of appropriate solutions.</p><p>I am pleased to note that the final decision at Council on the aid package, including the 100% in the case of the PSA scheme for SMP, took account of significant elements in Ireland&rsquo;s six point plan. I am satisfied that the improved PSA scheme for this product which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, can help stabilise this market. Other key elements of the Commission Aid proposal include an advance of 70% for next year&rsquo;s Single Farm Payment which will assist with cash flow difficulties. I also welcome the almost &euro;14 million in direct aid for Ireland, a new PSA scheme for cheese and an increase in funding for the promotion of dairy products. In conjunction with stakeholders, I <i>will now consider how best to utilise these funds to support Irish farmers.</i></p><p>I also made it clear that from my perspective, it will be necessary to give consideration at EU level to responses to volatility issues in the future such as more price transparency through the EU&rsquo;s Milk Market Observatory. I believe that further consideration needs to be given to the role that might be played by futures markets. The use of financial instruments specifically designed to take account of the cash flow impact of downward price cycles in commodity markets requires further examination also.</p><p>In addition to measures at EU level, I have also been proactive in other areas in terms of ensuring the right balance of measures are in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers will remain confident for the future. Among the Government&rsquo;s initiatives in this area are provisions allowing dairy and other farmers to use income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills. This also offers respite to the sector from a cash flow perspective. Furthermore, I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan. In addition, I have impressed upon the Irish banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.</p><p>Finally I decided to make a 3 year interest free instalment arrangement available to all those affected by superlevy this year This option has been availed of by approximately 3,700 producers and will be of assistance to farmers facing cash flow difficulties arising from super levy in the final year of the milk quota regime.</p></reply>

These were presented on the basis of my belief that they were appropriate for consideration by the Council and as a response to the market issues that had developed. This list was not exhaustive and I sought to reach common ground with other Ministers regarding a suite of appropriate solutions. Whilst welcoming the steps previously taken by the Commission, including extensions to the dates for Aids to Private Storage and Intervention, I noted that having regard to the acute downturn in global milk prices over the past several months, and the severe impact this is having on farm incomes, that a number of further steps were urgently required including:</p><p>i. Utilising the provisions of Article 219 of the CMO Regulation to <i>temporarily</i>increase the threshold prices, with particular reference to skimmed milk powder.</p><p>ii. Restoring the scheme providing Aids to Private Storage for cheese which was introduced by the Commission in September 2014 but discontinued shortly after. In addition I called for the existing aid rates in the PSA schemes for butter and SMP to be reviewed immediately.</p><p>iii. Increasing the EU budget for market supports in light of the fact that the assigned revenues deriving from super levies will be some &euro;400 million higher than originally foreseen in the draft budget for 2016.</p><p>iv. Using exceptional promotion measures to promote the consumption of dairy products on EU, but especially on 3<sup>rd</sup>country markets.</p><p>v. Increasing the advance of the Basic Payment and other elements of Direct Payments Scheme and from 16<sup>th</sup>October 2015 to 70%, to alleviate cash flow difficulties.</p><p>vi. I also called for the reopening of the scheme on Private Storage for Pigmeat which was closed in May of this year.</p><p>In the longer term, I also made it clear that from my perspective, it will be necessary to give consideration at EU level to responses to volatility issues in the future such as more price transparency through the EU&rsquo;s Milk Market Observatory, further consideration of the role that might be played by futures markets, and the use of financial instruments specifically designed to take account of the cash flow impact of downward price cycles in commodity markets.</p><p>I am pleased to note that of the final decision at Council on the aid package, including the 100% in the case of the PSA scheme for SMP took account of Ireland&rsquo;s six point plan.. Unfortunately a temporary top-up in the intervention price for SMP did not enjoy the support of all Ministers or the Commission. However the improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the reintroduction of PSA for cheese, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment, the provision of increased funding for promotion and the provision of almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers can go some way towards alleviating the worst effects of the current market downturn. </p></reply>

The remit of this Group is to advise me on issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry. The primary aim of the group is ensure that the Irish fishing industry are fully prepared for, and engaged in, the practical implementation of the discards ban. Under the reformed CFP, Member States with a direct management interest in a particular region may propose joint recommendations on fisheries management to the Commission. Prior to making any recommendation, those Member States <i>must</i>consult with the relevant Advisory Council.</p><p>The key policy decisions with regard to the landing obligation e.g. what species are covered and when - have been and will continue to be made in the Regional Groups of Member States. Under the new Common Fisheries Policy the Regional Group <i>must</i>consult with the Advisory Councils (which include environmental NGO&rsquo;s). In North Western Waters, a regional Group of Member States (Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Spain, France and Belgium) has submitted a joint recommendation on a Discards Plan for demersal species that will come into effect in 2016. Representatives of the relevant Advisory Council &ndash; the NWWAC (of which the Irish Seal Sanctuary is a member) &ndash; have been invited to and attended all meetings of this Group and their views fully taken into consideration.</p><p>Since the establishment of the Group I have asked that interested environmental NGO&rsquo;s are kept updated on its deliberations on a regular basis and this will of course continue. I do not consider it necessary that they become part of the DIG given its particular remit in terms of practical implementation. I consider that they have every opportunity to input into discussions and inform advice within the Advisory Councils.</p><p>Consequently, I do not consider it necessary that environmental non-governmental organisations, including the Irish Seal Sanctuary, which will not have any direct role in implementing the landing obligation, become part of the DIG. As I have said previously, I have provided that such organisations are kept updated on the Group&rsquo;s deliberations and this will remain the case.</p><p>I would be happy to consider carefully any information the Deputy may have regarding &ldquo;serious problems&rdquo; regarding the implementation of the landing obligation which currently applies to pelagic species only.</p></reply>

However, as the Deputy is aware Howth is also a very important tourist and leisure destination and my Department has to be conscious of balancing the various unique features that pertain in Howth.  Parking is permitted free of charge within the limits of the Howth Fishery Harbour Centre for visitors and users of the Harbour. The only requirement is that they comply with the traffic management markings and procedures.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that upgrading works to the car park, including lining of parking spaces, have taken place as part of the harbour&rsquo;s ongoing traffic management improvements. In 2015 I have allocated &euro;75,000 for the continuation of these improvements.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, having regard to Health &amp;amp; Safety reasons and in the interests of proper traffic management generally, consideration is being given to the introduction of a Fixed Payment of &euro;150 for parking offences within the Centre.</p>  <p>  While my officials liaise with An Garda Siochana, Fingal County Council and other stakeholders on an ongoing basis on matters pertaining to traffic management within and in the vicinity of Howth harbour, where there are safety concerns regarding traffic management and parking these should be brought to the attention of the Harbour Master in the first instance.</p></reply>

The matters have also been extensively examined by the Agriculture Appeals Committee and the Office of the Ombudsman and the decisions taken by this Department have all been upheld by the aforementioned offices.</p>  <p>  In relation to bovine tags I understand that a letter issued to the first named person on 9 October 2001 from the local District Veterinary Office (DVO) in Ennis informing him that he received 77 tags between 1999 and 2001 and that he had registered only 56 animals. He was also informed that he had to account for the 21 tags not used before he could order any more tags.</p>  <p>  The EU Single Payment Scheme which operated from 2005 to 2013 was determined on entitlements based on the average number of animals, and/or the average number of hectares in the case of Arable Aid, on which payments were made in the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002 multiplied by the 2002 rate divided by the average number of eligible hectares declared during the same reference period. In this regard, the first person named established 43.74 entitlements at &euro;168.55 net unit value, giving a total net value of &euro;7,598.51. The second person named established 31.27 entitlements at &euro;133.59 net unit value giving a total net value of &euro;4,177.36.</p>  <p>  In 2004 the holdings previously farmed separately by the first person named and by the second person named were amalgamated and consequently it was necessary to amalgamate the entitlements held by each party under the Single Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  These entitlements were then amalgamated in their joint account giving a revised total of 75.01 entitlements at &euro;171.73 net unit value with a total value of &euro;12,881.46 (This is inclusive of a net Dairy Premium allocation of &euro;1,331.72).</p>  <p>  In addition, an application was made to the National Reserve in 2005 under Category B which caters for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 &ndash; 2002. This application was in relation to investment in land and was successful. A total of 5.15 new entitlements at &euro;239.46 net unit value and a total net value of &euro;1,233.22 was allocated from the National Reserve.</p>  <p>  The persons named submitted applications to consolidate their entitlements in 2006 and again in 2009 so that in the latter year they held 49.15 entitlements with a unit value of &euro;269.41 and a total value of &euro;13,241.50.</p>  <p>  A reply to the representations that were forwarded to my office on 23 June 2015 will shortly issue.</p></reply>

Accordingly, since 1995 my Department my Department has provided funding to animal welfare bodies to assist with their work in caring for animals. These organisations provide much needed assistance to animals (and by extension the owners of animals) in their local communities including providing appropriate and necessary veterinary care to animals at subsidised rates.

Specifications applied to beef animals slaughtered in establishments, and the price paid for different categories of animal are a commercial matter.</p>  <p>  However certain retailers and third countries have a preference for beef derived from animals slaughtered before 30 months of age. I hope that, over time, it will be possible to increase the flexibilities in specifications for third country markets, but this is a matter for competent authorities in those countries and will depend on other factors including our OIE status at the time.</p>  <p>  In my role as Minister I have used the Beef Roundtable as a mechanism to bring producers and the meat industry together to discuss all of the strategic issues impacting on the sector, including as regards animal specifications. One of the outcomes from this process has been the development of Beef Production System Guidelines. These guidelines, which are being officially launched this week, consider 14 different beef production systems within the context of the various market specifications which apply.  These Guidelines should assist farmers in identifying the system best suited to each individual case and highlight management areas that may need to be further addressed.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department will continue to provide an array of supports to the sector, including through Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme, with an investment of some &euro;300 million in the Beef Data and Genomics Programme for beef farmers and a dedicated Knowledge Transfer Programme for beef farmers.</p></reply>

In addition, 1,005 cases are in the process of either ground verification visits or administrative validation. To date, 652 cases have been referred to the LPIS Appeals Committee for consideration.  My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) which underpins the direct payments.  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter.  In that letter, farmers are informed of the need to carefully examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all unfarmed land, ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.  There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate.  They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis.  These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers.</p>  <p>  In the letters which issue where ineligible areas have been identified, considerable detail regarding the issues and maps to advise of the particular over-claims, are provided, in addition to which farmers are also informed of the appeals process, should they disagree with my Department&rsquo;s findings. The appeals process I have introduced is both robust and comprehensive; in the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independently-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee.</p></reply>

My Department has been actively working with Teagasc to ease staffing difficulties in the organisation. We recently secured approval for Teagasc to proceed with four priority appointments in the advisory service including the appointment of a drystock advisor in West Cork.  <i>New arrangements for managing public service staff numbers are currently being finalised, and they will provide public bodies like Teagasc with greater discretion over staff</i><i>appointments.</i><i>It is expected that the arrangements will permit Teagasc to replace staff as they retire, but strictly within an overall pay framework.</i>Within the parameters of that over arching policy, the question of <i>allocatin</i><i>g additional resources to particular regions remains an operational matter for Teagasc.</i></p><p>Teagasc is also re-configuring the way in which it delivers advisory services.

The primary objective of such arrangements is to maintain the strong focus of Teagasc advisors on knowledge transfer activities while also providing a scheme - support service to farmers.</p></reply>

The status of the herd will remain suspended until such time as all laboratory examinations have been completed&rdquo;. These examinations can include culturing of the suspect samples.  In practice, it is not always necessary to proceed to the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; stage and, using figures from 2014, an histopathological examination in the laboratory was sufficient to confirm TB in 54.5% of lesions and the herdowner was informed that his herd remained restricted as required by the Directive. In 22.4% of submissions, histopathological evidence was sufficient to determine that the suspect lesion clearly was not a tuberculous granuloma or was due to something other than M.bovis and, in these cases, the restriction was lifted and the herd was de-restricted (normally with 3-weeks of the detection of the TB-suspect lesion). In less straightforward cases, accounting for about 23% of cases, where histopathology does not suffice to make a final determination of the TB-status, the samples must be cultured. However, M.bovis is a particularly fastidious and slow growing organism in the laboratory and it can take up to 10 weeks from the time of slaughter of the animal until final culture results are available in conformity with OIE requirements.</p>  <p>  My Department makes every effort to ensure that the culturing process in the laboratory is completed as expeditiously as possible in order to ensure that herds are not restricted for longer than necessary.</p></reply>

This would have an approximate value of &euro;2.1m.  This is a very encouraging start to this trade particularly given that the trade to date is confined to the market for intact cuts as we currently await approval to ex port beef intended for grinding.  It must be remembered that only two plants were eligible to export up to mid-May and June respectively.  There are now six plants approved to export and my understanding is that this momentum in exports will continue and grow right through to the end of 2015.  As with any new market it takes time to build reputational brand and a customer base and the real time to assess its value is when these are bedded down.  More importantly the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe this year means that US buyers are priced out of the market and Irish exporters are choosing to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent.  Exports to the UK are up 4,000t compared with the same period in 2014 which was already up 9,000t on 2013.  The fact that the rise this year also coincides with a reduced kill overall (back about 10% year on year) highlights further the strength of Irish beef exports in the UK.  This of course is helped by a strong sterling and weak euro.</p>  <p>  Overall, 2015 has been a very positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average to date 10% up on last year (&euro;4.07 compared to &euro;3.70) in 2013 (10% increase).  Prices last week are 13% up on the same week last year notwithstanding recent price decreases.  Ireland is currently at 104% of the EU 15 price and 107% of the EU 28 price.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the relevant authorities in the United Stated in order to agree on a protocol which would allow the export of beef intended for grinding from Ireland to the United States and some progress has been made towards this objective.  However, it would appear that the USDA will not make any decision on this issue until the audit currently being carried out on US-approved plants in Ireland by the Food Safety Inspection Service has been completed and the report finalised.</p></reply>

Its policy is to accommodate all students that require places. Interest in part- time and distance education courses (Green Cert) is exceptionally high, at present, due to the education requirements of the Young Farmers Scheme and the National Reserve. My Department approved the appointment of 20 temporary teachers in 2014 to cope with the demand. It enabled Teagasc to substantially increase Green Cert intake from a normal level of 500 annually to 1,500 enrolees, a threefold increase. A further 20 temporary teachers were approved in July 2015 facilitating an additional 1,000 places for the Green Cert this autumn. It brings the overall allocation of temporary teaching posts to date to 40.  My Department continues to work closely with Teagasc to explore available options to manage the demand for Green Cert places. The provision of courses and allocation of resources in particular locations remains an operational matter for Teagasc.</p></reply>

In this context, the cost of veterinary care is primarily a commercial matter between owners of animals and service providers. It is important that people acquiring animals ensure that they have the capacity to take appropriate care of them. While the cost of veterinary care would be factored in to animal ownership, I am aware that, occasionally, persons owning pet animals do not have the means to ensure their animals&rsquo; health and welfare. Accordingly, my Department has provided funding since 1995 to animal welfare bodies to assist with their work in caring for animals. These organisations provide much needed assistance to animals (and by extension the owners of animals) in their local communities including providing appropriate and necessary veterinary care to animals at subsidised rates. Funding amounting to &euro;1.867m was allocated in December 2015 to 142 animal welfare charities. Applications for 2015 are currently being processed by my officials and a decision on funding levels will be made in December.</p><p>I should also mention that, in the context of recently introduced dog microchipping legislation which makes it compulsory as of 1<sup>st</sup>September 2015 to microchip all dogs born after 1 June 2015 and which will apply to all dogs post 31 March 2016, I have made funding available to animal welfare charities to subsidise the cost of microchipping for any dog owner who finds it difficult to afford the full cost of complying with the legislation i.e. social welfare recipients, those on state pensions etc. Details of how to make an application for funding is available on my Departments website at .</p><p><i></i>The financial assistance provided by my Department to animal welfare bodies assists in reducing incidences of animal cruelty. Such incidents of animal cruelty are totally unacceptable in a civilised society and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and for dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation. The new Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides for increased levels of  penalties for offences of animal cruelty. The Act sends a clear message to all that cruelty and maliciousness to animals is unacceptable and I believe that the increased penalties provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to perpetrators of such actions. For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty on conviction is up but not exceeding &euro;250,000 with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment.</p><p>My Department continues to work very closely with animal welfare and farming organisations, local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to minimise incidences of animal cruelty and to provide for early intervention in cases of suspected animal neglect or cruelty. To enable the reporting of incidences of animal cruelty, my<b></b>Department continues to operate a network of regional offices throughout the country together with an Animal Welfare Helpline (lo call 076 1064408) and members of the public can report any instance where animal welfare may be compromised to the lo-call number or by email to .</p></reply>

The payments audited covered the period from 2008 to 2012 during which over &euro;9 billion was paid to farmers in Ireland under the Direct Payment Schemes. I have always been opposed to the imposition of flat-rate penalties and particularly so in this case. I strongly refuted the application of this proposed correction as disproportionate to the true level of risk involved and my Department accordingly sought a hearing with the Conciliation Body.  Further to the Conciliation hearing in December 2014 the report of the Conciliation Body concluded that conciliation seemed within reach and that the Commission and my Department should continue discussing the matter with a view to an agreed settlement. On foot of this advice my Department maintained regular contact with the Commission, and carried out additional requested verification work, with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion.</p><p>The Commission Audit services carried out a verification visit to Ireland in May 2015 and further to same advised my Department in July of their intention to exclude a total of approximately &euro;67.6 million from EU<b></b>funding of various agricultural Direct Payment schemes for the seven year period from 2008 to 2014. This represents 0.7% of the &euro;12 billion in EU funding for these schemes in this seven year period.  This proposal means that the complete period of the Single Payment Scheme will have the Clearance of Accounts procedure concluded.</p><p>The proposal consists of two elements - &euro;64 million exclusion for the period 2008 &ndash; 2012 and &euro;3.6 million for the period 2013 &ndash; 2014. It must be noted that there is a decrease of almost 86% in the average annual level of correction for the 2013 &ndash; 2014 period relative to the correction for the 2008 &ndash; 2014 period. This clearly illustrates the very positive impact of the 2013 LPIS review carried out by my Department.</p><p>As can be seen, these outcomes have come further to a prolonged process of intensive communication and effort by my Department and the significant reduction from the original proposal of &euro;181 million reflects on same and the very detailed case presented to the Commission in strong opposition to the original proposal, including the examination of over 900,000 land parcels throughout the country.</p><p>It is noted that the proposed correction of &euro;67.6 million relates mainly to Commission findings in relation to the exclusion of ineligible lands from payments to farmers under EU funded schemes. I would, therefore, highlight that there is an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. I would urge them to ensure that all ineligible areas and land that they are no longer farming is excluded from the areas claimed for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes.</p></reply>

These companies have already proven their capability on international markets and I am confident they will continue to do so.  Planning in terms of marketing activities for the post quota period has been ongoing for a number of years. Developing a unique selling point for Irish dairy produce is a critically important element of the national strategy . It remains clearly evident, from engagement with potential customers for Irish dairy products, that the sustainability message associated with the sector in Ireland has a strong resonance. This is borne out in trade statistics that show substantial year on year increases in Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector exports from the turn of the decade. Data for the first six months of 2015 indicate that the overall level for dairy exports, at &euro;1.9 billion approx, remains consistent with the same period for 2014, a record year.</p>  <p>  As a support to this effort, in 2012 I announced a proposal for a new national sustainability programme for the dairy sector. This programme, the Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme (SDAS) was launched in December 2013 and is a key element in Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for marketing and promotion of dairy products on international markets, particularly in the context of expanded milk output following the abolition of milk quotas in April of this year.</p>  <p>  The Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme was developed in cooperation with milk producers, processors and regulatory authorities. It has been designed to provide a platform for measuring quality and sustainability on Irish dairy farms and to assist in securing new and existing markets for Irish dairy produce as farmers look to increase milk production in a post quota era.</p>  <p>  To promote the SDAS to customers of Irish dairy, the industry provides a promotional fund to Bord Bia and this will be focussed across 3 primary target regions, namely Europe, China and the Middle East at a business to business level. It is worth noting that exports to China in the dairy sector were up 25% approx compared to the first 6 months of 2014, which was a record year. Exports to Saudi Arabia, the predominant market in the Gulf, was up 48% in the same period.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia also has a central budget from Government which is used, inter alia, for the promotional activities in relation to dairy through attendance at trade fairs, market research in developing markets and consumer research. This funding has increased by 14% in 2015, and includes funding for Bord Bia to assist in the marketing of Irish food and drink including dairy at this year&rsquo;s Expo in Milan. I have also led Trade Missions to a variety of destinations in recent years, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish Food and Beverages and dairy promotion has been a significant feature of such missions. I intend to lead missions to China, Vietnam and Africa in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Taken together, I am satisfied that the foregoing measures as outlined reflect the strong ongoing commitment to making resources available to ensure developing and exciting markets in the dairy sector can be appropriately pursued.</p></reply>

Once these issues are resolved, further administrative checks must take place before payment can issue. Any outstanding payments will then be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year.    Rules regarding the advance notification of inspections are clearly laid down in the governing EU regulations and must be adhered to by officials in my Department. The regulations allow the Department to give notice for land eligibility and cross-compliance inspections involving SMRs other than those related to food, feed and animal welfare. However this notice must be strictly limited to the minimum time period necessary and shall not exceed 14 days. For checks involving cattle and sheep identification and registration the maximum advance notice is 48 hours. For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare no advance notice may be given and these inspections must take place on an unannounced basis. Where it is considered that the purpose or effectiveness of any type of inspection may be jeopardised by giving notice, the inspection will take place on an unannounced basis. </p>  <p>  Where extenuating circumstances apply at commencement of the inspection process, officials in my Department will examine the issue of proceeding with the inspection on the day, on a case-by-case basis, taking all of the circumstances outlined into consideration. </p></reply>

However I have on-going contact with Minister Noonan to ensure that taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture, as evidenced by our co-operation on the &lsquo;Agri-taxation Review&rsquo;, which was published as part of Budget 2015. The Agri-taxation Review is a comprehensive taxation strategy for the sector and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture was evidenced by the immediate implementation of the majority of its recommendations, including two recommendations aimed at addressing income volatility: </p><p>- retaining and enhancing Income Averaging by increasing the averaging period from 3 to 5 years; thus giving more scope for income smoothing within a commodity price cycle; </p><p>- allowing averaging to be availed of where a farmer and/or their spouse receive income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession.</p><p>Income averaging allows a smoothing of the tax liability in any given year to balance out the income effects of fluctuations in commodity prices that occur from year to year. </p><p>However, taxation measures alone will not deal with the issue of income volatility.</p><p>I believe that moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced, is a key insulation against volatility. More efficient and sustainable production systems are also important to improving profitability. The new Food Wise strategy, launched in July, contains detailed recommendations aimed at improving value added and productivity at all stages of the food supply chain. </p><p>The measures in the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme will provide vital support through farm investment, agri-environment and knowledge transfer schemes.</p><p>Direct payments to dairy farmers, estimated by Teagasc at about &euro;20,000 per farm, provide a source of income which is particularly important in challenging years. </p><p>The package introduced by the EU Commission last week to address difficulties in the dairy and pigmeat sectors reflects the majority of the demands I presented to them, particularly:</p><p>- The increase of more than 100% in the rate of private storage aid for skimmed milk powder.</p><p>- The award of almost &euro;14 million in direct aid to Ireland.</p><p>- The concession made by the Commission to allow advance payments of 70% under the direct payments scheme and 85% for rural development schemes before completion of controls, which will be of major benefit in easing the cash flow of farmers.</p><p>I have regular meetings with the CEOs of the main banks, and I know that all are aware of the difficulties in dairy prices this year, and are planning accordingly in terms of managing dairy loans. The dairy sector is resilient, and banks will have to step up to the plate to assist farmers over what will be a temporary trough in prices. </p><p>A key issue that warrants examination, particularly between producers and processors, is whether there is even further scope for longer term fixed price supply contracts for a proportion of farmers&rsquo; production and whether such contracts can be backed up by longer term supply arrangements with the buyers of Irish raw materials and ingredients.</p><p>Finally and importantly, in terms of super-levy impacts I recognised the difficulty that this caused for farmers here and took the decision to make the 3-year interest free instalment arrangement available to all those affected. This option has been availed of by approximately 3,700 producers and will be of assistance to farmers facing cash flow difficulties arising from super levy in the final year of the milk quota regime. </p></reply>

This is known as the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) which currently records, electronically, some 1.3 million individual parcels and which is required to be kept updated, based in particular on individual claims submitted from farmers and the results of inspection activity carried out by my Department for verification purposes. Because of the database&rsquo;s highly specialist nature, it has been necessary, since the inception of area based direct payments which have and will continue to be critical to the development of the Irish agriculture and food industries, to engage an external contractor to assist in this process. The Department&rsquo;s systems in this critical area must meet demanding EU and national audit requirements.  The LPIS is updated by two companies contracted to carry out updates based on maps submitted annually by applicants under the Basic Payment Scheme, land eligibility inspections and various reviews carried out by my Department. The contracts were awarded to the Mallon Technology Ltd and the ICON Group Ltd on the basis of a competitive tendering process in accordance with standard EU Public Procurement Procedures. These contracts are in place for a period of three years and commenced in 2013.   </p>  <p>  Over 80% of land eligibility inspections, which are required to be at the level of 5% of all applicants, are carried out using satellite imagery.

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year.  Each year a minimum of 5% of beneficiaries, under the various area related schemes have to be selected for a land eligibility inspection. These inspections can be carried out either by remote sensing using satellite imagery or classical ground inspections. In either case a report form is completed as required in the regulation. In the case of classical ground inspections a control report is provided to the applicant where non compliance is found. Where the inspection was carried out by remote sensing the applicant is notified of the outcome of the inspection where non compliance is found. Where compliance is found there is no need or requirement to give the applicant a copy of the control report.   </p>  <p>  In the course of maintaining the Land Parcel Identification System the Department is required to carry out regular checks to ensure that the system is up to date. These checks can result in field verification checks. The reports of such checks do not have to be provided to the beneficiary. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive appeal mechanism is in place for all schemes where an applicant who is dissatisfied with the outcome of an inspection can initially seek a review internally within the Department and subsequently has the option to appeal a review decision to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office. </p></reply>

These were presented on the basis of my belief that they were appropriate for consideration by the Council and the as a response to the market issues that had developed. This list was not exhaustive and I sought to reach common ground with other Ministers regarding a suite of appropriate solutions.</p><p>Whilst welcoming the steps previously taken by the Commission, including extensions to the dates for Aids to Private Storage and Intervention, I noted that having regard to the acute downturn in global milk prices over the past several months, and the severe impact this is having on farm incomes, that a number of further steps were urgently required including:</p><p>i. Utilising the provisions of Article 219 of the CMO Regulation to <i>temporarily</i>increase the threshold prices, with particular reference to skimmed milk powder.</p><p>ii. Restoring the scheme providing Aids to Private Storage for cheese which was introduced by the Commission in September 2014 but discontinued shortly after. In addition I called for the existing aid rates in the PSA schemes for butter and SMP to be reviewed immediately.</p><p>iii. Increasing the EU budget for market supports in light of the fact that the assigned revenues deriving from super levies will be some &euro;400 million higher than originally foreseen in the draft budget for 2016.</p><p>iv. Using exceptional promotion measures to promote the consumption of dairy products on EU, but especially on 3<sup>rd</sup>country markets.</p><p>v. Increasing the advance of the Basic Payment and other elements of Direct Payments Scheme and from 16<sup>th</sup>October 2015 to 70%, to alleviate cash flow difficulties.</p><p>vi. I also called for the reopening of the scheme on Private Storage for Pigmeat which was closed in May of this year.</p><p>In the longer term, I also made it clear that from my perspective, it will be necessary to give consideration at EU level to responses to volatility issues in the future such as more price transparency through the EU&rsquo;s Milk Market Observatory, further consideration of the role that might be played by futures markets, and the use of financial instruments specifically designed to take account of the cash flow impact of downward price cycles in commodity markets. </p><p>I am pleased to note that of the final decision at Council on the aid package, including the 100% in the case of the PSA scheme for SMP, took account of Ireland&rsquo;s six point plan.. Unfortunately a temporary top-up in the intervention price for SMP did not enjoy the support of all Ministers or the Commission. However the improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the re introduction of PSA for cheese, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment, the provision of increased funding for promotion and the provision of almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers can go some way towards alleviating the worst effects of the current market downturn.</p></reply>

In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery. My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers. Having said that, Irish prices have been on par with the EU average for 2015. However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.</p><p>Earlier this year I called on the European Commission to monitor the developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and/or private storage aid. This resulted in the introduction of the Aids to Private Storage scheme for the pigmeat sector which opened in early March of this year. However due to the fact that EU pigmeat market prices stabilised somewhat over recent weeks and the uptake of the scheme by operators dropped to minimal volumes, the Commission closed the scheme as of the end of April. </p><p>In the run-up to the recent Council of Ministers&rsquo; meeting, I put forward specific measures for the pigmeat sector as part of my six-point plan. Key amongst these was the re-introduction of the APS scheme for pigmeat. I am pleased to say that the Commission agreed to introduce such a scheme and will be coming forward with such a proposal in the coming weeks, which will include support for storage of fresh lard for the first time, I am confident that these improved aid rates and conditions can help to bring the markets back into balance. I also called for additional measures to promote the consumption of pigmeat on international markets and the EU Commission package includes enhanced promotion measures for pigmeat. </p><p>In relation to the<b></b>Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market. My Department has met with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions to impress upon them the importance we attach to the normalisation of trade with Russia. I have also called on the EU Commission to re-engage with Russia with a view to re-opening that market to pigmeat products that are not subject to the Presidential Decree. Last week the EU Commission agreed to resume these discussions with Russia. </p><p>Support continues to be provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors. Some &euro;37 million has been allocated for 2015.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers. Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector. </p><p>Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. </p><p>I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets. </p><p>For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market last year. In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports. My Department will continue in its efforts to develop access to international markets.</p></reply>

While acknowledging that these two men, along with the rest of the ship&rsquo;s company, performed effectively in extinguishing the fire on the L&Eacute; Cl&iacute;ona in 1962, there is no scope within the context of the provisions of Defence Force Regulations for further action with regard to the possible award of the Distinguished Service Medal. Furthermore, I have no plans to amend the Defence Force Regulations A9 (New Series) in this regard.</p></reply>

Disputes regarding parental leave may be referred for adjudication to the Workplace Relations Commission by either the employee or employer within 6 months of the dispute arising.</p>  <p>  While I would encourage employers to be as accommodating as possible in granting parental leave to suit the needs of individual parents, I recognise that regard also must be had to the business needs of organisations including seasonal variations in work volumes and the absences of other employees at the same time - particularly during the summer months. I am satisfied the current regime provides considerable flexibility in that regard together with the possibility to involve the Workplace Relations Commission where disputes arise.</p></reply>

Unfortunately up to 52% of applications lodged are not correct at the date of lodgement.  I am informed the PRA has engaged extensively with stakeholders to remedy this and has also introduced appropriate technological solutions to reduce these numbers, with some success.</p><p>Where there are delays and a case is urgent and this is brought to the attention of the PRA, the matter is dealt with expeditiously in accordance with the Authority's customer service policy. The length of time taken to complete an application for registration varies depending on a number of factors. These include the nature of the application, the complexity of the case, whether the application requires investigation of title and the completeness of the documentation presented. However when an application is lodged with no defect the turnaround times for different application types are as set out below:<blockquote>(a) All electronic applications (eDischarges of mortgages and eNursing Home charges) are completed within 2 days<b>;</b><br /><br /><b></b>(b) 75% of mainstream applications not requiring changes to the map, which are in order for registration, are completed within 10 working days;<br /><br />(c) 91% of Copy Folio and Title Plan applications, received electronically, are issued within 24 hours of receipt of application;<br /><br />(d) 94% of Official Map Searches are completed within 5 days.</blockquote>Applications for first registration, which are governed by a complex area of land law and has traditionally required the input of legally qualified staff, have more than tripled since 2010 from 4,139 in 2010 to 11,291 in 2014. The projected figure for end 2015 is approximately 14,000. Completion of such cases has also tripled from 3,109 in 2010 to 9,176 in 2014. The projected figure for completions of such cases in 2015 is 12,276. The outputs this year are up 76% on last year which has largely been achieved through re-engineering business processes and has resulted in over 60% of such cases being processed to completion within 4-6 weeks.</p><p>Of the remaining cases requiring investigation of title, the majority of these are not suitable for certification by a solicitor. Projected output for 2015 is 3,477 which is an increase of 76% over 2011 figures. These cases require a high level of case management and there can be delays of up to 2 years in the processing of some cases requiring a full investigation of title, but cases are dealt with on an expedited basis as required. </p><p>An agreement was reached in March 2015, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), to allow for the processing of these cases by a wider range of officers. I am informed that this issue continues to be allocated the highest priority in the PRA and measures are being put in place to bring about the changes facilitated by the LRC which will, over time, lead to further improvements in the timelines for such casework. </p><p>The table below set out  the number of staff in the Property Registration Authority in the years 2010 to 2014 and for 2015 to date:<table><tr><th>2015 (to date)</th><th>2014</th><th>2013</th><th>2012</th><th>2011</th><th>2010</th></tr><tr><td>491</td><td>503</td><td>525</td><td>555</td><td>583</td><td>601</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is important that we all respect the independence of bodies such as GSOC.  </p>  <p>  The power given to the Minister to refer a case to GSOC in accordance with Section 102 of the 2005 Act, as amended, does not confer a power on me in determining how GSOC carry out their investigation or the outcome.  Once GSOC has received a complaint it is a mater for them alone to carry out any investigation and arrive at their conclusion.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there is a mechanism in the 2005 Act to inquire into the conduct of GSOC designated officers.Mr Justice Frank Clarke of the Supreme Court is carrying out such an inquiry. I do not propose to comment further on this particular matter at this stage.</p>  <p>  Where a person is dissatisfied with the outcome of an investigation devolved to the Garda Commissioner under section 94 of the Act that person may request the Commission to review the investigation.  In all other respects where a person is unhappy with the findings of the Commission they must take it up with the Commission itself.  If they remain dissatisfied it would be necessary for them to seek independent legal advice.</p></reply>

Where cases are not dealt with within 3 - 6 months, in many instances this is due to either one party or both parties seeking adjournments.

A further 150 recruits will enter college by year end, bringing total recruitment of Garda Trainees to 550.

The work  of these 560 Garda&iacute; is supported by 80 Garda Reserve members and 47 civilian staff. The work of local Garda&iacute; in Louth and Meath is augmented when necessary by a number of Garda national units such as the the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).

The process of the Independent Review has not been to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation designed to make findings.

In each case a submission will be prepared. Mr Justice Roderick Murphy will review the summary of the conclusion and the letter of notification drafted to ensure that they are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendation.</p>  <p>  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June.  Letters will continue to issue to all complainants until the process is completed.  To date, notification letters have issued to approximately 120 complainants.  In each case the notification letter sets out counsel&rsquo;s summary of the issues, counsel&rsquo;s recommendations and the matters taken into account by counsel in arriving at this view (including such matters as the statutory independence of various bodies with whose decisions I, as Minister, cannot interfere).</p>  <p>  I have accepted counsels&rsquo; recommendations in all cases considered.  In 15 cases to date, I have taken further action in accordance with provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  In 6 cases, I have sought a report from the Garda Commissioner (pursuant to section 41(2) of the Act). In a further 9 cases, I have requested the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to investigate complaints (pursuant to section 102(5) of the Act). In addition, a further 3 cases, although I have not taken any further formal action, I have requested the Garda Commissioner to communicate with the complainant and where appropriate to appoint a liaison officer.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to ensure its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available in respect of an individual is taken into account.  In respect of cases such as that which the Deputy raises the current procedures for vetting are designed to ensure the integrity of the system.  Once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure must be revised to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  The general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service.  Such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.</p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.</p>  <p>  The current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.  However, in some individual cases additional enquiries may be necessary and this may result in processing times in excess of the average.</p></reply>

I have received the recommendations of counsel in all of the 320 cases which were referred to the Independent Review Mechanism and I am in the process of issuing notification letters to the complainants in all 320 cases.</p>  <p>  I should remind the Deputy that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act 2015 provided for the broadening of the scope for me as Minister to request GSOC to investigate any matter that gives rise to a concern that a member of the Garda has committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings. </p>  <p>  In this particular case a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was charged with assault in relation to the incident.

Garda&iacute; aim to be courteous, helpful, respectful and professional and to respond to the needs of victims in a caring and sensitive manner. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have recently taken a range of measures which will improve the experience of people reporting crime. These include the establishment of 28 Garda Victim Service Offices in each Garda Division to provide advice, information and support to victims. The offices are staffed by dedicated, specially trained personnel who will keep victims informed of all significant developments in their case. In addition a new Garda National Protective Services Bureau has been established, led by a Chief Superintendent.</p><p>Garda&iacute; engage closely with many community groups and fora as part of their commitment to community policing and this includes encouragement to help support people who may feel reluctant to report a crime. In addition, the Garda confidential line, 1800 666 111, provides a ready means of communicating information to the Garda&iacute; anonymously. </p><p>My Department funds 50 organisations who provide support and assistance to victims of crime. These organisations are willing to assist victims who suffer intimidation and to encourage them to report any crime which has been committed against them to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>In July I published draft legislation &ndash; the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill <b>&ndash; </b>that will put victims at the heart of the Justice system. Under the Bill a victim of a crime will have a wide range of rights. These include provision for a victim to be accompanied by a person of their choice when making a complaint to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, unless the member taking the complaint reasonably believes that the presence of that person would hinder the taking of the complaint or could prejudice the investigation or the criminal proceedings or would not be in the best interests of the victim.</p><p>I am also progressing legislation in the area of domestic violence which will improve the protections available to victims. Amongst the measures in the draft legislation is the right to be accompanied to court by a family member or friend, the ability to give evidence by televisual link so as to reduce the risk of intimidation and a limit on those entitled to attend Court proceedings.</p></reply>

Nominations are generally received from public representatives.  A local Garda Superintendent sometimes requests an appointment in a particular area in the public interest. </p><p>There is no qualifying examination involved but appointees are required to be of good character and they are usually well established in the local community. Persons convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable for appointment. Persons who are members of professions or employed in occupations which engage in legal work or related activities and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because of their occupation and civil servants are usually only appointed where the performance of their official duties requires an appointment (i.e. <i>ex officio</i>).</p><p>Finally, I can confirm that a background check on nominees is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The Committee agreed that my Department should prepare a report for the Cabinet Committee, in conjunction with relevant Departments, on the legal financial and practical implications of the Report's recommendations.</p>  <p>  Each Department is currently examining the recommendations to determine timescales for implementation and any impacts and issues that may arise.  My Department will be working with Departments on an overall response in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee also decided that the Minister of State for New Communities, Culture and Equality convene a Taskforce, as recommended in the Report, to examine the mechanisms and supports for the transitioning of persons granted status from the Direct Provision system.  The Taskforce has met on a number of occasions and has progressed a number of matters including, requesting the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to indicate what accommodation is available.  It is also finalising an information pack on the range of services and supports that are available for those in the system with status to assist them in the transition from Direct Provision accommodation and plans to run a Pilot Information Programme for persons granted status in a number of areas of the country.</p>  <p>  The work of the Taskforce is key as it is essential that persons who are granted status are supported in transitioning out of the Direct Provision system and thus do not spend any longer than is necessary in the system once a positive decision on their case has been made.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. There were 12 station closures in County Kerry in 2012 and 2013 and Garda management inform me that the policing service provided by them to the Kerry Division through the restructuring of the Garda station network is delivering greater efficiencies in the deployment of personnel and other resources.  </p><p>I am further informed that the restructured station network continues to provide the necessary levels of policing services through a centralisation of services which in turn has facilitated the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that are operational and intelligence led.  This helps ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout Divisions nationwide, including Kerry and yields the following benefits:</p><blockquote>-  Increased Garda visibility and patrol hours<br /><br />-  Increased mobility and flexibility within an area resulting in an improved policing service to the public<br /><br />-  Enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity resulting in a greater visibility and presence in the communities<br /><br />-  More effective use of limited resources across a wider area<br /><br />-  Continued Garda presence in communities</blockquote><p>In accordance with Section 22(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, any further organisation development initiatives will be outlined in future Policing Plans. </p><p>Figures provided for August 2015 for the same offence shows a Divisional figure of 36 Burglaries, which is a 43% decrease on the June figure of 63.  Of the 63 burglaries that occurred in June 2015, only two of these were committed in areas in which Garda Stations have closed &ndash; namely Moyvane and Cloghane.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that tackling organised crime in all its guises is a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this is clearly reflected in the Policing Plan for 2015.  Garda management advise that they are continuing to vigorously tackle organised crime through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations.  This includes the use of advanced analytical and intelligence methods in support of operations that enable early intervention and the prevention of such crimes.  </p><p>While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts.</p><p>Finally I have been assured by the Garda authorities that local Garda Management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  In that regard, ten newly appointed Probationer Garda&iacute; have been allocated to the Kerry Division since May 2015.  As additional personnel and resources become available, the needs of the Kerry Division will continue to be reviewed within the context of the overall needs of the Garda organisation. </p></reply>

Authorisations for lawful interception may only be granted in limited circumstances for the investigation of serious crime or in the interests of the security of the State to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 provides a legislative basis for covert surveillance activities.  Authorisations under the 2009 Act are granted by a Judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Revenue Commissioners or the Defence Forces.  As Minister for Justice and Equality I have no role in that process.  </p>  <p>  The 1993 and 2009 Acts make provision for independent judicial oversight of their operation by a serving Judge of the High Court who is designated for this purpose.  The Designated Judge reports at least annually to the Taoiseach on the operation of the legislation and these reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Acts also provide for a complaints mechanism whereby an individual who believes he or she has been the subject of an authorisation under the relevant provisions of the Acts may apply to the independent Complaints Referee for an investigation into the matter.  The Complaints Referee is Judge John Hannan of the Circuit Court who may be contacted at the Office of the Complaints Referee, &Aacute;ras U&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh, Inns Quay, Dublin 7.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. The review concluded that a revised District and station network commensurate with the organisations resource base would best meet public demand.  The revised structures continue to provide policing support through the restructuring of the station network. The centralisation of services facilitates the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that are operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system ensures that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country and that yields the following benefits:</p><blockquote>-  Increased Garda visibility and patrol hours<br /><br />-  Increased mobility and flexibility within an area resulting in an improved policing service to the public<br /><br />-  Enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity resulting in a greater visibility and presence in the communities<br /><br />-  More effective use of limited resources across a wider area<br /><br />-  Continued Garda presence in communities</blockquote><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed and is determined by a number of factors including population, crime trends and as the policing needs of each individual Division dictates.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p><p>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that they continue to have a focused, targeted and integrated approach to criminals involved in committing burglaries and will continue to develop and implement strategies available to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations to enable early intervention and prevention of such crimes. Local Garda&iacute; play a significant role in disrupting, preventing and detecting suspects and groups engaged in these criminal activities through focused and targeted roles and community policing initiatives including visible policing.

Anyone with concerns in relation to crime and anti-social behaviour should, of course, contact their local Garda station. </p>  <p>  The assignment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; are key components in providing visible policing in all areas of the country.

This humanitarian crisis is an EU issue which requires a coordinated EU response and I have made it clear to our European partners that Ireland will work closely and collaboratively with them in this regard. </p><p>As part of the Government's response to the crisis, I brought proposals to Government which were considered and agreed at a special Cabinet meeting on 10 September. A multifaceted approach is being adopted including the following measures:</p><blockquote>-  establishing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme which will provide international protection for up to 4,000 persons overall under Resettlement and Relocation Programmes. It is expected that these numbers will be augmented by further family reunifications. The first arrivals under the Programme are expected by year end. The number of persons in need of international protection will be kept under review;<br /><br />-  establishing a new cross-departmental Taskforce, chaired by my Department, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme.  The Taskforce, which has already had its first meeting, will adopt a whole of Government approach and will work with NGOs, religious bodies, local authorities and the Red Cross to implement the Government's response to this crisis;<br /><br />-  engaging with the public on their pledges of support. The Red Cross will lead this task;<br /><br />-  establishing a network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres for the initial reception of those arriving under the relocation programme;<br /><br />-  introduce the International Protection Bill as a major priority; and<br /><br />-  providing an additional package of processing resources to deal with major increases in asylum and other immigration cases, including the relocation measure, preparation for the Single Protection application process and increased enforcement across a number of areas, including removals.</blockquote><p>The resettlement programme for those coming from mostly Lebanon and predetermined as refugees by the UNHCR has already commenced and the first Syrians have arrived. The first group of Relocation asylum seekers from Italy and Greece are expected to arrive later this year. Of the first overall allocation of 40,000 formally approved at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 September 2015, Ireland has agreed to take a total of 600.</p><p>Further discussions are ongoing at EU level and I will be attending a further emergency meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council today in advance of an EU Summit to be held tomorrow. At today's meeting it is hoped that agreement at EU level can be reached on the relocation of a further 120,000 asylum seekers from countries in Southern Europe. Ireland has indicated that it will, subject to Oireachtas approval, opt-in to this measure.</p></reply>

My announcement followed an extensive consultation process with key stakeholders and hearings by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence on a report from a Joint Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na/Department of Justice and Equality Working Group published in November 2014. The changes announced will address issues in the short term but also map out the longer term future for a licensing system which balances the rights of those who wish to pursue their interests with public safety, which has to be the paramount consideration.</p>  <p>  I have announced my intention to make fundamental long term reforms in this area by proposing legislation for a Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority. The primary function of the Authority will be to determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing.  Individual licensing decisions will continue to be made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the light of the determinations made by the Authority but it is intended that the Authority will adjudicate on appeals from decisions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This will offer an alternative to the current system of court appeals.</p>  <p>  I have signed secondary legislation re-defining what constitutes a non-restricted handgun. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure persons who currently hold licences for handguns will be able to reapply for a license in the current licensing round. This legislation will clarify for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na what firearms may be considered by them for licensing. </p>  <p>  I intend to monitor the number of 0.22 inch rim fire calibre handguns being licensed. In line with my commitment to prevent any proliferation of handgun availability in Ireland, if there is a significant increase in the number of applications for new certificates or import licence applications for these handguns, I will introduce priority legislation for a future cap. </p>  <p>  I have also introduced an immediate temporary cap on the licensing of any new centre-fire semi-automatic rifles pending the establishment and determination of the Authority. Legislation will provide for the revocation of any licences issued between 18 September 2015 and the enactment of the legislation. The current arrangements introduced in 2008 whereby no new licences will be issued for centre fire handguns will remain in place.</p>  <p>  I have also announced my intention to ask the Garda Inspectorate to review the administration of firearms licensing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when the Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority is in place for a period of 12 months.</p>  <p>  I also intend to re-establish the Firearms Consultative Panel to examine general issues of common concern which could include issues such as the establishment of a ballistic record of certain firearms, updated storage conditions for firearms and the reloading of ammunition.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Garda Commissioner intends to establish a centralised licensing system for restricted firearms, pending the establishment and determination of the Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority.</p></reply>

Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner. The Garda authorities inform me that they keep the current Garda CCTV arrangements under ongoing review in the context of changing operational requirements. In this regard the most recent information I have from the Garda Commissioner is that there are no plans to extend existing Garda CCTV systems at present.  The amount spent from within the Garda vote on Garda CCTV systems over the past three years is as follows:</p><blockquote>2012 - &euro;1.256m<br /><br />2013 - &euro;1.200m<br /><br />2014 - &euro;1.157m<br /><br />2015 -&euro;0.696m (as at end of August 2015)</blockquote><p>As regards community-based CCTV, a scheme was launched in 2005 which provided financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of a local community CCTV system.  Two rounds of funding were advertised under that scheme, most recently in 2007.  All of the funding provided under the previous two rounds has been fully allocated.</p><p>I am, however, very conscious of the value that communities place on CCTV and with this in mind I am giving consideration to having a review of the effectiveness of current community schemes carried out in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  The outcome of this review will inform future decisions on the continuation of the scheme.  </p></reply>

The Bill includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation.  When enacted, the Bill will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of EU, UN and Council of Europe legal instruments as well as implementing the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas committees.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Bill will provide for two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services. The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. </p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.</p>  <p>  The Bill is expected to be published in the coming days.</p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.</p></reply>

Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended by section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006) provides that any person who assaults a "peace officer", including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, acting in the execution of their duty is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years or both.  The maximum sentence was increased from 5 years to 7 years under the 2006 Act.</p>  <p>  In addition, in the case of assault causing serious harm, an offender can be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and could be subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the law already recognises the gravity of any attack on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are carrying out their duty and that the penalties in place reflect the seriousness with which such acts are viewed.

This process also takes account of the Law Reform Commission Report on the Limitation of Actions published in December 2011 (LRC 104 - 2011). In this Report, the Commission expressed the view that the principal legislation governing limitation of actions, the <i>Statute of Limitations 1957 </i>(as amended), is unnecessarily complex and in need of fundamental reform and simplification (Paragraph 1.21). The Commission made a series of recommendations in relation to enhancing the coherence of the broader limitation of actions regime including the introduction of a uniform two-year basic limitation period for common law actions.  The basic limitation period is recommended to run from the 'date of knowledge' of the plaintiff, which should be calculated by reference to the date on which the plaintiff first knew, or ought reasonably to have known, the salient and actionable points in relation to the injury, loss or damage in question (Paragraph 2.67). </p><p>It will also be recalled that, along with this ongoing process of consideration of the broader limitation of actions regime, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 2000 made important changes to the 1957 Statute of Limitations in relation to the bringing of an action arising from acts of sexual abuse done to a person while a child. As a result, the three-year limitation period in such cases does not start to run until the victim concerned has recovered sufficiently from the psychological injury to be able to decide whether to bring the action.</p><p>In my Department's ongoing consideration of the operation of the law in relation to the limitation of actions, be that at the broad systemic level or in relation to specific areas of action, the core objectives of the Law Reform Commission Report will continue to apply, namely, that &quot;a balance is struck between the competing rights of the plaintiff and the defendant, as well having regard to the public interest; in particular the right of the plaintiff of access to the courts and the right to litigate, the right of the defendant to a speedy trail and to fair procedures, as well as the public interest in the avoidance of delayed claims and the timely administration of justice.&quot; (Paragraph 1.85).  As part of the ongoing review of the operation of the law in relation to the Statute of Limitations at my Department I will, therefore, continue to take account of the Commission's recommendations and other relevant developments in the bringing forward of any future proposals for legislation in this area including, possibly, as part of any new programme of legislation.</p></reply>

In October 2014  a Working Group to report on improvements to the protection system, including Direct Provision and supports for asylum seekers was established by myself and Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in. The Working Group was chaired by former High Court Judge, Dr Brian McMahon, and its membership was drawn from a range of interests in the international protection area including, UNHCR, non-governmental organisations, protection applicants, academia and relevant Government Departments and Offices.</p>  <p>  The Report identifies the excessive length of time in the protection system as the most significant issue facing those in Direct Provision.  I am committed to tackling the lengthy delays in the protection system.  A number of initiatives have already been taken to deal with the number of cases on hand including: the scheduling of interviews of applicants on Saturdays; the transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner; the establishment of a legal panel to assist the Commissioner with this work; and the appointment of additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>  <p>  In addition, in March this year, following approval by Government, I published the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill which will provide for the introduction of a single applications procedure for international protection.  This reform will simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and will also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time applicants spend in the Direct Provision system.  It is intended to have this Bill enacted by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The primary objective of the programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. In its review of the Garda Station Network that informed the rationalisation programme, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.   </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities advise me that policing services in all areas continue to be provided as required through the revised structures.  In addition, the  centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that will be operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system will ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country and will yield the following benefits:</p>  <p>-  Increased Garda visibility and patrol hours</p>  <p>-  Increased mobility and flexibility within an area resulting in an improved policing service to the public</p>  <p>-  Enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity resulting in a greater visibility and presence in the communities</p>  <p>-  More effective use of limited resources across a wider area</p>  <p>-  Continued Garda presence in communities.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to providing the best possible policing service to the people of Ireland within the resources available.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly reviews and assesses the capabilities and the deployment of Garda resources to provide a policing service that meets the needs of the community.  The ability of the organisation to contribute to Public Safety. Public Service and Community Protection remains the foremost consideration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  The estimated savings on utilities and maintenance as a result of the closure of each station building is approximately &euro;4,000 per annum.  The closure of 139 Garda Stations has resulted in an estimated total saving to the state of &euro;556,000 per annum. However, as I have stated, the key objective involved when closing Garda stations was to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.</p></reply>

Organised criminal activity is currently being targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a number of fronts, including the use of focused intelligence-led operations by specialist units such as the Drugs and Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>CCTV systems for the purposes of crime prevention and as aids to policing fall into two distinct categories - Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.  The CCTV system in Manorhamilton was established as part of the Community Based CCTV scheme which was launchedin 2005 and  provided financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of a local community CCTV system.  Two rounds of funding were advertised under that scheme, most recently in 2007.  All of the funding provided under the previous two rounds has been fully allocated.</p><p>I am, however, very conscious of the value that communities place on CCTV and with this in mind I am giving consideration to having a review of the effectiveness of current community schemes carried out in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  The outcome of this review will inform future decisions on the continuation of the scheme.  </p></reply>

This is the most recent data available on the gender pay gap in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The gender pay gap is of concern because it impacts on women&rsquo;s life long earnings, economic independence, private pension provisions and risk of poverty in older years. There are many complex causes of the gap, including women&rsquo;s increased likelihood to work part-time; to work in particular sectors; to play a disproportionately large role in the provision of caring within the family; to be under-represented in leadership and management roles and to experience discriminatory and gender-biased workplace practices and pay systems. The undervaluing of women&rsquo;s work and the under-utilisation of women&rsquo;s skills is also a lost resource for the economy and for society.</p>  <p>  Reviewing and closing the gender pay gap remains a key element in the work of my Department. The National Women&rsquo;s Strategy includes a commitment to address the gender pay gap. Work ongoing in my Department includes fostering the advancement of women into decision-making roles and examining the possibilities of sharing maternity leave between parents and introducing paternity leave.</p></reply>

These include: more flexible rules regarding access to the free pre-school year, the provision on a limited ad hoc basis by the HSE of funding towards the cost of pre-school support assistants in some areas, elective modules on special needs in mandatory courses for early years practitioners, and various initiatives by City and County Childcare Committees, HSE/HSE funded services, and by Better Start&rsquo;s Early Years Specialist Service to support providers who need expert advice and guidance. In addition, the on-going reorganisation of disability therapy services into multi-disciplinary geographic-based teams by the HSE under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People  Programme and the early intervention and support that reconfigured teams provide is of importance in the context of mainstreaming. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this Government recognises that co-ordination and provision of appropriate pre-school supports for children with special needs could be improved. Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within mainstream pre-school settings.</p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health are working together to develop a new model of pre-school supports for children with special needs.  My Department is leading the process, with full and active support from the other two Departments and their respective agencies.  </p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Group comprising representatives from these three Departments, the HSE, Tusla, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, Better Start and the Dublin City Childcare Committee has identified a range of pre-school supports for children with additional needs - some of which are similar to the supports outlined by the Early Childhood Ireland 'Footsteps for the Future' report. This Group is now expected to make a cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required in time for the Estimates process. </p></reply>

This Programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school. The Programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.  Eligibility for this Programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.   The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  </p>  <p>  The recent Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established earlier this year, sets out a range of options for future investment to enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years, after-school and out-of-school childcare, including  the development of quality standards for after-school childcare, a capital fund to support the development of after-school childcare services, consultation with children on after-school childcare, and ultimately a subvention system to amalgamate existing Programmes.

This Programme, which has an annual cost of over &euro;170 million, benefits in the region of 67,000 children every year. </p>  <p>  To deliver the free pre-school year, a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is currently paid to participating early years services. A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week is paid per eligible child to services with more highly qualified staff.  This kind of funding mechanism provides the leverage to progressively build the quality of early years provision, while at the same time making childcare more affordable to parents and improving the sustainability of the sector. </p>  <p>  Despite the downturn and the difficult budgetary situation, the Government did maintain the pre-school year on a universal and free basis and, importantly, the number of  early years services participating in the  Programme remained consistent. The funding provided under the  ECCE Programme to these services was a guaranteed source of income at that time and ensured that early years services were able to continue to deliver services at a time when the demand for childcare had fallen considerably.  </p>  <p>  The recent Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established earlier this year, sets out a range of options for future investment to enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years services, including an increase to ECCE capitation payments to services.

There are currently 109 communities supported through the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme funded by Tusla.</p>  <p>  Tusla values the work of Family Resource Centres and recognises the positive impact of their work in supporting families and local communities.  Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to children and families in their communities. </p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres are supported by two Regional Support Agencies, Framework and West Training and Development. These support agencies play a key role in promoting good practice within the programme and providing technical support, advice and training to Family Resource Centres. Going forward Tusla proposes to continue to fund these agencies for these purposes.</p>  <p>  Tusla provides funding to the Family Resource Centre National Forum (Forum) to support its activities. The Agency fully appreciates and values the work of the Forum as a support network working with all the Family Resource Centres throughout Ireland.  The Forum represents the views of all Family Resource Centres nationally and provides networking and training opportunities, information and practical support for its members. </p>  <p>  This Forum is a valuable asset in the overall operation of the programme. It ensures a representative voice at national level and coherence within the programme. In recognition of the valuable contribution the Family Resource Centre National Forum makes to the work of Family Resource Centres, Tusla intends to continue to provide funding to the Forum.</p>  <p>  The Agency also fully recognises the need to maintain accurate up-to-date statistics demonstrating the valuable contribution Family Resource Centres make to Tusla&rsquo;s strategic aims and objectives. To this end, Tusla already has in place a software-based data collection and self-evaluation system entitled SPEAK (Strategic Planning, Evaluation and Knowledge System) available to each Family Resource Centre. A key feature of SPEAK is that it can operate across multiple Family Resource Centres so that the data collected from each Project is collated into a single database. </p>  <p>  Increasingly, SPEAK data is being used at programme level to present an overview of what is happening at national level. This data informs quarterly reports that demonstrate the contribution of Family Resource Centres to the overall work of Tusla. </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that it welcomes the many worthwhile proposals that the Deputy has put forward to improve and build on the strengths of the Family Resource Centre Programme in meeting its mandate for community-based early intervention and family support.

It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires. Aftercare is available to all those eligible irrespective of which care sector they have been in, i.e. foster care or residential care.</p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.</p>  <p>  Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that Tusla - the Child and Family Agency may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a &ldquo;need for assistance&rdquo;. The provisions have been interpreted and applied on the basis that young people who have had a care history with the Agency are entitled to an assessment of need, from which an aftercare plan may be prepared and an aftercare service may be offered (based on the assessed needs).</p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.  Accordingly, in instances where a young person leaving care has experienced trauma and/or a developmental delay and is not yet ready to embrace independent living, due regard will be given within the aftercare planning process to linkages with appropriate, specialist, adult services.</p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to Tusla, at the end of March, 2015, there were 1,720 young people aged 18 to 22 years inclusive in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 1,012 (59%) were in full time education.  </p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of young people are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  </p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in respect of my plans to amend Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly.</p></reply>

While carried out on behalf of the Government Department responsible for the legislation, all such processes are conducted by the relevant Oireachtas Committees independent of the associated Departments.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children that the general process for pre-legislative scrutiny is that upon receiving the Heads of a Bill, the Committee receives a briefing paper / advice from the independent Library and Research Service, which includes suggestions with regard to the most appropriate approach for stakeholder consultation.  The Committee may also wish to invite stakeholders to discussions based on submissions and / or concerns already expressed.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children has assured me that it does not exclude any stakeholder from the consultation process.  </p>  <p>  Some 93% of children in State care today are cared for in foster homes, many of whom are supported to continue living with their foster parents after reaching 18 years of age.  Without doubt, the commitment and dedication demonstrated by foster carers towards the children in their care profoundly impacts the lives of those children as they become young adults and embark upon life after care.  As such, I recognise that the insights of those caring for them are extremely valuable and insights that I welcome.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the implementation of the National Leaving and Aftercare Policy, 2011, Tusla &ndash; the Child and Family Agency has advised me that the policy, which provides a framework for the delivery of aftercare services nationally, was signed off in April, 2011.  An implementation plan was developed outlining key work to be undertaken by Tusla in order to ensure full compliance with the National Leaving and Aftercare Policy.  That implementation plan has resulted in the introduction of several new practices, including the establishment of steering groups, the development of dedicated teams, and the standardisation of the aftercare allowance.  Tusla continues to review its current policy to reflect new legislative changes.  In so doing, Tusla will continue to work in partnership with agencies that represent the views of children in care and foster carers.</p>  <p>  Tusla is in the process of establishing full dedicated teams nationally along with operational steering groups in each area.  Tusla has also advised that at the end of March, this year, 78% of 18-22 years olds in receipt of an aftercare service had an aftercare plan while 81% had an aftercare worker.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of homelessness for care leavers, Tusla reports that at the end of March, 2015, the vast majority of 18-22 years olds in receipt of an aftercare service were residing in some form of stable accommodation.  In fact, 45% of those care leavers remained living with their foster carers, 23% were living independently, 11% returned home, 4% were living in supported lodgings and 5.5% were living in residential centres.  Only a small minority (11.5%) were living in other types of less stable accommodation.  While significant progress has already been made, work continues in my Department and Tusla to reduce the risk of vulnerable young care leavers finding themselves homeless or in unstable or unsuitable accommodation.</p></reply>

This Programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school. The Programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.  Eligibility for this Programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.   The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.</p>  <p>  The recent Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established earlier this year, sets out a range of options for future investment to enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years, after-school and out-of-school childcare, including  the development of quality standards for after-school childcare, consultation with children on after-school childcare, a subvention system to amalgamate existing Programmes and a capital fund to support the development of after-school childcare on school premises.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Education and Skills is supportive of coherent measures that facilitate greater community use of schools while respecting the core role of schools.  In relation to use of existing school premises, Minister O'Sullivan is of the view that, in the first instance, the core role of a school in delivering  education to its student body has to be paramount and any additional activities have to adhere to that core role.   There are also a number of practical issues, such as lease terms, insurance, etc., that need to be properly examined for schools considering additional activities on their premises.</p>  <p>  The options in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group  are currently being considered as part of the Estimates Process for 2016.</p></reply>

This funding is largely directed towards a number of childcare programmes, which aim to improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of early years and school-age care and education. These programmes support the provision of early years and school-age care and education for more than 100,000 children each year.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all the benefits of this (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. It is critically important that any investment is designed to achieve the best outcomes for children and their parents. Accordingly, earlier this year, I established an Inter-Departmental Group to set out a range of options for future investment, including options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision of early years and school age care and education. Membership of the Group included representation from right across Government, including the Departments of Education and Skills, Jobs and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and as well as the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and an Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  The work of the Group was informed by research and evidence of best practice and by existing policy commitments, including those set out in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. To inform its work, the Group also solicited the views of key stakeholders, interested parties and the general public through a number of consultative processes, including two separate online consultation processes - one with the early years sector and one with parents and guardians, and an Open Policy Debate, which was hosted by my Department on 31 March 2015 and attended by some 40 invited representatives including parents, providers, academics, childcare committees, and NGOs. It has also held a series of bilateral discussions with relevant Government Departments, including the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills, Finance, Jobs and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  I published the report of the Inter-Departmental Group on 22 July to facilitate a further debate within the sector and among parents generally about the value of and priority that should be attached to the various options for future investment, which were set out in the report.

These programmes include the Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) programme providing support to parents availing of training and education courses provided by Solas or the Education Training Board (ETB), the After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme and a Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme supporting qualifying parents who are participating in Community Employment (CE) schemes.  </p>  <p>  The funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.</p>  <p>  I recognise the difficulties being faced by childcare providers and parents and I am aware of their concerns in relation to the sustainability of services.  I am looking at the question of appropriate supports for childcare in the wider context. The Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established earlier this year, has set out a range of options for  future investment, including options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision of early years and school-aged childcare.</p>  <p>  I published the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on 22 July to facilitate a further debate within the sector and among parents generally about the value of and priority that should be attached to the various options for future investment, which were set out in the Report.

However, current figures indicate that approximately 95% of eligible children participate in the ECCE programme every year.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that all children have the opportunity to access and benefit from this free preschool year and has, in addition to the HSE, made various practical efforts in recent years to support mainstreamed provision for children with special needs. These include: more flexible rules regarding access to the free preschool year, the provision on a limited ad hoc basis by the HSE of funding towards the cost of preschool support assistants in some areas, elective modules on special needs in mandatory courses for early years practitioners, and various initiatives by City and County Childcare Committees, HSE/HSE funded services, and by Better Start&rsquo;s Early Years Specialist Service to support providers who need expert advice and guidance. In addition, the on-going reorganisation of disability therapy services into multidisciplinary geographic-based teams by the HSE under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People  Programme and the early intervention and support that reconfigured teams provide is of importance in the context of mainstreaming. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this Government recognises that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for preschool children with special needs could be improved. Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within mainstream preschool settings.</p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health are working together to develop a new model of supports for preschool children with special needs.  My Department is leading the process, with full and active support from the other two Departments and their respective agencies.  </p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Group comprising representatives from these three Departments, the HSE, Tusla, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, Better Start and the Dublin City Childcare Committee has completed its work and is expected to make a cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required in time for the Estimates process.</p></reply>

The transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people and a key factor in achieving success is ensuring that assessment, preparation and planning for leaving care begins in the years prior to leaving care and continues as part of the care planning process.  This work is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate an aftercare plan that is specific to the individual young person's needs.</p><p>The system care supports provided to the young person will be based on their assessed needs.  The needs of young people vary widely. Financial support is one element of this support.  Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of this service and these supports are available to all care leavers.  For those young people who are not in training or education, aftercare services have a key role in providing support to them in liaising with the relevant departments and agencies in accessing financial assistance, employment opportunities, training or supporting them to return to education.</p><p>I have been advised by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, that following consultation Tusla has introduced a Standardised National Aftercare Allowance for young people who have been in care for 12 months on their 16th birthday or for 12 consecutive months prior to their 18th birthday.  This weekly standardised allowance of &euro;300 per week ensures equality for all care leavers engaged in training and education.</p><p>This allowance is the first step in a phased development of aftercare services and will provide certainty and consistency for care leavers for the first time.  Each care leaver as part of their leaving and aftercare planning will have an Individual Financial Support Plan.  This plan forms part of an assessment of need which takes account of all sources of financial support from Tusla, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>The introduction of this aftercare allowance is a step in demonstrating Tusla's commitment to an aftercare service that offers consistent supports to ensure that young people leaving care and aftercare reach their potential in adult life.  </p><p>Tusla will issue a number of frequently asked questions in relation to this matter on its website, in the coming days.</p></reply>

All childcare programmes supported by my Department currently provide funding directly to childcare providers, either in the form of capitation or subvention payments. This kind of funding mechanism provides the leverage to progressively build the quality of childcare provision, while at the same time making childcare more affordable. </p>  <p>  To deliver the free preschool year under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating services. To incentivise higher quality, a higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week is paid per eligible child to services with more highly qualified staff. Parents who qualify for support under this programme can have their annual childcare costs reduced by as much as &euro;2,774 for each qualifying child. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families, and in the case of full day care, parents can have their weekly childcare costs reduced by up to &euro;95 per week for each qualifying child.   </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of programmes which support parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the:</p>  <p>  1.	Childcare Education and Training Supports programme for parents availing of training and education courses; </p>  <p>  2.	Community Employment Childcare programme for parents in Community Employment schemes; and </p>  <p>  3.	After-School Childcare programme for after-school care.   </p>  <p>  For these three programmes, the maximum contribution a parent makes to the cost of childcare is capped at &euro;15 per week for part-time and after-school care and &euro;25 per week in the case of full-day care. </p>  <p>  I recognise the difficulties being faced by both childcare providers and parents and I am looking at the question of appropriate supports for child care in the wider context. The Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established in February this year, has set out a range of options for current and future investment, including options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision of early years and school age care and education.</p>  <p>  I published the report of the Inter-Departmental Group on 22 July to facilitate a further debate within the sector and among parents generally about the value of and priority that should be attached to the various options for further investment, which were set out in the report.  I will have specific proposals to make in the context of the Estimates process for Budget 2016.</p></reply>

This investment was provided to address the increasing demand for childcare services resulting from the rapid expansion of the Irish economy and the increased participation of women in the workforce.  The majority of this investment was provided to the community/not-for-profit childcare sector with the emphasis on ensuring that parents in disadvantaged communities that were not served by private childcare providers had access to quality and affordable childcare services. </p>  <p>  To ensure that these childcare facilities, some of which have been providing services now for almost twenty years, are in a position to continue to deliver quality childcare services, it is necessary that the infrastructure is satisfactorily maintained.  It is for this reason that the greater portion of recent capital funding has been directed to community/ not-for-profit childcare services.</p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme is implemented by this Department with funding provided to community/ not-for-profit childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to low income and disadvantaged families. In excess of &euro;40 million is provided annually by my Department to support the CCS programme and this enables the parents of some 25,000 children to avail of affordable childcare.  In the region of 900 community/not-for-profit childcare services participate in the CCS programme and they qualify for funding on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  Private childcare services are currently not eligible to participate in this programme.</p>  <p>  In the region of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support a range of childcare support programmes.  Almost &euro;220 million of this funding is available to childcare providers, both community/ not-for-profit and private, with for example more than 3,000 private childcare providers participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which has annual funding of more than &euro;170 million.  </p>  <p>  The recent Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment, which I established earlier this year, sets out a range of options for future investment to enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years, after-school and out-of-school childcare, including  the development of a new childcare subvention system to amalgamate existing targeted programme. Under this new system, all targeted childcare programmes would be open to both community/not-for-profit and private childcare providers. The options in this Report are being considered as part of the Estimates Process for 2016.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-22a.1746.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200090#WRGG03700"><p>It is now widely accepted that young people leaving State care face a unique set of challenges and present, in some instances, with particular vulnerabilities.  It is this recognition that underpins both the current aftercare provision as well as the forthcoming Aftercare Bill.  Such awareness has been due to analyses of a range of reports, both State sanctioned and from a range of advocates for young people in and leaving care, and also as a result of my own Department&rsquo;s direct communication and research undertaken with young people in State care. </p>  <p>  Aftercare is a term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires. Aftercare is available to all those eligible irrespective of which care sector they have been in i.e. foster care or residential care.</p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.</p>  <p>  Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that the Child and Family Agency may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a &ldquo;need for assistance&rdquo;. The provisions have been interpreted and applied on the basis that young people who have had a care history with the Agency are entitled to an assessment of need, from which an aftercare plan may be prepared and an aftercare service may be offered (based on the assessed needs).</p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.</p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to Tusla - the Child and Family Agency, at the end of March, 2015, there were 1,720 young people aged 18 to 22 years inclusive in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 1,012 (59%) were in full time education.  </p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of young people are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  </p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly.</p></reply>

The Inspection Report was published on 31 August 2015.  In Ballydowd Special Care Unit, single separation means the removal of a child to a separate locked room for as short a period as possible during times of challenging behaviour which poses a significant risk to themselves or others. </p>  <p>  The inspection report indicated that decisions to initiate single separation generally complied with national guidance and that children's Guardians ad Litem and social workers were informed when they took place.  However, it found that the practice was used for excessive lengths of time in a small number of cases, record keeping and notification to senior management was inadequate and there was a poor response to complaints made by children regarding the events. </p>  <p>  Following on from the inspection HIQA requested an immediate review of single separation that lasted for excessive periods of time. The outcome of the review led to an improvement in authorisation of single separation to ensure it is for the shortest time necessary and also enhanced recording and information sharing. Incidents of single separation that are longer than three hours are to be escalated to senior management and  improvements have also been put in place to have single separation in Special Care reviewed as part of the national significant event notification system. </p>  <p>  Restrictive practices and children's rights has been placed as a standing item for Tusla Managers.  Significant issues are also to be reviewed with a focus on rights.  An action plan, approved by HIQA, to address the standards identified as requiring improvement and at significant risk was published with the report. It noted that the majority of the actions had been implemented at the time of publication. The remainder were due to be completed by the end of Q4 2015.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that some of these children have very serious emotional and behavioural issues that can manifest themselves in the most challenging of behaviours. I believe that overall staff endeavour to provide the best possible care.</p></reply>

In the region of 67,000, including  children with special needs, avail of the free pre-school provision each year.   </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that all children have the opportunity to access and benefit from this free pre-school year and has, in addition to the HSE, made various practical efforts in recent years to support mainstreamed provision for children with special needs. These include: more flexible rules regarding access to the free pre-school year, the provision on a limited ad hoc basis by the HSE of funding towards the cost of pre-school support assistants in some areas, elective modules on special needs in mandatory courses for early years practitioners, and various initiatives by City and County Childcare Committees, HSE/HSE funded services, and by Better Start&rsquo;s Early Years Specialist Service to support providers who need expert advice and guidance. In addition, the on-going reorganisation of disability therapy services into multi-disciplinary geographic-based teams by the HSE under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People  Programme and the early intervention and support that reconfigured teams provide is of importance in the context of mainstreaming. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this Government recognises that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for pre-school children with special needs could be improved. Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within mainstream pre-school settings.</p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health are working together to develop a new model of supports for pre-school children with special needs.

As such, the &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; of a project to proceed, and be completed within the timeframe, was a major consideration when the applications were being reviewed. Applicants that could best demonstrate &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; were those that:</p><p>a)had obtained full planning permission, or could demonstrate that planning was not  required;</p><p>b)had completed an appropriate tendering process where tenders were still in date and valid; and</p><p>c)had confirmation that the project could be completed within the timeframe available.</p><p>Applications that were successful were those that represented the most complete, coherent, precise and compelling cases for funding. The investment is being directed, to the best extent possible, to making the greatest impact by addressing the most urgent works and supporting the quality of services making the greatest impact for disadvantaged children and communities.</p><p>Pobal, who administers the Programme on behalf of my Department has responsibility for evaluating each application against the Programmes criteria.  Pobal  has informed my Department that while the need for a new service was justified in this case, on an overall basis, the applicants did not demonstrate that this proposal was the best option for addressing the need. The group's application fell below the threshold for the following reasons:-</p><p>1. The scale of the project proposed was not justified; </p><p>2. Value for money was difficult to assess as there was not a clear rationale for costings provided. In comparison to similar rural type  applications, the amount requested was well over other applications where the costings were based on a clear rationale;  and </p><p>3. It was  noted that rock excavation may be required to prepare the site. The vagueness of the costings  and the length of time it would take to carry out a full procurement process were matters of concern in terms of the readiness of this proposal as well as value for money</p><p>There is provision under the Programme for a service not approved for funding under the Programme to appeal the decision to Pobal but no appeal was lodged in this case.</p></reply>

The other concern that the Agency has is that if it publishes claims&rsquo; data by individual hospital, this could lead to a &ldquo;league tables&rdquo; interpretation of the data without any further contextualisation of the data.

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm continues to be a priority for this Government.  The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives designed to support people who are suicidal and also supporting their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.</p><p>A key part of the work of the NOSP is to create an awareness within the community of positive mental health and suicide prevention.  In recent years, the NOSP has run a number of national media campaigns and has also sponsored non-statutory partners in their health promotion work.  The major NOSP campaigns include &lsquo;<i>Your Mental Health&rsquo;</i>and <i>&lsquo;Let Someone Know&rsquo;</i>.  It also funded campaigns targeted at specific groups within the community e.g. the farming community through Farm TV.These programmes have been well evaluated in terms of impact.The focus of these national campaigns is to assist the individual to understand the importance of looking after their mental health and to seek help at times of stress.</p><p>In October 2014, the NOSP in collaboration with over 25 partner organisations launched a new mental health awareness campaign entitled <i>&lsquo;Little Things&rsquo;. </i>The campaign features real people sharing their real stories, told through animated films and radio messages.  The ads are supported by a range of print and online illustrations of the #littlethings that are proven to protect and recover good mental health and wellbeing. The campaign has been developed in conjunction with mental health experts to highlight evidence-based advice for how little things can improve our mental health and wellbeing. It is designed to answer two very fundamental questions in relation to mental health: <i>What can I do?</i>and <i>Where can I go for help?</i>A new online multimedia information resource has been developed as part of the campaign.  This is the most comprehensive online repository of support services and information resources on mental health in Ireland, as well as giving tips on reaching out and listening.</p></reply>

The aim of bereavement support is to support those immediately affected by the death, to allow them to express their grief and to prevent more suicides from happening in the same area.  </p>  <p>  A range of local and national services provide suicide bereavement support to families and communities.  The HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention provides funding to Console to deliver suicide bereavement support services across the country.  The organisation has six regional offices and has a dedicated helpline for individuals bereaved by suicide. The National Office also provides funding to Counselling, Responding, Information &amp;amp; Bereavement Services in HSE South and to Mayo Suicide Liaison Project.   </p>  <p>  It is important that those providing bereavement support services follow evidence-based practice.

They are not political or ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  Sapropterin (Kuvan&reg;) was previously considered under the national pricing and reimbursement processes in 2009.

As of 15 September (latest figures available) there are 586 delayed discharges nationally, of which 308 are in the Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals. Delayed discharges can arise for a number of reasons in addition to difficulties in finding a suitable nursing home place.  For example, some patients have yet to apply for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and others are in the course of having their applications assessed and validated. Applicants are entitled to choose their own nursing home and while a facility may be available, the applicant may decide to wait for an option closer to home or to their family. </p>  <p>  The Government committed an additional &euro;25m in Budget 2015 to address delayed discharges.  Of this:</p>  <p>  -	&euro;10m was allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) to provide additional 300 places;</p>  <p>  -	&euro;8m was allocated for the provision of 50 additional short-stay beds, in addition to the establishment of Mount Carmel as a short-stay facility for the Dublin area;</p>  <p>  -	&euro;5m was allocated for an additional 400 Home Care Packages;</p>  <p>  -	&euro;2m was allocated to strengthen community care teams.</p>  <p>  In a further initiative earlier this year, the Government approved additional funding of &euro;74m, of which &euro;44m was allocated to the NHSS to provide an additional 1,600 places.  &euro;30m was used to provide additional transitional care beds (temporary contract beds) through June and additional community, convalescence and district hospital beds on a permanent basis.</p>  <p>  The waiting time for approved applicants for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme has been reduced from a previous high of 17 weeks to 2 - 4 weeks.  It is intended to maintain this at a maximum of 4 weeks.</p></reply>

However, raised levels can also exist in women who have a benign condition.  Furthermore, the level can be normal in women who do have ovarian cancer.  Therefore, Cancer Antigen 125 (CA125) is unsuitable for use as a population screening test as it could lead to over-diagnosis and unnecessary investigations, as well as  to false reassurances. </p>  <p>  The search for an effective screening method for ovarian cancer is ongoing internationally and this includes the investigation of combinations of CA125 blood testing and ultrasound scans. </p></reply>

Their recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  NIAC guidance is regularly updated and the latest updates including details of local and general adverse events to each vaccine are available on the HSE website.</p>  <p>  All vaccines provided by the HSE on the recommendation of NIAC to protect the public from disease are licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  No vaccine is or will be licensed by the HPRA and the EMA unless it is has been approved as safe by the Licensing Authority.</p>  <p>  Most proven reactions to vaccines are mild and self limiting.  Commonly the child may experience pain and tenderness at the injection site where the vaccine has been injected into a muscle.  These symptoms are generally mild and transient resolving completely in 2 to 3 days.  A fever may also develop after a vaccination.  These reactions are not allergic reactions.</p>  <p>  Local urticarial (hives) reactions are uncommon and these reactions are also transient and self limiting.</p>  <p>  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) after vaccination are extremely rare, occurring at a rate of 1 or less after every million vaccinations.  No international expert body such as the World Health Organisation, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and NIAC recommends testing a child for allergies before receiving a vaccine.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, the Government then set up a range of payments of up to &euro;100,000 along with supports, for the women who worked in these institutions.  In his report, Mr Justice Quirke recommended, inter alia, that legislation be introduced to give effect to his recommendation on the provision of a comprehensive suite of health services to Magdalen women.  The Health (Amendment) Act 1996 provides health services to persons who contracted hepatitis C in the State from a blood product or blood transfusion.  It should be noted, however, that Judge Quirke&rsquo;s report acknowledged that the HAA services were reproduced for illustrative purposes and recognised that not all of the HAA services described may be relevant to the Magdalen women and that the scheme for the Magdalen women would require suitable adaptation.</p><p>Eligibility for health services for the Magdalen women is now provided by the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 which sets out the primary and community health services available in Ireland, free of charge, effective from 1 July 2015.  Those services are as follows: GP services; prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; home nursing; home support; chiropody; physiotherapy; and counselling services.  As Justice Quirke recommended, the women are entitled to a greater range of entitlements than those provided under the standard medical card.  As a result, a specific card has been issued to the women so that they can access the enhanced health services they require without charge, as set out in the Act.</p><p>While the Quirke report did not make a recommendation that health services should be provided to women residing overseas, the Government has decided that practical administrative arrangements should be put in place to support women residing overseas for the same services.  The Department of Health and the HSE  are exploring the practical arrangements to be put in place for the overseas women as it is an important but complex matter.  I am sure that the Deputy recognises that all health systems around the world vary in organisation and that each system is practically unique and equally complex.  When practical arrangements are in place, the HSE will contact those participants living abroad in this regard, which I hope will be as soon as possible.</p></reply>

They are not political or ministerial decisions.</p>  <p>  Sapropterin (Kuvan&reg;) was previously considered under the national pricing and reimbursement processes in 2009.  At that time, insufficient evidence was available to support the pricing and reimbursement application submitted by the manufacturer, Merck Serono.</p>  <p>  Merck Serono recently commenced the process of resubmitting a new application for pricing and reimbursement of Kuvan; this application will now be considered in line with criteria set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and using the processes outlined in national pricing framework agreements.</p>  <p>  As the application process is still at a very early stage, it is not possible to discuss potential outcomes or comment further at this time.</p></reply>

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the Health Service executive as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.</p>  <p>  The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process, given the number and complexity of cases, and has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, it should be noted that the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of a National Disability Authority report commissioned by the Department of Health and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities, including autism, and their families to services, regardless of where they live, where these children go to school or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  Implementation of the Programme is a key priority for the HSE in 2015.  In 2014 an additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated to drive implementation of the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m has been allocated to the Programme this year.</p>  <p>  My Department has requested the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on the issues he has raised.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office who will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

In addition, the HSE is planning to recruit over 500 nurses across a number of nursing disciplines.  There is significant work being undertaken to achieve this.  This includes recent and ongoing national and local interviewing of all categories of nurses and midwives.  The HSE has also developed an International Nurse Recruitment Project for filling posts.  This initiative is a targeted recruitment drive in the UK primarily focused on Irish trained nurses who left during the moratorium.  In order to facilitate this the services of a recruitment agency has been secured.  At least 90 interviews have taken place and over 30 posts have been offered to candidates.</p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) since 1st January 2015:</p>  <p>  - 72 doctors have been nominated to hospital consultant posts, by the Public Appointment Service (this includes some doctors who were interviewed by the PAS in 2014), and</p>  <p>  - 65 doctors have accepted offers of contract (this includes some doctors who were offered contracts in 2014).</p>  <p>  The number of consultants has also grown significantly in recent years to 2,700.  This includes 700 more consultants in the last decade and 320 in the last five years, in spite of the economic crisis.  The Government is committed to future growth.  However, there are some specialties in which there is an international shortage and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale.  There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals.  The establishment of Hospital Groups will help to address this difficulty, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources.  The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly in recent years, by over 600 since the end of 2010, and now exceeds 5,000. This increase will help to address service needs and progress EWTD compliance, thereby improving the working conditions of doctors.</p>  <p>  The ability of the HSE and the health service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required.  The MacCraith Group was established  to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures.  The Group made a series of recommendations in its three reports aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and importantly, planning for future service needs.  The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored.  It is noted in particular that revised pay rates for new entrant consultants, incorporating incremental credit for relevant experience and qualifications, were proposed by the LRC in January this year to address the barrier caused by the variation in rates of remuneration between new entrant consultants and their established peers that had emerged since 2012 and that these are now being implemented.</p></reply>

The Government decided that the preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.  Policy proposals are in development and will be brought to Government for consideration and decision.  Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.  The Health (Transport Supports) Bill is included in the Governments legislative programme for 2015.</p>  <p>  In the years leading up to the closure of the scheme, approximately 4,700 people were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, at an annual cost in the region of &euro;9 million.  The Government is aware of the needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments which support choice and independence.  Monthly payments of up to &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to the 4,700 people who were in receipt of Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme was closed.  These payments are continuing in order to prevent hardship and alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p></reply>

Where this is not possible, the Health Service Executive supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  It is my objective to ensure that available resources are deployed to achieve the best possible outcomes for older people.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2015 projects the expected provision of 10.3m hours help hours this year and that 13,800 people will be in receipt of a home care package.</p>  <p>  The recently completed Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) considers the way that residential care is currently balanced with care in the community, and endorses the Government's view that effective community supports can reduce the reliance of older people on residential nursing home care.</p>  <p>  The NHSS could not be extended to cover home care in its existing form, as under the NHSS, participants contribute towards the costs of their care in accordance with their means, with a large proportion paying 80% of their income for this purpose.  This would not work in the community as  service users would still have to meet their day to day living expenses.  It must also be recognised that while differences arise in the dependency levels of residents, the NHSS generally provides a fairly standard level of service and thus lends itself to a standardised support system, whereas home services can vary much more widely.</p>  <p>  A Single Assessment Tool is already being developed which will allow for much more consistent and objective assessment of the needs of older people and as a result a better targeting of available resources to where they are most needed, and will deliver the best outcomes.</p></reply>

In 2012, the HSE introduced a procurement framework for external providers.  This included quality standards in terms of governance &amp;amp; accountability, person centred care, complaints management, training and qualifications.  Providers are monitored through Service Level Agreements and are required to provide a range of information in relation to the services provided.  They are supervised through regular operational meetings and care plan reviews.</p>  <p>  As of now the Health Information and Quality Authority's remit does not include home care services.  My Department is currently considering how the quality of these services can be best assured so that service users can have full confidence in home care services, whether these be provided by the HSE or privately procured.  I have instructed that this be progressed as a matter of priority.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-22a.2122.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200097#WROO01600"><p>The 2011-2016 Programme for Government committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS) so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives. In our statement of Health priorities for 2015, the Minister for Health and I have reiterated our commitment to implementing the Strategy.</p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing. As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am driving implementation at the political level. The Strategy is a cross-Departmental one and my Department has an overall coordinating and collating role and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.</p><p>A key objective of this Strategy is to change the mindsets of decision makers across Government agencies and to raise the priority that is given to the concerns of older people. The first step in doing this is to establish a system of regular reporting on actions and initiatives that impact on older people, and these reports are regularly sought and collated by my Department. The fact that such reports are already and will continue to be required will in itself increase the focus that is given to older persons' issues, and these reports will be submitted for consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform chaired by An Taoiseach.  Implementation is accordingly an ongoing process.</p><p>It is important to point out the many initiatives already in train which contribute to the Strategy's goals. For example, in the health sector, in the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was published on 20th July 2015 and implementation of the recommendations contained therein will commence shortly.  The Single Assessment Tool, which will allow for a systematic assessment of need and allocation of services to older people, is being developed by the HSE; measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved. The Deputy will also be aware that &euro;25m<b></b>was allocated in Budget 2015 to support services that provide alternati  ves to, and relieve pressures on acute hospitals.  In April 2015, an additional &euro;74m was allocated to further tackle the ongoing issue of delayed discharges in acute hospitals. The majority of these patients are older people, and these funds are being applied across both long term and short term residential services and at community level.  As a result the waiting time for funding of approved patients under the Nursing Home Support scheme has fallen from 11 weeks to the previous norm of 4 weeks for the rest of the year.</p><p>A Healthy and Positive Ageing  Initiative (HaPAI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years. The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Ageing Strategy. This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years. A preliminary positive ageing report has been published and provides an overview of current evidence available on the lives of older people.The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.</p></reply>

The report contains 165 recommendations, and in particular emphasised the need to move from the often paternalistic interpretation of the existing legislation, to one where insofar as is possible, the individual has the final say in what he/she deems to be in his/her best interests and receives the best quality of service required to attain the highest standard of mental health.  It also includes provisions which are intended to strengthen the protections for people who are detained without consent in approved centres.</p><p>I have received Government approval for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill to amend the existing legislation to reflect the recommendations of the Expert Group and work in the Department is progressing on these important amendments.  In addition, I have also received approval for an early change to the legislation in respect of the administration of Electro-consulsive therapy (ECT) and the administration of medicine.In both cases, the existing legislation will be amended to remove the authority to give ECT or medicine (after 3 months) without consent in any circumstances where the patient is capable of giving consent but unwilling to do so. I plan to have a Bill before the Oireachtas this term to enact these amendments.</p><p><i>'A Vision for Change, </i>which was published in 2006,<i></i>provides<i></i>a seven-to-ten year framework for the development of our mental health services.  Since coming into office, this Government has prioritised the reform and resourcing of our mental health services in line with the recommendations in <i>A Vision for Change.</i>Additional funding totalling &euro;125 million has been provided primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health teams for both adults and children and to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, and forensic mental health services.  Implementation of <i>Vision</i>is ongoing and work is being undertaken during 2015 to prioritise outstanding actions informing the identification of any gaps in service.<i></i>Preliminary work on the development of a successor policy to <i>A Vision for Change</i>is underway and the parameters of a review will be agreed shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-22a.2244.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200099#WRQQ03700"><p>Government policy is to enable young people with disabilities to develop the skills they will need to live independent lives to the greatest extent possible, and to receive the supports they need in order to achieve this.  Additional funding of &euro;12 million, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of around 1,500 young people who will require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training this year, of which &euro;6 million is available to provide services from September.</p>  <p>  In January 2015, a National Project Group was established by the HSE to develop and oversee a national process to responding to the needs of these young people and to ensure a consistent approach is taken across the country to meeting those needs.  This initially involved identifying all individuals who would require a day service in 2015.  Some young people with disabilities progress to vocational training, which is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills, or to further education, or employment and do not require a health-funded service.  Other young people attend mainstream schools and are not in contact with the health services until they require health-funded supports on leaving school.  Once individuals are identified and their individualised needs are assessed, the capacity of the existing services to meet those needs is determined.  It is not until this process is completed that the number, location and type of additional support needs and resources can be finalised.  </p>  <p>  Finding the resources and the physical capacity to meet the needs of a growing number of new service users every year is a challenging task.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available, therefore, an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.</p>  <p>  The approach adopted by the National Project Group from the outset was that a cost banding structure would be developed to inform the allocation of the available funds.  The costing bands were then applied to the identified need in each of the county&rsquo;s nine regions so that a nationally consistent approach would be applied, which was needs-based as opposed to population-based.  Based on this cost-band structure, five support levels were identified and the following amounts were allocated for new placements at each support level: intensive support (&euro;34,000); high (&euro;16,000); moderate (&euro;11,000); low (&euro;7,000) and minimum (&euro;5,000). </p>  <p>   Most young people have been offered a placement from September which meets their needs.  Only a small minority of placements remain to be finalised.  The HSE is in contact with these young people and their families in order to resolve matters as quickly as possible.  Over the coming weeks, the HSE will continue to actively work with service providers and families until placements are finalised for all young people at this important transition point in their lives and they will ensure that resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most effective manner possible. </p></reply>

Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive care of the highest standard and to live in dignity and safety.  People with a disability should be able to maximise their potential and live rich and fulfilling lives.</p>  <p>  Compliance with HIQA standards for disability residential centres is a requirement under the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and voluntary service providers. </p>  <p>  66% of designated centres for people with a disability were inspected by HIQA by the end of Quarter 2 2015, including inspections triggered by complaints or allegations of mistreatment.  The lessons learned from them are continuing to improve the quality of services.  Clients and their families can be assured that this regulatory regime is being rolled out across all residential facilities for people with a disability.  </p>  <p>  HIQA has reported evidence of good practice in the delivery of many residential services to people with disabilities where the support and care needs of residents have been prioritised and there is a strong focus on the needs of service users.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has requested the HSE to develop action plans to address cases where HIQA has raised serious concerns regarding the level of care that people with a disability are receiving in a number of disability centres, including safeguarding the human rights of residents.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures to improve the quality and safety of residential services for people with disabilities.  Much work remains to be carried out on an ongoing basis to ensure all facilities comply with Disability Residential Standards.  While this programme will be challenging for the HSE, it is crucial in safeguarding vulnerable people in the care of the State.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, as these relate to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  </p>  <p>  The vaccine has not been available since the end of April 2015.  Babies born after the last day of April have not been immunised, this equates to approximately 5,500 babies a month, so around 24,000 to-date.  It is anticipated that the vaccine will be available near the end of the year so if vaccinations begin in January there will be approximately 44,000 babies to immunise.  The exact backlog will clearly be dependent on when the vaccine becomes available.</p>  <p>  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG and with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) who licenses vaccines in Ireland as well as with other relevant stakeholders.  The HPRA have been seeking to find an alternative supply of BCG that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer of BCG vaccine has been found.</p>  <p>  The HPRA confirmed that it was contacted by an Irish company in August 2015, which advised that it could procure some Infant BCG Vaccine from InterVax in Ontario, Canada.  The HPRA highlights that the company InterVax is a distributor for this product rather than a manufacturer or marketing authorisation holder.  The vaccine in question is currently not authorised for use in Ireland.   </p>  <p>  The HPRA followed up with both the Irish company and contacts within the regulatory network.  The information which was made available to the HPRA in relation to this BCG vaccine was extremely limited and was not considered to be sufficient to allow for the assessment of the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine.  Consequently, the HPRA was not in a position, without further data, to undertake a comprehensive review or to approve the use of this medicine (which is primarily used for the vaccination of infants) in Ireland.  The HPRA subsequently outlined its concerns to the Irish company involved, which acknowledged them.</p>  <p>  This company was also advised that should it submit a regulatory submission, providing the necessary data on this BCG vaccine, the HPRA would be happy to assess the medicine for safety, quality and efficacy, in an expedited timeframe.  The company indicated that it did not wish to pursue this option.</p>  <p>  In early 2015 the HSE asked the HPRA to look at extending the shelf life of BCG vaccine from 12 months to 18 months.  The HPRA reviewed the necessary documentation and agreed to extend the shelf life of any new delivery of BCG vaccine to 18 months.  Any new deliveries of BCG will have an 18 month shelf life.</p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the National TB Advisory Committee have recommended stopping routine BCG vaccination of newborn babies and instead provide a selective vaccination of babies in high-risk babies groups.  The Department of Health have requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to conduct a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to review the implications of this change.  HIQA commenced a public consultation on proposed changes to the BCG vaccination programme in Ireland on September 9th 2015.</p>  <p>  Tuberculosis (TB) is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 452 of 2011).  In 2014, 328 cases of TB were notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, giving a national TB notification rate of 7.1 per 100,000, the lowest rate reported since surveillance commenced.  According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of a low incidence TB country is one with a national TB notification rate of less than 10 cases per 100,000, Ireland is in this category.</p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of TB has been falling and there were no cases of TB in young children in 2014.  Most European countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland do not give BCG vaccine to all babies.  Babies are not at risk of TB because of the delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Resolving the issue of the shortage of BCG remains a priority for the HSE.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred.  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she should take the matter up with the consultant and the hospital involved.  In relation to the specific case raised, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

It is within this professional setting that the best options for treatment are most appropriately discussed, and advice received as to where services might be sought, including availing of the provisions of the 'Cross-Border' Directive for treatment within the EU\EEA.  It is also noteworthy that access to healthcare abroad under the Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways; that is, a referral is required in order to be eligible for reimbursement.  This referral is not limited to Irish health professionals but nevertheless the great majority of patients are likely to have consulted an Irish health professional who then referred them for treatment here or, if they wished, within the EU\EEA.  As a consequence, a general information campaign regarding the Cross Border Healthcare Directive, Directive 201/24/EU, has not been undertaken.  It is also noteworthy that Recital 4 of the Directive states &ldquo;the transposition of this Directive into national legislation and its application should not result in patients being encouraged to receive treatment outside their Member State of affiliation&rdquo;.  The HSE has tried to balance its dissemination of information regarding the Directive with this Recital in mind and has concentrated on informing the clinicians who make the referrals about the Directive.  To this end it has met with the ICGP and various consultants at hospital level to inform them of the provisions of the Directive.</p></reply>

In doing so, the HPRA is required to have regard to a comprehensive set of qualifying conditions, all of which must be complied with before a decision is taken to make a medicinal product interchangeable. </p>  <p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price the HSE will reimburse to pharmacists for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.</p>  <p>  For any medicine that is listed as being interchangeable the legislation provides that a Pharmacist may offer a generic or alternative version of the branded medicine which is set at the reference price.  Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products priced at or below the reference price.  If a patient would like to receive a particular brand that costs more than the reference price then the patient will have to pay the additional cost of that product. </p>  <p>  Section 13 of the Act provides that where a branded interchangeable product is prescribed for a patient and the prescriber is satisfied that the medicinal product, should for clinical reasons, be exempted from substitution, the prescriber shall write 'Do not Substitute' on the prescription.  In these cases, the pharmacist must dispense what is written on the prescription, i.e. is not permitted to substitute with any product in the same group of interchangeable products and patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.</p></reply>

Additional funding of &euro;12 million, of which &euro;6 million is available from September, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of around 1,500 young people who will require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training this year. </p>  <p>  In January 2015, a National Project Group was established by the HSE to develop and oversee a national process to responding to the needs of these young people and to ensure a consistent approach is taken across the country to meeting those needs.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available, therefore, an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.</p>  <p>  The approach adopted by the National Project Group from the outset was that a cost banding structure would be developed to inform the allocation of the available funds.  The costing bands were then applied to the identified need in each of the county&rsquo;s nine regions so that a nationally consistent approach would be applied, which was needs-based as opposed to population-based.  Based on this cost-band structure, five support levels were identified.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the breakdown of allocations under each funding band, as this is a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE.</p></reply>

The Minister for Health has no role in the day to day operations of any health insurance company. </p>  <p>  Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to provide a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. Minimum Benefit Regulations were introduced in 1996, under Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and cover in-patient, out-patient and day-patient services provided by publicly funded hospitals, private hospitals, registered nursing homes and hospital consultants. </p>  <p>  In the public hospital system, there is no statutory requirement for the HSE to provide Patient Transport Services (PTS). PTS are provided by the HSE on a discretionary basis as opposed to there being a mandatory requirement for provision. It is expected that, as a rule, patients should be in a position to make their own arrangements for journeys unless there are clear medical and/or mobility factors involved. An individual who is transported from one hospital to another hospital for a specific treatment or care is transferred medical advice. It is not intended to amend the Minimum Benefit Regulations to require health insurers cover the cost of such transport. This is consistent with the treatment of a public patient, where no statutory charges apply for such a transfer. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-22a.2421.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200103#WRUU02500"><p>Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  </p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>.  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.</p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit/risk profile for Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.</p><p>Up to the 15 July 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 901 reports of suspected adverse reactions/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>899 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>2).  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>.  The majority of the reports received to date involved events/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.</p><p>Healthy Ireland, the Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025, is the national Framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of the population of Ireland over the coming generation.  Vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18, which protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults, is a long-term investment as the initial costs of vaccination will be offset by improved health outcomes and treatment savings 15 to 30 years in the future.</p><p>The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>In the trials that led to the approval of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and , these vaccines were found to provide nearly 100 percent protection against persistent infections with HPV types 16 and 18 and the cervical cell changes that these persistent infections can cause.</p><p>To date, protection against the targeted HPV types has been found to last for at least 8 years with Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and at least 9 years with Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>.  Long-term studies of vaccine that are still in progress will help scientists better understand the total duration of protection.</p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to evaluate data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>.  The study conducted jointly by the French medicines agency (ANSM) and the French national health insurance fund (CNAMTS) compared the incidence of autoimmune conditions in girls given HPV vaccines with the incidence in girls not given the vaccines.  In the meantime, the EMA have advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of these vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>in accordance with the current product information.</p></reply>

This data is made available on a quarterly and annual basis and is categorised by county, age and gender.  A number of sources of information are used by the CSO to inform the classification of death including the Medical Cause of Death Certificate, the Coroner&rsquo;s Certificate and Form 104, a statistical form which is completed by An Garda Sioch&aacute;na following an inquest.  It should be noted that there can be a considerable delay between the death of a person and the holding of a Coroner&rsquo;s Inquest.  The most recent confirmed figures available for the number of deaths by suicide are for 2012, which show that there were 541 deaths that year.  While we have provisional figures for 2013 (475 deaths) and 2014 (459 deaths) these are subject to revision following the Coroners&rsquo; Inquests. </p><p>I would like to point out however, that all sudden and unexplained deaths of persons availing of mental health services are notified to the Mental Health Commission and are reviewed by the HSE.  Approved centres are required, under Article 14(4) of the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centres) Regulations 2006 to notify the Commission of all deaths, including sudden, unexplained deaths, of any resident of an approved centre as soon as possible and in any event within 48 hours of the death occurring.</p><p>All other mental health services which may include but are not limited to day hospitals, day centres, 24 hour staffed community residences and other mental health services such as out-patient departments, resource centres, group homes, out-reach teams, home-based treatment teams and other service types are required to notify the Commission of all sudden, unexplained deaths of persons availing of their service as soon as possible and in any event within 7 days of the death occurring.</p><p>Details of the deaths notified to the Mental Health Commission in 2014 are published in the Commission&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2014 which is available at .</p></reply>

If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office who will follow up the matter with them.</p><p>The Report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012 noted that the majority of Irish people drink in a harmful manner.  The report further noted that the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol were estimated to cost the Exchequer &euro;3.7 billion in 2007 representing 1.9% of Gross National Product that year.  The figure is taken from the report, &quot;Costs to Society of Problem Alcohol Use in Ireland&quot;, 2011.  The estimate is based on the methods used in similar reports from other developed countries including the United Kingdom and used data from surveys and surveillance systems.  The costs are broken down as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>&euro; million</th><th>% of Total Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Cost to the healthcare system of alcohol-related illnesses</td><td>1,200</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related crime</td><td>1,189</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related road accidents</td><td>526</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of output lost due to alcohol-related absence from work</td><td>330</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related accidents at work</td><td>197</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related suicides</td><td>167</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of alcohol-related premature mortality</td><td>110</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,719</td><td>100</td></tr></table></p><p>I hope the above clarifies the cost of financial resources spent. </p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. </p><p>Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown. The information on waiting times for treatment for Quarter 2 of 2015 for the two HSE regions which include Dublin is as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment </th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>25-48<br /><br />months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>897</td><td>985</td><td>1,675</td><td>1,243</td><td>199</td><td>4,999</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>271</td><td>518</td><td>1,032</td><td>1,585</td><td>748</td><td>4,154</td></tr></table></p><p>While there is no scheme in place whereby the HSE makes arrangements for patients to receive orthodontic treatment in Northern Ireland, under EU Directive 201/24/EU, now commonly referred to as the Cross Border Directive (CBD),  it is open to persons entitled to public patient healthcare in Ireland to choose to avail of that healthcare in another EU or EEA country or Switzerland.  Such patients are reimbursed to a maximum of the level of cost that would have been assumed if this healthcare had been provided in this jurisdiction. The care must be provided outside the State and may be availed of in the public or private sector. The CBD does not provide for the patient to access the care in his or her State of residence.</p><p>At present a national procurement process is underway to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for 4 years or longer. It is expected that this initiative will commence later this year and will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

They must however, comply with the European Communities (General Product Safety) Regulations which specify the duties of producers and distributors placing products on the market.</p><p>While e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, they do contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance which is the driver for cigarette smoking. Hence, there are legitimate concerns about the public health benefits of allowing such products to exist without regulation. Because they are a relatively recent product, there is limited scientific information available to balance the potential harms and benefits that might arise from more widespread public use.</p><p>The EU Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU), <i>inter alia,</i>provides for the regulation of certain aspects of e-cigarettes across EU Member States. My Department is working to transpose the Directive into national legislation by the May 2016 deadline. </p><p>The Directive will: </p><p>-  set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes;</p><p>-  make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory;</p><p>-  introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes; and</p><p>- impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  </p><p>In addition to the regulations under the Directive, e-cigarettes will be further regulated in Ireland through the introduction of a retail licensing system.  The legislation, approved by Government will also prohibit the sale of these products to, and by, persons under 18 years of age.</p><p>Currently the evidence base does not support prohibiting vaping in public places although individual organisations/companies are free to introduce an e-cigs free policy. My Department will continue to monitor evidence on the potential harms and any benefits of these products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area.</p></reply>

What I would say is that current best advice is that the diagnosis of Lyme Borreliosis should be made after careful evaluation of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.</p>  <p>  The general position regarding testing for Lyme Disease is that antibody testing is the mainstay of laboratory testing but these tests need to be performed by an appropriately accredited laboratory, ideally using validated  CE marked assays. In addition, international guidelines recommend a two-stage approach for serology testing. Samples are first screened using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Reactive results are further investigated using a second test, the immunoblot (Western Blot). It is possible to get a preliminary positive screening test (EIA) which is not confirmed when interpreted with the result of the second immunoblot test.</p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE has established a Lyme Borreliosis sub-committee of its Scientific Advisory Committee to consider methods to raise awareness and improve surveillance of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. Part of the committee's work will also be to undertake a survey of Borreliosis laboratory practice in Irish clinical laboratories which should provide valuable information on the manner in which Lyme testing takes place in Ireland.</p></reply>

There are currently 3 adrenaline autoinjectors authorised and marketed in Ireland. Brands include Anapen&reg;, Epipen&reg; and Jext&reg;.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there are shortages of supply of the adult preparations of all 3 brands at a wholesaler level. There may still be supplies within the system at a pharmacy level. Unfortunately, individual pharmacies and their patients may be experiencing difficulties.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has been working with the suppliers to try to restore continuity of supply. The HPRA employs a number of procedures which help to reduce the occurrence, impact and length of medicines shortages.  One such mechanism, used in the case of adrenaline autoinjectors, is to facilitate Batch Specific Requests (BSRs). BSRs enable the company to temporarily supply, essentially identical, medicines from other countries to the Irish market to alleviate shortages. BSRs are typically processed within 24 hours of submission by a company to the HPRA.</p>  <p>  I understand that the HPRA is working with the companies concerned to facilitate the provision of further stock in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Adrenaline autoinjectors are complex systems due to both the characteristics of the adrenaline active substance, which is chemically unstable, and of the delivery device, which is designed to be as patient friendly as possible. The manufacture of these products is also complex. For these reasons supply shortages can occur from time to time.</p>  <p>  The availability is also impacted by the shelf life of these 3 autoinjector products (which ranges from 18 to 24 months). This is short compared to some other medicinal products.</p>  <p>  The HPRA has recently granted a Marketing Authorisation (MA) for a fourth adrenaline autoinjector, Emerade&reg;. This has a 3 year shelf life. The HPRA is proactively working to ensure that supplies of this product can be made available as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  There is no franchise, per se, for supply of adrenaline autoinjectors in Ireland. Each of the 4 products referred to above is the subject of a separate MA, granted by the HPRA, which entitles the holder to place the product on the Irish market.</p></reply>

More recently I have signalled my intention to make legislative changes to allow for suitably trained non-medical persons to supply a range of prescription only medicines in very specific circumstances. These medicines include epinephrine injectors, salbutamol, glyceryl trinitrate, glucagon and naloxone.</p>  <p>  This is a significant change to existing regulations around the supply of prescription only medicines and officials from my Department have been working closely with colleagues from the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Health Products Regulatory Authority on the legislative changes necessary to allow for this. I expect this work to be completed in coming weeks.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. The information on waiting times for treatment for Quarter 2 of 2015 in the HSE West region is as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment </th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>25-48<br /><br />months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>No. of Patients</td><td>582</td><td>1,051</td><td>2,158</td><td>1,296</td><td>46</td><td>5,133</td></tr></table></p><p>The HSE has established a pilot scheme in Dublin North East which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists in the treatment of a number of eligible children. Consideration will be given to expanding this Scheme to other HSE areas in the future. In addition, a national procurement process is currently underway to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years. This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer. It is expected that this initiative will commence later this year and will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

The number of applications received to the end of August was up 122% on the same period in 2014.</p><p>As things stand, there are 2,313 open applications, of which:</p><p>- 1,632 have documentation outstanding (70%);</p><p>- decision letters have issued in 272 cases;</p><p>- 55 have been approved and a fee is awaited by the NMBI; and</p><p>- 205 are waiting review.</p><p>The applications that  have been submitted with incomplete documentation (70%) cannot be processed until full documentation has been supplied. For this reason a new helpline is being set up to assist people with their applications and deal with registration queries. An upgraded website is also being developed. The Department has approved the filling of 16 posts.</p><p>Seven adaptation programmes have been held for the nursing home sector since 2014 with two further programmes scheduled for this year, in order to allow overseas nurses to register in Ireland.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Intellectual Disability; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI scheme.  Under the LTI scheme, persons suffering from these prescribed conditions are provided free of charge with the drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances required for the specific treatment of those conditions. Drugs and medicines required for other associated conditions are not covered under the scheme.  </p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:-</p><p>- Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;</p><p>- An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p><p>- If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p><p>- If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;</p><p>- Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;</p><p>- A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.</p><p>In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living</p><p>- Laundry service</p><p>A person&rsquo;s financial assessment can be reviewed, at their request, if 12 months have passed since the initial financial assessment or the most recent review, or if the HSE is satisfied that there has been a material change to the person&rsquo;s financial circumstances.</p><p>The applicant&rsquo;s local HSE Nursing Homes Support Office will be able to provide further details in relation to the financial review process (HSE Nursing Homes Support Office, Oak House, Millennium Park, Naas, Co. Kildare.  Tel: 045 880400).</p><p>The specific issues raised in relation to the Long Term Illness Scheme are service matters and have been referred to the Health Service Executive for reply.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days will he please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Biosimilar medicines are similar but not identical to their reference biological medicines, and therefore are not considered in the same way as generic medicines.  Under the Heath (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, biosimilars are not considered to be interchangeable, and therefore cannot be substituted for biological medicines.</p>  <p>  It is likely that the use of biosimilar medicines will grow in Ireland in the coming years as the patents on biological medicines expire.

The PCT is the central point for service delivery which actively engages to address the medical and social care needs of the population in conjunction with a wider range of Network services.  PCTs comprise a range of healthcare professionals, including general practitioners; nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, social workers, health care assistants, home helps, managers and administrative staff.  Primary Care Networks provide additional resources depending on assessed needs, such as dieticians and psychologists, to a number of primary care teams.  Members of Teams and Networks liaise with fellow team members on an ongoing basis in the context of individual client cases.  </p>  <p>  I will arrange for the Deputy's correspondence to be forwarded to the HSE's National Director of Primary Care so that it can be considered in the context of the HSE's ongoing planning for the delivery of services to patients at community level.</p></reply>

The rationalisation of control rooms to one national centre on two sites, Tallaght and Ballyshannon, has now been completed.  On 2 September , the last remaining regional NAS control centre, Wexford, was successfully integrated into the new National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), the accredited centre of excellence in Tallaght.  The NEOC also houses the National Aeromedical Coordination Centre and the National Ambulance Service Training College. </p>  <p>  This project is delivering improved technology, to improve response times.  Developments such as national digital radio, computer-aided dispatch, mobile data and electronic patient care reporting will allow the NAS to deploy its resources more effectively and efficiently, and on a national basis rather than within small geographic areas.  The new single computer-aided dispatch system has now gone live.  This will transform the way the ambulance service is operated and emergency vehicles are deployed.</p>  <p>  Work is also underway with Dublin Fire Brigade on addressing the integration of ambulance call-taking and dispatch for the Dublin area and make best use of HSE and Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance resources in the region.</p>  <p>  A &euro;5.4m budget increase in 2015 is helping to address service gaps, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  Tuam and Mulranny ambulance stations are now operating on a 24/7 basis and discussions are underway concerning staffing of a newly refurbished facility at Loughglynn.  The number of community first response teams is expanding, with 132 teams now operating nationally.  On 14 July 2015, the Government agreed to establish the Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) Service on a permanent basis.  The EAS continues to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that all of these measures will further improve our ambulance service in 2015.</p></reply>

I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  </p><p>The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework that has been developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs contains a commitment to develop a plan for the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school and early years settings.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has recently concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  Work is ongoing to develop an appropriate model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with special needs in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has highlighted.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

The survey findings indicate that</p><p>-  Only 53% of respondents agree that people with a mental health difficulty are trustworthy.</p><p>-  67% agree that Irish people view people being treated for a mental health difficulty as a sign of personal failure.</p><p>-  Approximately 1 in 4 do not believe that Irish people would be willing to accept someone with a mental health issue as a close friend.</p><p>-  Only 21% believe that Irish employers would be comfortable employing someone with a mental health problem.</p><p>-  29% of respondents would not trust someone with a previous mental health difficulty to babysit.</p><p>These findings are very disappointing.  We are all aware of the stigma which is associated with having a mental health problem and that stigma can be the most damaging factor in the life of anyone who has a mental illness.  It is important, therefore, that we change our attitudes and our thinking about mental health and create an environment that recognises and treats people with mental health problems similarly to other health needs.  We need to foster a culture where people in difficulty, do not hesitate to seek help; a culture that recognises the signs and signals of distress and is willing to offer help, and one which embraces difference and excludes  stigma.</p><p><i>See Change</i>, the national mental health stigma reduction programme is working to change minds about mental health.  It is a community driven social movement to reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with mental health problems.  <i>See Change</i>is working with over 90 partner organisations, 200 volunteers and 60 campaign ambassadors and its work is supported by a strong evidence base.</p><p>Currently <i>See Change</i>activities include the Please Talk Programme &ndash; a student-focused, student-led mental health campaign in third level institutions; the Workplace Programme to address stigma in the workplace;  an Outreach Programme with Rural and Farming Communities; a Community Engagement Strand (volunteer programme, First Fortnight rural tour); and a Stigma Reductions Communications (Ambassadors Programme, Online and Social Media).</p><p>In tandem with the above stigma reduction is a key feature of <i>Connecting for Life </i>the new National strategy to reduce suicide. I would hope that these initiatives will help to bring about real change in our society and assist in reducing the stigma that is so often associated with mental health problems.</p></reply>

Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against legal and regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  In July 2014, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations were amended to allow for certain cannabis based medicinal products to be used in Ireland. Subsequently the HPRA granted a marketing authorisation for a cannabis based medicinal product which is indicated for the relief of certain symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep developments in relation to cannabis based medical products under review.

In 2015, there has been significant pressures on Emergency Departments, which may have resulted in rescheduling of routine procedures in some hospitals. All urgent procedures continue to be prioritised based on clinical need and all cancellations are rescheduled at the next available date.  </p>  <p>  In order to address pressure on EDs, I convened the ED Taskforce, which published a plan earlier this year, including a range of time defined actions to optimise existing hospital and community capacity, to develop internal capability and process improvement and to improve leadership, governance and oversight.  The implementation of this plan is a key focus for the HSE in 2015.  Improving waiting lists for scheduled care is also a key priority for Government. In January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, I put in place a maximum permissible waiting time for in-patient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end. Additional funding of &euro;51m has been provided this year to ensure that these maximum waiting times are achieved. In June, the HSE reported performance against the 18 month maximum waiting time of 99.6% for IP/DC and 92% for OPD.  In order to maintain progress and to make further improvements to achieve a 15 month maximum waiting time by end December, the HSE has directed that hospitals which breached the 18 month maximum waiting time in August are to be fined.  The fines will be calculated on the basis of the activity based funding cost of each procedure and are being imposed from 1 September.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-22a.2929.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092200113#WREEE01700"><p>Improving waiting lists for scheduled care is a key priority for Government.  In January, taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, the Minister for Health put in place a maximum permissible waiting time for in-patient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year end.  Additional funding of &euro;51m has been provided this year to ensure that these maximum waiting times are achieved.  </p>  <p>  In June, the HSE reported a performance against the 18 month maximum waiting time of 99.6% for IP/DC and 92% for OPD.  In order to maintain progress and to make further improvements to achieve a 15 month maximum waiting time by end December, the HSE has directed that hospitals which breached the 18 month maximum waiting time in August are to be fined. The fines will be calculated on the basis of the activity based funding cost of each procedure and are being imposed from 1 September.</p>  <p>  The HSE, in conjunction with Hospital Groups is focused on delivering these targets through maximising use of internal capacity within and across Hospital Groups in the first instance.  Hospitals have been requested to produce clearance plans in this regard.  The HSE has already put in place specific measures to address waiting lists more efficiently in collaboration with acute hospitals, the Special Delivery Unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  These include observation of the National Waiting List Protocol (2014), adherence to relevant HSE National Clinical Programme guidelines and prioritising day-of-surgery admission where clinically appropriate. </p></reply>

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. </p>  <p>  Following publication of the Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and the Medical Card Process Review in November 2014, Minister Varadkar and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs. These included changes to the governance and organisational structure of the medical card assessment function within the HSE to increase the focus on customer service in the assessment process. The HSE  has also taken steps to ensure greater interaction between the medical card central assessment office and the Local Health Office and/or Primary Care Team to see if there are further circumstances or needs that would support a medical card application, and to ensure that assistance is provided to meet the individual's needs as far as possible (where they don't have a medical card). </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold, where deemed appropriate. Where the HSE invokes discretion, they must do so in a consistent manner and are cognisant of the potential range of circumstances that might prevail in individual cases. The relevant factors in assessing undue hardship may require the HSE to take a number of issues into account and may require the applicant, or the HSE, on behalf of the applicant to interact with a number of sources to establish eligibility which may often be a timely process.  The HSE guidelines governing the application of discretion were developed to ensure that fairness and equity is applied to all applicants under these schemes in accordance with the legislation and endeavours to ensure that all persons who are entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card, are facilitated to avail of their entitlement. </p>  <p>  The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by about 76% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 92,000 at the end of August this year. </p>  <p>  Also as part of the reform, a Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established by the Director General of the HSE to provide clinical oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system. The Group is working on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions, so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them.  </p></reply>

I propose to take Questions 1159, 1160, 1162 and 1174 together.</p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme, which is at the heart of our foreign policy. &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; our policy for international development, sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, and reaffirms our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) on Official Development Assistance (ODA). We have stated clearly that we intend to make further progress on this commitment as our economic recovery consolidates.  </p>  <p>  In July, I led the Irish delegation to the Third International Conference on Financing for Development held in Addis Ababa Ethiopia.  The conference successfully concluded with the adoption of the &ldquo;Addis Ababa Agenda for Action&rdquo; which sets out in detail the financing needs for sustainable development for the next fifteen years.   In the run up to the Addis conference Ireland was instrumental in helping broker agreement among EU Member States, recommitting to the UN 0.7% target, and to ensuring that at least 0.2% of GNP is directed to Least Developed Countries as ODA, within the timeframe of the Sustainable Development Agenda, which runs to 2030.  The &lsquo;Addis Ababa Action Agenda&rsquo; specifically welcomed the decision by the European Union to affirm its collective commitment to those targets.  </p>  <p>  The Addis agreement, together with the very successful agreement at the UN on new Sustainable Development Goals, which will be formally adopted by world leaders in New York this week, and the agreement currently being negotiated under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), have the potential to transform the approach to sustainable development globally and end extreme poverty and hunger in our lifetime.   We are currently at an advanced stage of the 2016 Estimates process.  While final allocations for Budget 2016 are ultimately a matter for Government, I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I will be making the strongest possible case for an increase in the allocation to Official Development Assistance.</p></reply>

When I met with the Colombian Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms. Patti Londo&ntilde;o, in Dublin on 18 June 2015 I raised the human rights situation in Colombia with her, emphasising the importance Ireland places on protecting trades unionists, human rights defenders, journalists and others. I also raised a number of specific cases with the Vice-Minister.  Officers from our Embassy in Mexico regularly discuss human rights issues with government interlocutors during their visits to Colombia and meet with international and local civil society organisations working on human rights issues there, including on environmental rights. </p>  <p>  Irish Aid provides funding to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia which is specifically targeted to their work in the south-west of Colombia. The Embassy of Ireland in Mexico also oversees Irish Aid funding to a number of civil society organisations in Colombia, with a focus on the protection of human rights defenders and raising awareness of violations.  </p>  <p>  Human rights in Colombia are a major concern for the EU, including Ireland and other member states, and are addressed in detail in the context of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue. Through this mechanism, which addresses the subject directly with the Colombian authorities at official level, the EU engages in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including human rights defenders and trade unionists, prisoners, land restitution and environmental issues.  I believe that our policy of regular engagement, dialogue, and scrutiny within this structured framework is the best way to promote human rights in Colombia.</p>  <p>  The EU-Colombia/Peru Free Trade Agreement contains mechanisms for stakeholder consultation in relation to initiatives that could have consequences for labour and/or the environment. The implementation of the Agreement is overseen by a Trade Committee.  Officials from our Embassy in Mexico participated in a meeting of the Trade Committee in Bogot&aacute; in June 2015, at which questions of civil society participation, sustainable development, labour and environmental rights were discussed directly with Colombian and Peruvian officials. </p>  <p>  All of this engagement takes place in a difficult context.  Colombia faces a significant challenge in overcoming decades of violence.  Peace talks are continuing in Havana between the government and the main guerrilla organisation. </p></reply>

There remain significant concerns in relation to Iran&rsquo;s support for militant groups in the Middle East region, and human rights issues in Iran. These concerns have been spelt out in reports and resolutions at the UN General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, in bilateral contacts and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  The Iranian Government has made a number of positive statements on its intentions in relation to human rights issues since it took office in 2013.

The latest session of this dialogue took place on 8-9 December 2014 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment. The next round of the Dialogue is due to take place in November 2015, and this will allow the EU to raise matters of concern.  In 2013, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade held a series of meetings with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association and human rights lawyers.  During these meetings the Irish Falun Dafa Association discussed the issue of organ harvesting and ways in which human rights issues are raised with Chinese authorities by both Ireland and the EU. However, it should be noted that the Chinese Government denies accusations of human rights abuses against those who practice Falun Gong.  New laws on organ donation have come into force in China at the beginning of 2015 with a view to ending the practice of forced organ transplants, including from prisoners.  The Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, in cooperation with our EU partners, is monitoring the implementation of this new legislation.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels.</p></reply>

I addressed the NPT Review Conference on its opening day on the 27th of April in New York this year in order to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s continuing strong commitment to nuclear disarmament and met with a number of delegations on that occasion to consolidate and build support for our approach.  It is a matter of great regret that, despite strenuous efforts, including by Ireland, the 2015 NPT Review Conference ended without an agreed outcome document.</p>  <p>  Disarmament and non-proliferation remains one of Ireland&rsquo;s signature foreign policies, and I intend to continue working actively for the ultimate goal of a world free from nuclear weapons.  We work toward this goal with civil society groups, like minded nations, and particularly through our membership of the New Agenda Coalition (NAC), a cross-regional group of States which are committed to promoting urgent progress on nuclear disarmament. </p>  <p>  Since the NPT was signed in 1970, Ireland has emphasised the urgent need to pursue effective measures for nuclear disarmament.  The more we know about nuclear weapons, the more we understand that any detonation would be catastrophic in terms of environmental impact.  More importantly, it would create a humanitarian crisis beyond the capacity of the world to respond to. </p>  <p>  This summer marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, and the scenes of devastation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Ireland is part of the core group leading the humanitarian drive to ensure these weapons are never used again.  This drive has been given greater impetus by conferences on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons, each laying out the risks and consequences of even a limited nuclear exchange.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Humanitarian Pledge&rsquo;, endorsed at the Review Conference by 159 States, including Ireland, asserts that nuclear weapons must never be used again under any circumstances and that the only way of ensuring this is through their total elimination.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s final statement to the Review Conference recalled our commitment to nuclear disarmament and our belief that effective measures for the implementation of Article VI of the NPT are required as a matter of urgency.  Ireland will now pursue this commitment at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.</p></reply>

There are now more than 59 million people globally who have been displaced, more than at any time since the Second World War.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is firmly committed to responding to the humanitarian needs of those affected by these crises.  Since 2012, the Government has contributed over &euro;24 million in flexible funding to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, to support its critical work in safe-guarding the rights and well-being of refugees worldwide.  This is in addition to the targeted assistance Ireland provides in response to specific severe crises.  So far in 2015, our humanitarian support has reached people in South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, and Yemen, among other places. Ireland has a particular commitment to &lsquo;forgotten crises&rsquo;, which may not receive much media attention but where the humanitarian needs are chronic. </p>  <p>  Our most significant humanitarian contribution in recent years has been for people affected by the appalling conflict in Syria.  The ongoing war in Syria, which is now in its fifth year, has created the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis.  Some 240,000 Syrians have been killed, 7.6 million are displaced within Syria, and over 4 million have had to leave the country in search of safety.  Some 12.2 million people, over half of Syria&rsquo;s population, are in need of humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  Ireland is particularly mindful of the impact of the crisis on Syria&rsquo;s immediate neighbours &ndash; Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq &ndash; which have been generous hosts to hundreds of thousands of desperate people, putting huge strain on their own resources. </p>  <p>  We have been supporting efforts to assist refugees affected by the Syria crisis since 2012.  At the &ldquo;Kuwait III&rdquo; Pledging Conference in March 2015, Ireland pledged &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian crisis this year.  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;37 million in support for the Syrian people both within Syria and in neighbouring countries.  The fulfilment of our 2015 pledge will bring that total to &euro;41 million by the end of this year.  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian aid is implemented by our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners, and has helped to provide food, shelter and medical care to those who need it.  I am very conscious of the difficult living conditions of Syrian refugees and displaced people, and I am determined that Ireland will continue to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people over the next year. </p>  <p>  With so many humanitarian emergencies, of such size and severity, the effort to provide sufficient relief to those who need it has become an overwhelming global challenge.  The World Humanitarian Summit, which the UN Secretary General has convened for May 2016 in Istanbul, will examine how the world can respond more effectively.  Ireland is already playing a significant international role in preparing for this crucial Summit.</p></reply>

Ireland fully supports the removal of the terrorist threat posed by the ISIS group, consistent with international law.  Airstrikes have been conducted against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for a number of months.  It is for individual States to determine in what way they might best contribute to the concerted international effort underway to tackle the threat posed by ISIS and other fundamentalist jihadists.  I understand that the states involved in military action against ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria are acting at the request of the Iraqi government in the exercise of its inherent right to individual or collective self-defence pending action by the Security Council to restore international peace and security as recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and as notified by the US to the UN Secretary General on 23 September 2014.</p></reply>

As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement our overarching priority is to ensure its full implementation and to safeguard its institutions so that they can operate effectively and deliver for the people of this island.  This remains the best prospect for lasting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The functioning of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland is increasingly precarious.  Time is running out for the critical issues to be resolved and collapse of the Executive and Assembly averted. </p>  <p>  It was in this context that the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron called for all-party talks to be convened on Tuesday 8 September.</p>  <p>  These talks chaired by Secretary of State Villiers and I are focusing on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and the impact and legacy of paramilitary activity.  After an initially positive start, external developments, including those relating to the ongoing investigation into the murder of Mr. Kevin McGuigan, impacted on unionist engagement with the talks.</p>  <p>  There followed an intense few days of bilateral and trilateral meetings by both Governments with the aim of getting all parties back into inclusive substantive talks.  I am pleased to say that these efforts have been successful and talks in round table format resumed on Monday 21 September. </p>  <p>  At this stage in the process it is too early to speak about particular proposals which the Government might make.  Our focus for the coming weeks will be to support and assist the parties as they urgently get down to the serious business of fully implementing the Stormont House Agreement and addressing the impact and legacy of continuing paramilitary activity. </p>  <p>  An agreed outcome on these issues would be an important step forward - not just for politics on this island - but for the further normalisation of society in Northern Ireland and I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s continuing support in working to achieve this.</p></reply>

The agenda for the next Foreign Affairs Council has yet to be finalised.  Moreover, the situation is evolving rapidly, and there are to be special meetings of both the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Heads of State and Government today and tomorrow, respectively, to discuss the issues involved.  If migration is on the agenda, the Deputy can be assured that, for my part, I will actively participate in discussions at the EU Foreign Affairs Council, underlining the urgent need for the EU to do all it can to address the migration crisis in as comprehensive a manner as possible, as well as examining what more can be done to address its root causes.

However, in the same year 274 new services and 561 other service enhancements were approved by my Department - which added &euro;8 million to the cost of the scheme over a full year.  Most of the new services were introduced to cater for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the procurement of contractors to provide transport services under the School Transport Scheme.</p>  <p>  In this regard, Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the tendering procedure used by the Company for the provision of school transport services is a competitive procurement process conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under Directive 2004/17/EC.  Tenders are evaluated on the basis of the award criteria and scoring tables.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is satisfied that the current / Price / Quality ratio of 60% / 40% is appropriate for the school transport tender process.  Due to the nature, volume and complexities of the School Transport Scheme, there is a requirement to establish panels of suitably pre-qualified potential service providers in each School Transport local office so that they may be invited to tender for the provision of services on School Transport Scheme routes in an efficient and effective manner.  Five year contracts are awarded, providing additional security to contractors where previously contracts terminated at the end of each school year.  Qualification to each Panel each year is also for a 5 year period where heretofore it was for 1 year.  Each office follows the procedures set out by Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Procurement Department in the conduct of the tendering arrangements nationally.</p>  <p>  Almost 90% of the vehicles used to deliver school transport services are provided by private operators under contract to Bus &Eacute;ireann, which consist predominantly of smaller vehicles - and includes over 800 taxis.  Bus &Eacute;ireann uses large capacity school buses found mainly on services to primary and post primary schools.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet is also used as a safety net to maintain full service coverage and to provide a strategic balance between public and privately owned services on behalf of the State.</p>  <p>  The Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, conducted by an Inter-Departmental Committee and published in 2011, recommended that Bus &Eacute;ireann should continue to be the national organiser of the scheme and concluded that &ldquo;no existing organisation is operating in Ireland with the range of expertise in place, other than Bus &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  All Bus &Eacute;ireann buses and those owned by operators contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann are required to have a valid annual roadworthiness test certificate in order to be used to provide school transport services.  The inspections conducted by Freight Transport Association on behalf of the Company complement the annual statutory vehicle examinations as an additional measure designed to ensure that vehicles and maintenance records are maintained to appropriate standards, consistent with RSA guidelines, in the period between annual statutory tests taking place.  These vehicle inspections assess vehicle condition, safety, and maintenance standards of both Bus &Eacute;ireann buses and buses owned by private operators employed as Contractors to provide services under the School Transport Scheme.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport vehicles are generally maintained within a 20 year age limit and the Company is in the process of procuring an additional 20 school buses for delivery in 2016.</p></reply>

Subsequently, in July of this year, the Government approved proposals to offer <i>ex-grati</i>a payments up to a maximum of &euro;84,000 to those who initiated legal proceedings in cases of school child sexual abuse against the State but who subsequently discontinued their claims against the State where, similarly, the circumstances of the claims come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment and where the claims were not statute barred prior to the proceedings being discontinued.  To be eligible for the above settlement or payment arrangements cases must involve sexual abuse of a school child by a primary or second level school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority (including an authority of a school in which the teacher had previously taught), prior to the issue of the Department of Education guidelines to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively.

Where students do not qualify for free fees funding they must pay the appropriate fee - either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each higher education institution.  These institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees scheme is a matter for the relevant institution.</p><p>Due to concerns in relation to the fact that in some cases the higher non-EU fee was being charged to students who held EU/EEA/Swiss nationality but did not meet the residency clause for free fees, the Department requested higher education institutions to charge the more moderate EU fee to such students who have completed at least five academic years of study (primary or post-primary level) in Ireland/EU/EEA/Switzerland and commence their first undergraduate course of study in an approved institution here.  This position took effect from the previous academic year, 2014/15.  There are no plans to further amend this provision.</p></reply>

This group will provide a coordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models.</p><p>And secondly, the awarding of a grant of &euro;30,000, which will be provided by the HEA to the Union of Students' (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.

In terms of student sentiment, I welcome the findings that almost 8 in 10 (79%) college students now expect to find work in Ireland, up from (53%) in 2013. The survey has also found that less students expect to have to emigrate to find work and almost two thirds of students &quot;say they are looking forward to a bright future in Ireland after they finish 3rd level education&quot;.</p><p>  In terms of supports for students, the main support available is the student grant scheme. This scheme is primarily administered by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI). The purpose of the student grant is to contribute towards the maintenance costs associated with going to college where parental means are likely to be insufficient to meet those costs. Income thresholds are necessary to ensure that this support is properly targeted towards those who are most in need of this assistance. In the 2014/15 academic year the student support scheme provided assistance to over 80,000 further and higher education students. </p><p>  My Department also provides additional supports to students in higher education via the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund is managed by the Access Office in the Higher Education Authority. The objective of the Fund is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, because of financial reasons, suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third-level studies. The number of students who benefited from the fund in 2014/15 is not yet available however, in 2013/14 over 15,000 students received assistance. </p><p>  In addition to the supports provided by my Department, the option of tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on their website at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme have teaching resources and other funding allocated to them on a different basis from those schools that charge fees. </p><p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April of this year, prohibits the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions as part of the school admission process or for continued enrolment in the school. Exceptions are provided in the case of fees charged by schools known as fee charging schools, fees charged by boarding schools for the boarding element and fees charged by schools for post leaving certificate courses insofar as those fees relate to the cost of providing such courses. </p><p>  Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils in such recognised schools are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management; however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character. </p><p>  A school may seek payment to cover the cost of photocopied or other such learning materials where the amount sought by the school is consistent with the costs involved and the level of materials provided. It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate. No charge may be made, however, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p><p>  I believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities.  Better information for parents, including information in relation to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that I will be looking at in the context of the Department's work on developing plans for a Parents' and Students' Charter.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website www.education.ie, sets out my Department's policy in relation to the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme. The Circular explains that SNA support is not provided to pre-school services which operate outside of the primary or special school provision. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy however that the vast majority of supports for childcare, including pre-school education, is provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) currently provides for care support for pupils with special needs attending a range of HSE funded pre-schools.  As such, questions relating to provision of such services should be addressed to the HSE, or to my colleague, the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

Relatives of survivors of abuse are not eligible to receive support from Caranua. This approach was taken having regard to the maximum funds available of &euro;110 million and a potential pool of some 15,000 applicants.  I am satisfied that that approach was the correct one. This approach differs from that which applied in the case of the now dissolved Education Finance Board which was financed by the &euro;12.7 million contribution provided by the religious congregations under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement specifically earmarked for educational support for former residents and their families. </p>  <p>  As I explained to the Deputy in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions replies I intend to consider the question of a review of the arrangements relating to eligibility later this year by which time a clearer picture should have emerged regarding the uptake of the funding available.</p>  <p>  The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established pursuant to the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 to provide fair and reasonable financial awards to victims of institutional childhood abuse. The closing date for receipt of applications was 15th December 2005. The Board could however accept late applications in exceptional circumstances, up until September 2011. The Board is currently finalising the remaining applications it received and will be dissolved shortly thereafter. I do not propose to establish any further redress scheme for persons who may have suffered institutional abuse as children.</p>  <p>  Former residents who are not eligible for assistance from Caranua may be entitled to avail of services provided by other statutory bodies. Survivors can, for example, avail of the National Counselling Service operated by the Health Service Executive which offers counselling and psychotherapy services to those who have experienced trauma and abuse in childhood with priority given to survivors of institutional abuse.</p></reply>

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p><p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level and therefore the detailed information requested by the Deputies is not available centrally within my Department. </p><p>  The net reduction in guidance provision as a consequence of this budget measure was of the order of 500 posts. The annual budget saving from this measure is over &euro;30 million. This gives an indication of the cost involved if this budget measure was not in place. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.  This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support. </p><p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools. Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.</p><p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on &quot;wellbeing&quot; being studied by all pupils.</p><p>  I have no plans to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools. If economic recovery continues I hope the Government will be in a position to improve the standard staffing allocation to schools. However, I believe that it is desirable to give schools discretion on how to use those increased resources.</p><p>  Enhancing supports for schools, including guidance, are among a number of issues raised in discussion with me as priorities within the school sector. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60 million during 2015. </p><p>  I am determined that education should be prioritised for investment as our economy recovers and I will be seeking to agree a set of priorities for such increased investment into the future.</p></reply>

In this regard, the State Claims Agency (SCA) has made settlement offers in 7 of the 35 cases and has written to the other 28 litigants advising that the circumstances do not appear to come within the parameters of the judgement and inviting them to revert with any contrary evidence. Where a litigant does not accept the offer in settlement of his/her case or where the SCA is not satisfied that the case comes within the terms of the judgment, the case will proceed before the domestic Courts. </p><p>Subsequently, in July of this year, the Government approved proposals to offer ex-gratia payments up to a maximum of &euro;84,000 to those who initiated legal proceedings in cases of school child sexual abuse against the State but who subsequently discontinued their claims against the State where, similarly, the circumstances of the claims come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment and where the claims were not statute barred prior to the proceedings being discontinued.  It is not possible to assess at this stage how many cases in this category will satisfy these criteria. Persons who believe that their cases come within the criteria can contact the SCA and provide supporting evidence. Where there is a disagreement between the SCA and the individual as to whether their circumstances come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment, provision will be made for the application to be reviewed by an independent assessor.In cases where settlements are agreed, the State will pay, in addition to the settlement amount, such reasonable costs as agreed by the SCA. In the context of settling abuse victim compensation claims, the SCA has advised that it is not its practice to seek to impose a confidentiality clause on Plaintiffs in abuse related cases. In offering these settlements, the State will not be covering the liabilities of the perpetrators, school managers or patrons or other co-defendants.</p><p>To be eligible for the above settlement or payment arrangements, cases must involve sexual abuse of a school child by a primary or second level school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority (including an authority of a school in which the teacher had previously taught), prior to the issue of the Department of Education guidelines to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively. This rationale has been adopted as it is the basis of the ECtHR judgment. </p></reply>

Confirmation that a student is living separately from their parents/guardians is, of itself, not sufficient to establish independent status.</p>  <p>  When considering whether a student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, grant awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.</p>  <p>  For student grants purposes, a student may be assessed as an independent student if he/she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved post leaving certificate course or an approved higher education course or of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and is not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from the previous 1 October. Otherwise he/she would continue to be assessed on the basis of his/her parents' income. The awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof has been submitted by the grant applicant in establishing eligibility under all aspects of the scheme including independent residency.</p>  <p>  The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as requested by the relevant grant awarding authority. As such, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of all documents that would be acceptable to an awarding authority, as each individual's particular set of circumstances varies. However, the type of documentary evidence that would be required would include:</p>  <p> - a letter confirming that the applicant's address is registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board; or </p>  <p> - a Local Authority lease agreement or a letter confirming the applicant's rental under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS); or </p>  <p> - a letter confirming the receipt and period of rent or mortgage supplement; or </p>  <p> - a utility bill in the applicant's name, for example; landline telephone, fixed broadband, gas, electricity or cable/satellite television bill. If the utility bills in the household are in the applicant's spouse's name then they will be accepted along with a copy of the marriage certificate; or</p>  <p> - official documentation posted to the applicant at his/her address and relating to his/her residence there e.g. a letter from the Department of Social Protection confirming Rent Allowance at the address or a letter from a previous awarding authority.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant cannot provide any of the above, SUSI will work with the applicant to see what combination of evidence can be provided, and accepted, to satisfy the awarding authority that the applicant is living independently.</p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to their awarding body. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by their awarding body, and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grant Appeals Board.</p></reply>

If economic recovery continues I hope the Government will be in a position to improve the standard staffing allocation to schools. However, I believe that it is desirable to give schools discretion on how to use those increased resources.</p>  <p>  Enhancing supports for schools, including guidance, are among a number of issues raised in discussion with me as priorities within the school sector. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015.</p>  <p>  I am determined that education should be prioritised for investment as our economy recovers and I will be seeking to agree a set of priorities for such increased investment into the future.</p></reply>

Confirmation that a student is living separately from their parents/guardians is, of itself, not sufficient to establish independent status.</p>  <p>  When considering whether a student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, grant awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.</p>  <p>  For student grants purposes, a student may be assessed as an independent student if he/she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved post leaving certificate course or an approved higher education course or of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and is not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from the previous 1 October. Otherwise he/she would continue to be assessed on the basis of his/her parents' income. The awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof has been submitted by the grant applicant in establishing eligibility under all aspects of the scheme including independent residency.</p>  <p>  The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as requested by the relevant grant awarding authority. As such, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of all documents that would be acceptable to an awarding authority, as each individual's particular set of circumstances varies. However, the type of documentary evidence that would be required would include:</p>  <p> - a letter confirming that the applicant's address is registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board; or </p>  <p> - a Local Authority lease agreement or a letter confirming the applicant's rental under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS); or </p>  <p> - a letter confirming the receipt and period of rent or mortgage supplement; or </p>  <p> - a utility bill in the applicant's name, for example; landline telephone, fixed broadband, gas, electricity or cable/satellite television bill. If the utility bills in the household are in the applicant's spouse's name then they will be accepted along with a copy of the marriage certificate; or </p>  <p> - official documentation posted to the applicant at his/her address and relating to his/her residence there e.g. a letter from the Department of Social Protection confirming Rent Allowance at the address or a letter from a previous awarding authority.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant cannot provide any of the above, SUSI will work with the applicant to see what combination of evidence can be provided, and accepted, to satisfy the awarding authority that the applicant is living independently.</p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to their awarding body. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by their awarding body, and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grant Appeals Board.</p></reply>

These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools.</p>  <p>  An appeals process is also available to small schools. Details of the appeals criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems, behavioural emotional and social. </p>  <p>  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. </p>  <p>  Schools are assisted by Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2012), which was developed to implement Action 2.1 of Reach Out: the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 (HSE, 2005).</p>  <p>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in mental health promotion. They are also useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.</p>  <p>  It is also important that this message is conveyed to pupils at an early age.  To this end, Wellbeing Guidelines for Primary Schools have been recently produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in primary schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.</p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is "Well-being". It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including the key skills of "Managing Myself" and "Staying Well". In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others.</p>  <p>  One of the innovative features of the Junior Cycle Framework is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE, which may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three year cycle. The new short course is now available to implement in post-primary schools, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. It includes strands such as "Minding Myself and Others" and "My Mental Health", and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative, which is supported by the Department of Health. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being.</p>  <p>  All schools are required to develop and implement a Relationships and Sexuality (RSE) programme at junior cycle and senior cycle in post-primary schools. RSE includes the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, and the development of attitudes, beliefs and values about relationships, sexual identity and intimacy, and includes the topics of pregnancy, and unplanned pregnancy.</p></reply>

If they have assessed care needs they may be supported by a special needs assistant.</p>  <p>  In respect of children who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided. </p>  <p>  As such, a pupil may have access to a number of different placement options in a locality. However, the enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie. The SENO can also advise parents in relation to supports which may be available to support children with special educational needs, including special transport arrangements which may be made available.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School. This guide is also available at www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  Finally I wish to explain that, for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school, or for children with special educational needs for whom a school placement or preschool placement is not available, my Department provides a compensatory educational service through the Home Tuition scheme.

In addition to salary costs of teachers and Special Needs Assistants, my Department provides a range of additional funding for schools including provision for school buildings, transport, assistive technology support as well as enhanced capitation levels which are provided to special schools and special classes. </p>  <p>  Circular 40/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding for schools. The Circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities. However, there is no provision to ring-fence this funding for use otherwise, or for the purposes put forward by the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.

In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.

This is an important principle and will continue in the 2015/16 school year.  This increase in SNA posts is in addition to the additional 220 SNA posts for 2015 already provided for last autumn.  The overall result of this is that from September 2015 there will be 11,820 whole-time SNA posts available in our primary and post-primary schools. This is an 11.7% increase since this Government came to office.</p><p>I am also aware of concerns expressed by SNAs regarding the casualisation of SNA positions and in recent months my Department has also issued a circular regarding the employment of SNAs. (DES Circular 41/2015 &ndash; See attached link)</p><p>This Circular details the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 15/16 school year and also outlines that where a school/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours/posts, then that additional allocation of hours/posts must be offered to any existing part-time SNAs in that employment, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to recruitment.  This was done with a view to addressing the issue of casualisation of employment amongst SNAs.</p><p>This circular will go a long way to address concerns about casualisation that have arisen within the profession and which I addressed at the IMPACT education sector conference at Easter. This circular builds on the introduction of a supplementary assignment panel process for SNAs which was introduced two years ago, giving SNAs the alternative of redeployment instead of redundancy. Both measures have operated in advance of the 15/16 school year giving SNAs greater stability and a better chance of a full-hours contract.</p><p>The purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.  Furthermore, it means that, before an employer opts to recruit a further person as an SNA(s), they must ensure that all existing part-time SNAs in their employment, in order of seniority, have been offered a full-time position in the school or, in the case of ETBs, a full-time position in a school within the ETB scheme.</p><p>The only exception that can be made to this rule is where a school/ETB has a determination in writing from the NCSE / SENO stating that their allocation must be split amongst a specific number of SNAs and/or stating that the allocation must be implemented in a specific fashion to address the care needs of the pupil(s).  In cases where this exception is being invoked by a school/ETB then this written determination from the NCSE / SENO must be provided to the existing part-time SNA(s) affected.  It should also be noted that the position in relation to the allocation and distribution of Infant days, which is a distinct and specific feature of the SNA scheme, remains unaffected. </p><p>If an SNA believes that Circular 0041/15 regarding the allocation of extra hours to current SNAs was not adhered to in their school i.e. they were not furnished with information regarding either a written determination from the NCSE/SENO and/or the invocation of the Infant Days principle then they should contact the dedicated e-mail address snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie  and my officials will ensure that the relevant information regarding the matter is provided to them by their employer.</p><p>Finally, as already outlined, my Department has set up a dedicated e &ndash; mail address with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e &ndash; mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. It currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schoolsThe configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p><p>The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p><p>The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

The industry is seeking a reduction in motor tax for the sector, a change in the basis of taxation from unladen to gross design vehicle weight and the introduction of road user charging.  In relation to the latter two proposals, these are currently being considered and implementation, if recommended, would be for the medium to long-term.

My Department has made enquiries of Kilkenny County Council in relation to this matter and the Council have indicated that the Kilkenny Central Access Scheme &ndash; which provides for a new bridge crossing over the River Nore in Kilkenny City along approximately 600 metres of associated roadway - was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in December 2011.   </p>  <p>  The placement of stone in the River Nore to facilitate the construction works is provided for in An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s approval and in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) underpinning the Scheme. In this connection, the Council has advised that no unwashed limestone was placed in the River Nore as part of the works. All limestone used was washed twice before delivery to the works site.   </p>  <p>  The Council has further advised that all pre-works ecological reports made comment on the poor habitats and lack of aquatic life in the stretch of the River Nore where the Central Access Scheme works are being undertaken. These reports suggest that the relevant stretch of the River has been in a poor aquatic state for a number of years prior to the commencement of the works on the Central Access Scheme.   </p>  <p>  It is also understood that following a legal challenge, a High Court Order of 14 April 2015 determined that all works associated with the Kilkenny Central Access Scheme are compliant with the approval for the scheme. The October 2014 Aquatic Ecological Report referred to by the Deputy was taken into account in the determination of the High Court Order. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Council has advised that all in-river works have been undertaken in consultation with and under the direction of Inland Fisheries Ireland - as provided for in the approved EIS &ndash; who have monitored the work regularly. These works are now almost complete and, in accordance with the approval for the scheme, an ecological assessment will be conducted post completion of the works, which will be made available in due course.   </p></reply>

The vast majority of contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price. However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis. However, this information is commercially sensitive to each operator and is not available to my Department. </p><p>In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households. Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area. Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.</p><p>Among the measures included in the Government&rsquo;s waste policy, <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland</i>, which was published in July 2012, was the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to report to Government with options to minimise the impact of waste charges on low- income households. </p><p>The working group, which comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Finance; and the T&aacute;naiste's Office, submitted its second report to Government in July 2013. Government considered the report and, given the complexity of the issues involved, including the fact that the vast majority of households have moved away from local authority collection and have engaged private waste collectors on whom it would be difficult to impose any obligation to provide a waiver system, mandated the working group to continue to examine the issue, with a view to submitting a third report to Government in due course.</p><p>Given that the vast majority of local authorities no longer collect waste and that the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged and services offered vary across the country, it is becoming increasingly apparent that introducing a national waiver scheme in the context of an open market for waste collection is highly complex. </p></reply>

The intention is to help those most in need, hence the application of means testing to the schemes.</p><p>The income limits for the scheme were last amended in 2014 arising from the recommendations of a review group and I have no plans to revise them further.  A priority for the scheme is to spread the benefits as widely as possible and ensure fairness and value for money in their operation. The scheme is therefore more sharply focussed towards households with greatest needs, especially lower income households. The income thresholds considered when providing grant aid under the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability are as follows: </p><p><table><tr><th><b>Gross Maximum</b><b>Household</b><b>Income p.a.</b></th><th><b>% of</b><b>Costs available</b></th><th><b>Maximum Grant</b><b>Available</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>&euro;</b></td><td><b>%</b></td><td><b>&euro;</b></td></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;30,000 </td><td>95% </td><td>&euro;30,000 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,001 - &euro;35,000 </td><td>85% </td><td>&euro;25,500 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;35,001 - &euro;40,000 </td><td>75% </td><td>&euro;22,500 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;40,001 - &euro;50,000 </td><td>50% </td><td>&euro;15,000 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;50,001 - &euro;60,000 </td><td>30% </td><td>&euro;9,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;60,000 </td><td></td><td>No Grant  </td></tr></table></p><p>At local level, the detailed administration of these Schemes, including the assessment, approval and payment of individual grants to applicants, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p><p>In the administration of the scheme for eligible applicants, cooperative arrangements are operated between local authorities and key hospital contacts to facilitate early notification of those patients awaiting discharge.

For that reason, I increased the funding available for the schemes in 2015. At &euro;50.5 million, the funding I announced is an increase of some 10% on the funding that was available last year, supporting local authorities in delivering an increased level of service. I expect that some 8,000 households will benefit under the schemes in 2015.  My Department works with local authorities to ensure a full drawdown of their allocation. Through careful management of my Department&rsquo;s housing budget in 2014, additional funds were made available to local authorities with high levels of grant activity. I will be applying the same scrutiny to the capital budget for 2015 and, in the event of savings arising     these grants will be a priority for supplementary funding. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the grant measures are heavily subscribed and local authorities are prioritising applications based on need. My Department encourages local authorities to make every effort to keep the schemes open and to this end, approvals for grant commitments carried forward into 2016 can issue up to the value of 50% of their 2015 allocation. </p></reply>

Lottery funding is a limited resource utilised across a range of Government Departments and Agencies. National Lottery funding channelled through my Department&rsquo;s Vote currently supports a wide range of other worthy causes, including community groups and voluntary organisations. National Lottery funding is also distributed by other Departments to groups working in areas such as disability, health and sport.</p><p>It is important to note that, should National Lottery funding be re-allocated to the natural environment, corresponding reductions would be required in other areas which are currently in receipt of such funding, within my own Department and also potentially within other beneficiary Departments. Accordingly, re-allocation of funding to support the natural environment at the expense of one or more of these other sectors can only be undertaken following careful consideration. However, I intend to keep this matter under review as the budgetary situation improves in the years ahead.</p><p>In taking this view, I am conscious that the natural environment, uniquely amongst the broad range of areas funded by my Department, also receives funding from the Environment Fund, which was established under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001. The Environment Fund comprises of the revenues from the environmental levy on the supply of plastic bags, collected by the Revenue Commissioners, and the environmental levy on the landfilling of waste, collected by local authorities. </p><p>The Environment Fund is used for activities or initiatives in a range of areas such as, <i>inter alia, </i>schemes to prevent/reduce waste and waste recovery activities; research &amp;amp; development into waste management; support of education and training and promotion of awareness of the need to protect the environment, including national and regional campaigns; and initiatives undertaken by community groups and others for protection of the environment.</p><p>From 2011 to 2014, in excess of &euro;255 million was disbursed to the environment sector from the Environment Fund. This is in addition to some &euro;146 million provided to the environment sector by way of Exchequer Voted expenditure by my Department. In 2015, I made Fund allocations totalling &euro;825,000 to the Irish Environmental Network and the Environmental Pillar. The total allocations from the Fund in 2015 amount to in excess of &euro;44 million.</p></reply>

Prior to its conclusion, arrangements were put in place for the transfer of the main elements of the campaign website, Change.ie, to the Irish Library Council website. The website now redirects to a dedicated section on climate change on the website.</p><p>Climate Change is also covered extensively in the energy theme of the Green Schools Scheme which receives funding from my Department.  My Department also provides funding for a Climate Change Award under the Tidy Towns Competition. </p><p>I believe that engaging the public and stakeholders at key points in the development of climate policy and legislation also contributes significantly to raising awareness of the challenge of climate change and allows the public and stakeholders the opportunity to make their contribution to this important matter. </p><p>In this context, my Department proposes, in collaboration with the Department of Education and Skills and the EPA, to launch next month a logo design competition for the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) that will be aimed at primary school students. This competition will be an opportunity for primary schoolchildren across Ireland to showcase their imagination and design talents and to inform themselves of the role that they can play in helping Ireland to contribute to meeting the global challenge of Climate Change.</p><p>I also launched a public consultation in June 2015 on the development of a low carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan (NMP) - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low-carbon transition agenda to 2050. My Department received 50 submissions which are currently being analysed and which I propose to publish on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly. I will also be seeking the views of stakeholders and the general public on a Scoping Report on the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the NMP. The purpose of the scoping report is to provide preliminary information on the proposed NMP, with a view to establishing the scope, level of detail and approach required for the associated SEA.</p><p>My Department is also currently finalising <i>Local Authority Adaptation Strategy Guidelines</i>, which will provide local authorities with detailed guidance on drafting their own local climate change adaptation strategies. Prior to publishing the Guidelines, my Department intends to hold a number of workshops across the country to build capacity among local authority staff to use the Guidelines correctly and also to raise awareness at local authority level of the important role that they need to play in Ireland&rsquo;s adaptation to the effects of Climate Change.  </p><p>My Department is also assisting EPA with the development of the Climate Ireland web platform. Climate Ireland will be a one-stop, web-based resource of climate and adaptation information for Ireland with the specific purpose of facilitating decision-makers at local and sectoral levels in planning for climate change adaptation. It will also be a useful general climate awareness tool and will be accessible to the general public via .</p><p>In terms of future initiatives, in the context of the development of NMP, the key issue of the role of behavioural change in the low-carbon transition process will be addressed and the need to conduct further climate awareness campaigns will be considered.  I am also looking at opportunities to raise awareness of COP21, to take place in Paris at the end of this year, where the 192 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change will meet with the aim of agreeing a new global, legally binding treaty on climate change. </p></reply>

The EU Regulations provide for a minimum allocation of 5% for LEADER of the EU element of the Programme at a co-financed rate of 80%. This would have given an allocation of &euro;136.8 million.  This Government has increased the minimum allocation to 7% and will co-finance it at 37% giving a total of &euro;235 million, made up of &euro;148.05m in EU funding and &euro;86.95m in national funding. Two Agri-Food schemes with a budget of &euro;15 million will also be delivered using the LEADER approach bringing the total programme complement to &euro;250m.   </p>  <p>  In determining the county allocations, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable level of funding.  Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the LEADER elements of the RDP 2014-2020. On this basis, County Kerry received an overall allocation of just over &euro;10.2m.   </p>  <p>While the allocation for the LEADER element of the 2014-2020 Programme is less than the value of the LEADER element of 2007 &ndash; 2013 programme, I am confident that within the confines of the fiscal environment we have experienced in the recent past, the Government has allocated the maximum amount possible to support the LEADER elements of the 2014-2020 programme.     </p></reply>

The CER has a statutory responsibility under the Water Services Act 2014 to provide a complaints resolution service to Irish Water customers with an unresolved dispute with Irish Water.

However there is currently a civil remedy available concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property.  The previous Minister of State for Housing and Planning wrote to the Minister for Justice in June 2012 to explore the possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties. In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. </p><p><b></b>The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012 suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation &ndash; which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes - rather than through the Courts. In this regard, I understand that the Minister for Justice proposes to publish a Mediation Bill later in 2015. Such mechanism, when introduced, should assist in <i>speeding up the resolution of civil disputes of this nature, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.</i></p></reply>

The aim of SICAP is to reduce poverty, promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.</p><p>The programme&rsquo;s target groups are children and families from disadvantaged areas, lone parents, new communities (including refugees and asylum seekers), people living in disadvantaged communities, people with disabilities, Roma, the unemployed (including those not on the Live Register), travellers, young unemployed people from disadvantaged areas and young people (aged 15-24) who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs)<i>.</i></p><p>SICAP is one of my Department&rsquo;s key priorities and is operating for a 9 month period for 2015, with funding of &euro;28 million. This includes an allocation of &euro;2 million under the European Structural Funds (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020 and &euro;2 million under the Youth Employment Initiative.</p><p>The objective of the SICAP activities proposed for ESF funding is to support young people who are at a higher risk of social exclusion with a particular focus on those from disadvantaged communities and from target groups that have been prioritised as experiencing higher risk of social exclusion, to improve work readiness and access to employment including through the provision of educational supports.</p><p>SICAP is being overseen and managed by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area. Each LCDC is mandated with bringing a more joined-up and coherent approach to the local management of public-funded programmes in the areas of economic, social and community development. The primary means through which this will be achieved will be the development and implementation of the community elements of the Local Economic and Community Plans, which are currently being developed in each Local Authority (LA) area. These plans will look to coordinate the delivery of community supports within their area.</p><p>During 2015, some 4,000 young unemployed people nationally will be supported through a range of defined activities under the programme, including training, job preparation/job search, work placements and mentoring.</p></reply>

The Private Security Authority (PSA), under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality, is responsible for the licensing, control and supervision of all installers of security equipment. The PSA has powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms. As of 1 August 2006, alarm installers cannot legally operate without a PSA licence, the granting of which requires that the installer is compliant with the Irish Standard for intruder alarm systems, IS EN50131. While this standard does not specify a maximum decibel level, it does specify a maximum duration of 15 minutes for the sounding of external alarms on buildings, which must cease automatically after this maximum duration. This applies to all external alarms installed after 1 August 2006.</p><p>The <i>Programme for Government</i>includes a commitment to take further steps to address noise pollution, <i>inter alia</i>, through consideration of the introduction of fixed payment notices (also known as on-the-spot fines). The development of new noise legislation by my Department is being considered in the context of this commitment. However, as indicated in the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme, it is not possible at this time to indicate when such a Bill might be published, having regard to the broad range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department&rsquo;s remit.</p><p>In the meantime, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992. This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.</p></reply>

My Department operates certain funding programmes to support local authorities in the development and improvement of social housing, including improving energy efficiency. Over the years 2004 to 2009, this included support for local authorities to carry out an extensive central heating upgrade programme in social housing, which saw the installation of central heating, and associated energy efficiency measures, in 27,750 such dwellings, at a cost to the exchequer of &euro;140 million. My Department is not currently operating any programme to remove solid fuel cookers and heating systems in existing social houses.   </p>  <p>  Local authorities are currently undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting on the least energy efficient social houses, with &euro;77 million funding support being provided by my Department over the period 2013-201 5. To date this has resulted in improved comfort levels and Building Energy Ratings in over 30,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the construction of new social housing, cost effective compliance with the current Building Regulations necessitates the use of high efficiency or renewable heating systems such as gas or oil fired condensing boilers. Whilst solid fuel stoves may, with expensive compensatory measures be used, value for money considerations together with proper regard for the health of children and the elderly in terms of outdoor air pollution would preclude use of this form of heating. The high standards of insulation achieved in new homes, compliant with the Building Regulations, will reduce the cost of water and space heating required in a three bedroom home to about &euro;470 per annum, thus reducing the dependency on solid fuel stoves.   </p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. The NPPR Charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment. </p><p>A number of exemptions from the charge are set out in section 4 of the 2009 Act and section 4(6) provides for an exemption from the charge in a situation where a residential property is occupied rent-free as the sole or main residence of a relative of the owner and the sole or main residence of the owner is either on the same property or within two kilometres of it.</p><p>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases.</p><p>The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application of the Charge in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority; Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge.</p></reply>

The Strategy targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme. This will address the needs of all households on the housing waiting list, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  The Strategy also includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the Summary of Social Housing Assessments by undertaking it on annual basis from 2016 onwards, which will support the continuous monitoring of social housing delivery against need.</p><p>On 1 April 2015, I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities, to meet an ambitious delivery target of 22,882 social housing units out to 2017. Details of the individual targets set for local authorities can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>. </p><p>To date in 2015 some &euro;493 million has been allocated, to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, for the construction and acquisition of over 2,900 units, full<b></b>details of which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: </p><p>.</p><p>In addition, over &euro;91 million worth of housing investment, across a range of housing schemes to bring vacant social housing units back into productive use and to improve housing for people with disabilities, as well as retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency, was announced in May 2015. Full details of the allocations made to local authorities are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Further announcements, in relation to project approvals, in line with the Strategy targets, will be made in due course.</p><p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), a key component of the Strategy, is also progressing at pace, with almost 4,000 households now in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme. HAP is now available to all qualified households in 13 local authority areas. Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP in the coming months. </p><p>With regard to financial initiatives, the Strategy includes a commitment to commence work on a financial vehicle, to be known as the Strategic Housing Fund, to raise funding for the social housing sector.  Work on the development of this new funding model has commenced and is being progressed under the Finance Work Stream of the Strategy&rsquo;s governance structure. This group, which has been put in place to develop the financial aspects of the Strategy, is chaired by my Department and comprises a range of key stakeholders including the Housing Finance Agency, the National Development Finance Agency and the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform.</p><p>Arising from the opportunity offered by the Strategy, a range of developers, investors, financiers and others expressed interest in being involved in the provision of social housing. A protocol was put in place in March 2015 under the auspices of the Finance Work Stream to facilitate individuals and entities seeking to engage with the State to provide investment for the delivery of social housing. A single point of contact for submitting proposals, the Social Housing Proposals Clearing House Group has been established, operating through my Department, under the oversight of the Finance Work Stream.  Interested parties may contact the Clearing House at <i>.</i></p><p>The Strategy also provides for a &euro;300 million programme of investment in social housing via the Public Private Partnership model, which is expected to deliver 1,500 housing units; work is advancing with site selection well underway.</p><p>Finally, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, a key deliverable for my Department under <i>Construction 2020</i>, was commenced with effect from 1 September 2015. The Act revises Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing to maximise the opportunity for the delivery of social housing units and also secure the principle of integrated mixed tenure developments. Importantly, the practice of developers making cash payments in lieu of housing units is no longer an option under the new legislation.</p></reply>

Dublin City Council is also implementing the HAP pilot scheme for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities. To date, there are almost 4,000 households supported by HAP across these local authority areas. Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP in the coming months.  On 16 December, 2014, I issued a statutory direction to all authorities involved in the HAP statutory pilot, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  I also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.  As of 31 August 2015, 17 households had transferred from HAP to other forms of social housing support.   </p></reply>

Stage one is complete but stage two is still on-going and therefore no entity has been selected to deliver LEADER in any area.  Under stage one of the selection process, any entity who wished to be considered as a Local Action Group was invited to submit an expression of interest (EOI). For the purposes of the new programme, there are 28 sub-regional areas in Ireland and 45 separate expressions of interest were received. A single expression of interest was received in 19 of the 28 areas and at least two expressions of interest were received in the remaining nine areas. Following a number of facilitated meetings the number of areas with multiple EOI&rsquo;s has reduced to six and the current position is set out in the Table below. </p><p>All applicants have been given a minimum of 6 months for the preparation of Local Development Strategies. I expect that not all areas will require the full 6 months and I am hopeful that many areas will have their strategies submitted, assessed and approved and be in a position to begin implementing their strategies by Autumn 2015. </p><p>In areas where a single strategy is submitted, an Independent Evaluation Committee will review and evaluate these strategies with a view to ensuring that they meet the required standard. </p><p>In areas where entities do not come to an agreement and multiple strategies are submitted, it will be a matter for the Independent Evaluation Committee to make a decision on which Local Development Strategy best meets the needs of the community. In this situation, the Evaluation Committee will not make a decision on the successful strategy until all strategies for that sub-regional area have been submitted for assessment. <table><tr><th>Sub- Regional Area </th><th>Expression of Interest </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>Carlow LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>Cavan Leader (LCDC) </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>Clare LCDC </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clare Local Development Company </td></tr><tr><td>North Cork </td><td>North Cork LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>South Cork </td><td>South Cork LCDC </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>South &amp;amp; East Cork Area Development Partnership Ltd </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>West Cork Development Partnership (Macroom Area)* </td></tr><tr><td>West Cork </td><td>West Cork LCDC </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>West Cork Development Partnership* </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>Donegal LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>Dublin Rural LAG </td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>Galway LCDC </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FORUM Connemara Ltd </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>Kerry LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>County Kildare Local Action Group ( Kildare LCDC / County Kildare LEADER Partnership) </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>Kilkenny LCDC </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilkenny LEADER Partnership </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>Laois LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>Leitrim LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>Limerick LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>Longford LCDC in partnership with Longford Community Resources </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>Louth LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>Mayo LCDC </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Moy Valley Resources </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>IRD Kiltimagh </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>Meath LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>Monaghan LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>Offaly LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>Roscommon LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>Sligo LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>Tipperary LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>Waterford LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>Westmeath LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>Wexford LCDC </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>County Wicklow LCDC/County Wicklow Partnership </td></tr></table></p><p>*West Cork Development Partnership has been requested to decide which area it wishes to develop an LDS for. </p></reply>

Responsibility for replacing lead pipes or fittings within the property boundaries, including within the house itself, therefore rests with the homeowner. In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and in private ownership should be replaced over time. The joint position paper also recommends that persons in premises with lead piping should, in the meantime, flush the supply at the kitchen tap first thing in the morning, before using. The full document is available to download from the HSE&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>.</p><p>On 9 June 2015, I announced a Government-approved National Strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water. The Strategy was prepared by my Department and the Department of Health in consultation with Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA, in order to map the scale of the problem and identify measures to mitigate any risks to human health posed by lead in drinking water. As part of the Strategy , I will be establishing a new grants scheme to assist low income households to replace lead pipes in their homes.  Funding for the scheme will be finalised in the context of Budget 2016 and it is envisaged that the scheme will be administered by the local authorities . Income thresholds and other eligibility criteria will apply and the terms and conditions of the new scheme will be publicised as soon as they are finalised.</p></reply>

In both the private and goods vehicle categories, there is a low rate of tax designed to incentivise the use of electric vehicles (&euro;120 and &euro;92 per annum, respectively). Otherwise, private vehicles registered prior to 2008 are taxed on the basis of engine capacity and private vehicles registered thereafter are taxed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions. Goods vehicles are based on the unladen weight of the vehicle.  A series of EU directives provide the minimum environmental standards for exhaust emissions of new vehicles sold in EU member states, and these are becoming increasingly more stringent with each iteration. Ireland is bound by the terms of such Directives. The transposition of the Directives into national law, where appropriate, is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

Furthermore, it is not possible for a household on the waiting list of one housing authority to transfer its application to another authority and to carry the time spent on the previous list.  In respect of applicants in Dublin, Cork and Galway it is possible for a qualified household, once entered on the waiting list of one authority in the County, to also be entered simultaneously on another authority&rsquo;s waiting list within the same County. In Cork and Galway this allows applicants to be simultaneously on the City Council and County Council waiting lists.

In areas where entities do not come to an agreement and multiple strategies are submitted, it will be a matter for the Independent Evaluation Committee to make a decision on which Local Development Strategy best meets the needs of the community. In this situation, the Evaluation Committee will not make a decision on the successful strategy until all strategies for that sub-regional area have been submitted for assessment.</p></reply>

Such a notice may direct the occupier to take such measures as the authority specifies in order to prevent or limit air pollution. It is a matter for the local authority to exercise its judgment in any individual case as to whether a nuisance is being caused, and what abatement action may be required.</p>  <p>  I am currently in the process of enhancing the powers of local authorities in this matter.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the competent authority for the implementation of the Directive in Ireland designated four zones which were originally designated in the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011. The zones were subsequently amended on 1 January 2013 to take account of population counts from the 2011 Census.</p><p>The main areas defined in each Irish zone are:</p><p>- <i>Zone A</i>: Dublin</p><p>- <i>Zone B</i>: Cork</p><p>- <i>Zone C</i>: Other cities and large towns including Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Drogheda, Dundalk, Bray, Navan, Ennis, Tralee, Kilkenny, Carlow, Naas, Sligo, Newbridge, Mullingar, Wexford, Letterkenny, Athlone, Celbridge, Clonmel, Balbriggan, Greystones, Leixlip and Portlaoise.</p><p>- <i>Zone D</i>: Rural Ireland, i.e. the remainder of the State excluding Zones A, B and C.</p><p>Upper and lower assessment thresholds are prescribed in the legislation for a number of pollutants. Within each zone, air quality is assessed and classified with respect to these thresholds, based on measurements over the previous five years. The results of this assessment help to inform decisions on the extent of monitoring. The greatest monitoring effort applies where concentrations are above the upper assessment threshold, i.e. where they approach or exceed the limit value. Where concentrations are between the two thresholds, less intensive measurement combined with other assessment methods, such as air quality modelling, will generally suffice. Monitoring sites are located in accordance with CAF&Eacute; Directive requirements. </p><p>In relation to mobile monitoring, the EPA currently possesses three units. Two of these units are used for assessment and reporting purposes in accordance with the Directive. These are mainly used for assessing air quality in Zone C towns but on occasion have been used in other zones as required. The units usually monitor for a period of 1 &ndash; 2 years at any one location before being re-assigned to a new location. The stations are equipped with monitors for carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter.</p><p>The monitoring units have been recently used in a number of locations including Mullingar, Newbridge, Letterkenny and Shannon and are currently located in Portlaoise and Enniscorthy. The assessment reports for monitored locations, including near real-time air quality information, are available on the EPA website.</p><p>In addition to the two monitoring units referred to above, the EPA has recently acquired a third mobile monitoring unit for use in emergency air quality incidents.</p></reply>

This approach to ensuring households in the group water sector receive equivalent support, while allowing for any transitional issues, to sustain improvement in quality in the sector, was reiterated on 19 November 2014, following a review of the water charging regime undertaken by the Government, the outcome of which was the announcement of a revised charging system for Irish Water customers. </p><p>Following completion of the review of the subsidisation of group water schemes the following revised subsidies are operative with effect from 1 January 2015;</p><p>- Subsidy A towards the general operational and management costs of group schemes served from a public source is &euro;40 (down from &euro;70);</p><p>- Subsidy A towards the general operational and management costs of group schemes served from a private source is &euro;95 (down from &euro;140); and</p><p>- Subsidy B towards the operational and maintenance costs associated with &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; Design Build Operate contracts for schemes which have their own water treatment facilities remains unchanged at &euro;220. </p><p>The revised subsidies represent fair treatment between drinking water consumers in the public and group sectors having regard to the inherent differences in structure, funding and organisation between the sectors.</p><p><i>The annual savings from the introduction of the changes in subsidies are currently estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.2 million. This amount is based on the number of houses for which Subsidy A was recouped to local authorities in 2014 qualifying for the full new subsidy amounts in 2015. However, this amount is likely to vary as some houses may not qualify, on the basis of incurred expenditure, for the full subsidy amount. In addition, the number of schemes applying for subsidy may vary from year to year. It is not possible at this stage, therefore, to indicate what the savings in 2015 will be.</i></p><p>To promote sustainable use of water and to enhance water conservation in households, the Department of Social Protection is administering, on behalf of my Department, a &euro;100 water conservation grant for households (primary dwellings) that completed a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process by 30 June 2015. This grant also applies in the case of group water scheme households.</p><p>The Government remains committed to continuing to support the group water sector as an important element of the water industry in Ireland, founded on co-operative community and voluntary engagement, and to invest in the sector to sustain and improve quality standards and performance.</p></reply>

The Strategy is a comprehensive response to the need for social housing and targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme. This will address the needs of the households on the housing waiting list with flexibility to meet potential future demand.</p><p>Under the Strategy, on 1 April 2015, I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities, to meet an ambitious delivery target of 22,882 social housing units out to 2017. Details of the individual targets set for local authorities can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at:.</p><p>To date in 2015 some &euro;493 million has been allocated, to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, for the construction and acquisition of over 2,900 units, full<b></b>details of which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p>.</p><p>Furthermore, over &euro;91 million worth of housing investment, across a range of housing schemes to bring vacant social housing units back into productive use and to improve housing for people with disabilities, as well as retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency, was also announced in May. Full details of the allocations made to local authorities are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:.</p><p>Further announcements in relation to project approvals, in line with the Strategy targets, will be made in due course.</p><p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is also progressing at pace, with almost 4,000 households now in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme. HAP is now available to all qualified households in 13 local authority areas. Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP in the coming months.</p><p>In relation to homelessness, a range of specific measures are being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness. These measures have been identified in the Government's <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness </i>(May 2014) and in the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>(December 2014).</p><p>Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform. The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>These Plans represent a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with homelessness and the implementation of measures identified in these plans is being overseen by a group of senior officials drawn from key State agencies concerned including my Department; the Departments of Social Protection; Health; and Children and Youth Affairs; the Health Service Executive; Tusla (the Child and Family Agency); the Irish Prison Service; and local authorities. </p><p>In addition to ensuring that appropriate emergency responses are put in place, it is of critical importance that steps are taken to prevent, as far as possible, families presenting as homeless in the first instance. In that regard, I am determined to achieve stability and sustainability in the private rental market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole. The regulation of rent raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike.  Ultimately, any decision in relation to rent certainty is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring proposals to Government for consideration as soon as the necessary preparatory work has been completed.</p><p>Finally, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, was recently enacted and was commenced with effect from 1 September 2015. The Act revises Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing to maximise the opportunity for the delivery of social housing units and to secure the principle of integrated mixed tenure developments. Importantly, the practice of developers making cash payments in lieu of housing units is no longer an option under the new legislation.</p></reply>

IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon </p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role a statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) on Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct stocks are carried out every year, with IFI engaged in an extensive monitoring of stock status which feed into the scientific committee's annual reviews.</p>  <p>  The scientific committee estimates the number of salmon likely to return to each river in the next fishing season based on estimates of salmon runs over the most recent five years. Each river has an individual conservation limit (CL) which is essentially the number of salmon required to spawn to maintain a healthy population. If the estimate of returning salmon is above this limit then salmon from that individually genetic river population may be harvested commercially or by rod and line. </p>  <p>  For rivers, such as the Suir, Nore and Barrow, where a counter is not in use, the primary index for evaluation of likely returning numbers is the recorded rod (harvest or catch and release) and commercial catch averaged over the previous 5 years. The scientific committee applies a range of rod exploitation rates for recreational fishing activity and adds the commercial catch to calculate the total run of salmon. In the case of the River Slaney, the fish counter data is used to estimate the salmon run. </p>  <p>  In addition, information on juvenile abundance indices derived from electro-fishing surveys carried out annually by IFI is also evaluated as an indicator of stock status. This information is used primarily where new information has not been available for rod catches.</p>  <p>  Harvest fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river. I am advised by IFI that a Risk Analysis is undertaken on any estimate of returns expected to be above the conservation limit. </p>  <p>  IFI have confirmed that, using the recorded salmon rod catch and any commercial salmon catch, the estimate of returning salmon in 2015 was below the individual conservation limits for the rivers Barrow, Nore and Suir and no surpluses of salmon was available. No salmon surplus was also available using fish counter data for the Slaney averaged over the past five years.</p>  <p>  I am informed that IFI is currently investigating the possibility of installing a fish counter on the river Barrow for salmon stock assessment. This process will depend on locating a suitable site and acquiring all planning and other relevant permissions. </p>  <p>  The salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland is considered internationally as best practice with many other countries moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.</p>  <p>  As regards the issue off salmon hatcheries, IFI have advised that there are significant genetic and ecological concerns when the progeny of wild salmon reared in a hatchery environment are released back into the wild and guidelines have been prepared by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with regard to applying the precautionary approach to any proposed stocking of hatchery reared Atlantic salmon into the wild.</p>  <p>  There are many possible causes for decline of Atlantic salmon populations and stocking may not be an appropriate solution. IFI&rsquo;s advice for enhancement of salmon stocks nationally, including the River Nore, is to continue with single stock salmon management to achieve individual river spawning targets while also supporting habitat enhancement and removal of artificial barriers to migration rather than artificial stock enhancements which have potentially detrimental genetic impacts. </p></reply>

The salmon conservation limit (CL) is the number of spawning salmon required to maintain a sustainable population and is used to indicate the number of salmon in a river system above which a harvestable surplus can be considered. Salmon conservation limits are set similarly for all of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers.</p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by the statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) on Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. IFI also carries out extensive monitoring of salmon stock status which feed into the scientific committee's assessments carried out every year. </p>  <p>  The Barrow, Nore and Suir are the three main contributing rivers to Waterford Estuary. The SSC advice for 2015 is that the Nore had a deficit of 897 salmon below CL, the Suir had a deficit of 2762 salmon below CL and the Barrow had a deficit of 9720 salmon below CL. All three rivers remain closed for harvesting of salmon. The opening of a commercial salmon fishery can only be considered if there is a suitable surplus of salmon (in excess of conservation limit) available for harvest.</p>  <p>  Prior to any commercial salmon fishing being permitted in the Waterford Estuary it will be necessary for all the waters in the vicinity of the fishing location to be in surplus at the same time and for genetic analysis to confirm that no other stocks are mixed in the area. If genetic assessment proves that the stocks in the area are specific to local rivers only, and that analysis shows that these stocks are all above their conservation limit with a surplus available for exploitation, consideration could be given to a commercial fishery. </p>  <p>  Any future decision on a fishery can only be taken in this context and Ireland must be particularly careful to ensure that all national and international legislation and other obligations are met in any future management regime. </p>  <p>  I am advised by IFI that all three rivers are currently below their individual conservation limits and therefore there is no permitted salmon /sea trout fishery in the common estuary.</p>  <p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008 and I understand that all funds were expended and there are currently no plans to revisit such a scheme.</p></reply>

The primary objective in introducing a Public Service Broadcasting Charge is to secure a more stable funding stream for public service broadcasting than the current TV Licence system provides in light of the current high level of evasion and the impact that technological developments are having on the way that media is consumed. </p>  <p>  In terms of the introduction of any new charge, in my statement of 21 April 2015 on the publication of the NewERA and Indecon reports, I indicated that I had advised Government that it would not be possible to replace the TV licence fee with a public service broadcasting charge within the lifetime of this Government. I also pointed to the need to build public understanding and support for the introduction of such a charge. </p>  <p>  In terms of funding for community broadcasters, a proportion of the television licence fee monies are already being made available to commercial and community broadcasters through the Broadcasting Funding Scheme, as provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. The purpose of this Scheme, which covers both radio and television, is to encourage the inclusion of additional programming of a particular character in broadcasters programme schedules. The Scheme is open to independent producers and all &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; commercial, community and public service broadcasters. It is funded by way of a payment of 7% of net licence fee receipts, which is paid to the BAI in respect of this Scheme. This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the Broadcasting Act 2009. </p>  <p>  Community Broadcasters also have access to the Community Broadcasting Support Scheme which was recently launched by the BAI. This scheme has a total available fund of &euro;30,000 for 2015 and is open to all fully licensed Community and Community of Interest TV and radio stations throughout the country. This scheme is specifically designed to offer funding support to enable them to further advance from an organisational development perspective, e.g. staff training and capacity development. </p>  <p>  Between 2010 and 2014, the Community radio sector received &euro;3.79 million from the Sound and Vision II scheme to produce 485 various programmes such as documentaries, sports, arts, music and drama. The current scheme, Sound &amp;amp; Vision III, was launched in February 2015 and will see up to &euro;24 million in funding being made available to television and radio programmes through five funding rounds to be rolled out over the next two years.</p></reply>

The Eircode database is derived from this source and the addresses contained in the database are postal addresses used by An Post as opposed to geographical addresses. The postal address is used to ensure the correct routing of mail to individual addresses and for this reason the postal and geographical addresses may differ for some premises, for example in the Tralee/Dingle instance referenced in the Question. The introduction of Eircodes has not changed this. While An Post uses the postal address to effect postal delivery, individuals are entitled to append the Eircode to whatever form of address is normally used.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the provision of Irish language addresses in the Eircode Database is solely derived from the GeoDirectory database. GeoDirectory aims to include the verified official Irish translations of addresses within the database where available, using translations from an Brainse Logainmneacha and Ordnance Survey Ireland. GeoDirectory and An Brainse Logainmneacha are currently exchanging English and Irish postal address data to identify any issues and discrepancies that may exist between the databases. This analysis will facilitate the provision of existing up-to-date official Irish translations for postal addresses in the GeoDirectory database that will be made available in the Eircode Database.</p></reply>

Through this scheme my Department, with the support of the European Union, invested significantly to ensure that infrastructure and services were made available to redress the deficit in basic broadband connectivity which existed at the time in certain designated rural areas. Following a 68 month operational period, the NBS expired in August 2014, in line with EU State Aid guidelines. The NBS, combined with private sector investment in the broadband market over recent years, means that there is now a choice of commercial operators offering basic broadband services, over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout Ireland.</p><p>The details provided in the Question refer to customers previously served by the NBS satellite service, which was utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises. Following the expiry of the NBS, these customers can continue to avail of broadband services on a commercial basis from Digiweb, which had previously provided the NBS satellite service on behalf of &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the NBS service provider. I understand that the tariff offered to former NBS customers is similar to the rates charged by the company to its customers outside of NBS areas and that customers receive increased download and upload speeds as well as a 37% increase in data allowance. </p><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a Government initiative which aims to deliver high speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland.

These rules set out yearly and increasing targets for subtitling, audio description and Irish sign language across a number of television stations.</p><p>The Authority advises that complaints regarding subtitling are directed in the first place to the relevant broadcaster if one is dissatisfied with the manner in which a broadcaster is complying with the Rules.

During the three weeks following the launch, the 2.2 million residential and business address in Ireland received a letter in the post informing them of the new eircode for that address.</p>  <p>  A successful national information campaign was completed over the summer to inform the public about eircodes and promote their usage. </p>  <p>  An integral element of the communications strategy was the Community Outreach Programme for eircodes using networks of community and voluntary organisations, in conjunction with the Wheel and Irish Rural Link. The aim of this programme was to provide information on eircodes and their benefits to people and groups that mainstream communications may not have reached. Over the course of the Community Outreach Programme over 170,000 members of the target group were reached. 5,377 organisations received information about Eircode and 10,620 volunteers recruited to assist. </p>  <p>  During the dissemination phase of eircodes, Am&aacute;rach, an independent body, conducted two parallel surveys, a face-to-face survey of 1,200 households and 200 business premises. The results of the surveys showed that 89% of the public knew the eircode for their address.</p>  <p>  Public Sector bodies, particularly those with large customer facing operations, have started using eircodes in customer engagement and this process will continue over the coming months.</p>  <p>  Since launch the Eircode contractor has been engaging with commercial organisations and, to date, has signed up a total of eighteen Value Added Resellers who provide a broad spectrum of eircode specialist services to businesses including Database cleansing, Address lookup and GeoCoding. In accordance with the contract for the development and maintenance of eircodes, my Department has put in place reporting structures with the contractor which will, inter alia, include information on the commercial use of the Eircode system</p></reply>

Inspections are undertaken on a risk based approach in accordance with international best practice. Where any non-compliance with the terms of the scheme is identified, the results of the inspection are shared with the individual homeowner, and the contractor is obliged to revisit the property and complete remedial works. If the contractor fails to complete the remedial works to the required standard, then they are de-registered from the scheme. Participation in the Better Energy schemes is elective and a contractor may at any point choose not to participate for their own business reasons. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to publish a list of those contractors removed from the registered list.</p></reply>

In pursuit of these objects RT&Eacute; and TG4 are charged, inter-alia, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and &ldquo;have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular the Irish language&rdquo;. RT&Eacute; and TG4 publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Act. The extent to which the commitments entered into by the two public service broadcasters have been met is reviewed annually by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).</p>  <p>  Radio and television services, additional to those provided by the national public service broadcasters are matters for the BAI, which is an independent statutory body. Matters in relation to broadcast content on commercial radio are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and commercial radio operators. In submitting their initial licensing applications to the BAI, such broadcasters put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments, for instance, in regard to the playing of Irish music. If they are successful in their licence applications, these commitments form part of the terms and conditions of the relevant broadcaster's actual licence.</p>  <p>  This policy approach deals with the differing requirements of commercial and public service broadcasting. While I fully support the promotion of Irish music in our broadcasting services, the policy approach taken to this issue must be consistent with EU and Irish regulatory structures. It is also important that it takes account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast, subject, of course, to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations.</p>  <p>  There were a number of meetings held previously in relation to Irish music on the radio which were chaired by the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht and included representatives of the Irish music industry. At my request, officials from my Department have met with officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht in order to see if this process might be reinstated. It is envisaged that any meetings would include officials from my Department and the BAI, as well as relevant industry representatives. At the same time, I understand that the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht have provided funding to the Irish Association of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (IASCA) to introduce a Digital Management Distribution System (DMDS). This system is already used in a number of other countries and will allow for the tracking of Irish music aired on Irish radio stations. It is intended that officials from my Department will make contact with the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht in regard to arranging the proposed meetings once the DMDS system is operational.</p></reply>

IFI continually adapts operational practices to maximise the return on state investment in delivering on these core functions.</p>  <p>  IFI delivers a wide ranging inland national fisheries protection strategy including operation of a fleet of protection vessels around the coast and the deployment of trained, skilled and experienced inland fishery protection and surveillance teams on a 24 hour, 365 day basis throughout the country. Inland patrols and patrols at sea resulted in over 355 nets, measuring over 17,000 metres, being seized in 2014. A range of illegal fishing gear is continually being seized including rods, dinghies and other equipment as well as quantities of fish.</p>  <p>  IFI endeavours to maximise efficiencies through implementation of joint state agency actions and initiatives including patrols with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Irish Air Corps and environmental inspections with a range of State agencies, including the EPA, Irish Water and Local Authorities, with a remit in the protection of the aquatic environment. The implementation of proven traditional work practices and the increasing use of modern technology and innovative specialist vehicle and water based patrols, dog assisted patrolling and improved water quality monitoring equipment have delivered significant efficiencies over the five years since IFI&rsquo;s establishment.</p>  <p>  IFI also seeks, insofar as possible, to address water quality and habitat issues without relying on legal action, as part of its outreach and information activities. However, in circumstances of serious damage to fish life and habitat, IFI will in accordance with its statutory remit use the full range of legal powers available to it including prosecution where considered appropriate. </p>  <p>  It is the policy of IFI to initiate a prosecution where a fish kill occurs and the source of the kill is identified. The Deputy will recall a major fish kill occurred on the River Dodder, Co. Dublin in March 2013 resulting in fish mortalities over a 2 km area. Subsequent IFI investigation determined that some of 3,000 fish had been killed. The investigation led to a conviction and fine in the District Court </p>  <p>  IFI&rsquo;s remit and associated operations are part of the State&rsquo;s important environmental activities; its role is broad and wide ranging. If the Deputy has a particular issue in mind or would like to avail of a more detailed briefing I would be happy to arrange that with IFI.</p></reply>

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended. Licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.</p>  <p>  However, given that mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors. These include topography, the capacity of the network and more generally the level and quality of access customers have to mobile phone antennas. Difficulties for service providers in erecting masts and antennas due to planning issues can also impact negatively on the quality of coverage experienced by consumers.</p>  <p>  Neither I nor my Department has any role or responsibility in the monitoring of coverage or the quality of service being provided by licensed operators. In terms of improving the quality and coverage of mobile services in all areas throughout the country, there are however various initiatives under way. </p>  <p>  The telecommunications sector has invested some &euro;850m in acquiring spectrum under ComReg's 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction. Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide. These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country, although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place. </p>  <p>  As part of the National Broadband Plan, a working group has also been established to address infrastructure issues which were identified by industry as creating barriers to deployment of services generally, which may include mobile services. The group is chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority (NRA) and Local Authorities. The Group is currently consulting with industry on a range of issues relating to the siting of telecommunications infrastructure. My Department will continue to actively engage on this issue with a view to facilitating the removal of barriers and the improvement of mobile services nationwide. </p>  <p>  Local Authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae etc. The Telecommunications and Internet Federation (TIF, which is part of IBEC) has been proactive in seeking to meet with Local Authorities and public representatives to fully discuss the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers experience.</p>  <p>  I would encourage all Local Authorities and public representatives to engage with the TIF on these important issues.</p></reply>

There is free entry into the market and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. As such, I have no function in the setting of petrol, diesel or home heating oil prices. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC, under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) has a role in ensuring that the market is functioning correctly and that consumers are not being disadvantaged. Previous investigations and surveys into oil prices (available at <i></i>) that the CCPC have undertaken indicate that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market. As oil is traded in US dollars the recent weakness of the euro has also impacted on oil prices in the euro area.</p><p>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices (excluding duties and taxes) of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is:</p><p><i>.</i>The latest bulletin from 14 September 2015 shows that petrol prices (including taxes) in Ireland were &euro;1.37 per litre while diesel prices (including taxes) were &euro;1.23 per litre. Heating oil prices (including taxes) in Ireland were &euro;640.49 per 1,000 litres. In September 2014 the comparable prices (including taxes) for Ireland were &euro;1.57 for petrol, &euro;1.48 for diesel and &euro;1,038 per 1,000 litres of home heating oil. This data illustrates that the consumer has seen a reduction in oil prices over the last year.</p></reply>

Where we do not have an EU or bilateral basis for recognition of foreign driving qualifications, people taking up residence in Ireland are by definition treated as learners, and required to undergo the same lessons and tests as other learners.  They are, however, exempt from the normal requirement to spend six months as a learner before taking the test.  </p><p>  In the case of the US, driver licensing operates at State rather than Federal level.  There is therefore a wide variety of licensing systems with widely varying standards, and broad based mutual recognition is not possible.  Under international law, a holder of a licence which is not recognised for exchange may drive in Ireland on their national licence for up to a year, as a visitor. However, if the holder of the licence proposes to become resident in Ireland for a period longer than 12 months then they are required to apply for an Irish licence.  An Irish driving licence may be renewed up to 10 years after it has lapsed without the requirement to undergo a driving test.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement County Councils in their own resources spending this area. While Councils could apply in the past for grant funding for certain road improvement projects, budgetary constraints mean that the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme has been curtailed in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work of the road network.</p>  <p>  The current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and the ability to increase allocations or progress new projects is limited. It is, of course, open to a County Council to fund such projects from its own resources.</p></reply>

Although Northern Ireland operates a system of mandatory registration for B&amp;Bs, research and international benchmarking has established that the registration of B&amp;Bs is not standard practice internationally.  Countries that are recognised for having a quality B&amp;B product, such as England, Scotland, Wales, France and New Zealand, do not require mandatory registration.  For small, seasonal businesses in particular, the potential administrative burden and associated costs of mandatory registration could adversely impact on their viability.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Government's recent Tourism Policy Statement, "People, Place and Policy: Growing Tourism to 2025", it is timely to examine whether the rationale for the statutory regulatory framework still exists.  The current Irish system of registration and classification may be too restrictive in that it may act as a barrier to innovation in the tourism sector.  </p>  <p>  The regulatory framework for any business sector is typically subject to ongoing evaluation, amendment, retrenchment or expansion.  For the tourism industry, what is required is an overall regulatory framework that ensures the safety of visitors and employees, while providing a statutory foundation for private enterprise that is stable and equitable, and encourages the tourism industry to grow and innovate in order to meet the future needs of its customers.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will undertake regular reviews of the regulatory framework for the tourism sector to ensure that it remains fit for purpose.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will support measures across Government that reduce or streamline administrative processes associated with regulatory compliance.</p></reply>

Circular RSD 1/2014 on the Control of Vehicle Speeds in Housing Estates was issued by my Department to local authorities last October. That Circular highlighted existing national guidelines and measures available to local authorities to facilitate traffic calming and it proposed new measures to reduce speed limits in housing estates and residential areas.  In addition, my Department issued new '<i>Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland</i>' to all local authorities earlier this year which also addressed the issue of speed limits on residential roads.</p><p>Among the initiatives covered by these guidelines was an increased emphasis on the use by local authorities of the special speed limit of 30 km/h in housing areas and the associated introduction of new signage in this regard. A sum of &euro;2 million was provided in Budget 2015 in dedicated funding to support the proposed signage programme on public roads throughout the country and further funding will be allocated to local authorities in 2016 to support this programme. </p><p>If further measures are deemed necessary to reduce speeds in local communities, it is a matter for local authorities to assess what actions can best deliver safety improvements in such areas. The new Speed Limit Guidelines give detailed advice in this regard and where regulatory speed limits and signage prove insufficient in securing reduced speeds then such measures may need to be supplemented by engineering measures.</p></reply>

Based on research on the demographic segments of our overseas markets with a higher likelihood to select Ireland as a destination, the tourism agencies are developing and promoting tourism propositions of scale capable of achieving international cut-through and securing consumer attention, namely the experience brands of the Wild Atlantic Way, Dublin Plus, Ireland's Ancient East.  In regard to the South West region, Kerry features prominently in the Wild Atlantic Way and Cork is strongly represented in both the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  </p>  <p>  I have referred the Deputy's question to the tourism agencies for further detail on the development and marketing of the region as part of these experience brands.  Please contact my private office if you do not hear from them within ten working days.</p></reply>

Following EU Commission approval of the Programme on 3 August, the four regional airports have been provided with the criteria necessary (and as set out in the programme) for submitting applications to my Department for Exchequer supports, including a five-year business plan, an economic evaluation of the airport's contribution to the region and other financial information.  Detailed consideration within the Department is a prerequisite to the formal granting of approval to each airport for funding supports over the life of the Programme.  My Department has just received an application from IWAK which is being evaluated.  We are awaiting applications from the other three airports.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the above State aid supports, my Department will also provide, in accordance with the 2014 EU Guidelines on state aid to airports and airlines, financial supports to the four airports in respect of those airport activities that normally fall under the responsibility of the State in the exercise of its official powers as a public authority, such as air traffic control, customs, firefighting, passenger and baggage screening etc.  These activities are not of an economic nature, fall within the remit of Public Policy Remit and in general do not come within the scope of EU rules on state aid.  The actual level of Public Policy Remit funding supports to be made available to in 2015 is in the process of being determined by my officials in consultation with the four regional airports.</p></reply>

In 2015, local authorities may use up to 15% of their Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes is set at 20%. </p>  <p>  A further &euro;24 million (Stimulus) under Restoration Improvement was allocated to local authorities in July 2015 and local authorities were permitted to use up to 20% of this additional allocation for CIS and up to 10% for the Local Improvements Scheme if they wish to do so.</p></reply>

Consent under the National Monuments Acts was given to the Council by my Department in 2010 for urgent stabilisation works as a precursor to a more substantial conservation programme.  I understand that a conservation plan was subsequently commissioned by the Council in 2011 which outlined the range and criticality of the interventions considered necessary at that stage.</p><p>Funding is provided by my Department through a number of schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  This funding is either directly administered or delivered through local authorities and certain agencies.  On 9 February last, I announced an allocation of &euro;624,000 for the Structures at Risk Fund 2015,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This Fund, which is being administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures, which might otherwise be lost.  The Fund, which is now closed, was open to two applications per local authority, of which only one application may be in respect of a publicly-owned building.  It is primarily a matter for the local authority to nominate its two applications.  Since 2011, in excess of 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.  The operation of a similar scheme in the future would be contingent on dedicated funding being made available to my Department.</p><p>The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 is focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2015 the Council administered a community based heritage grants scheme with funding of &euro;547,000 available for projects that contribute to particular heritage themes.

The aim of the network is to assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats.  It is comprised of special areas of conservation designated by Member States under the Habitats Directive and also incorporates special protection areas under the 1979 Birds Directive.  The criteria for selecting sites eligible for identification as sites of community importance and designated as special areas of conservation are set out in Annex III of the Habitats Directive.</p><p>The Habitats Directive has been fully transposed into Irish law by means of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, as amended, and by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, as amended.</p><p>A natural heritage area is considered important for the habitats present or for the species of plants and animals it holds whose habitat needs protection.  Natural Heritage Areas are designated under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and are legally protected from negative impacts from the date they are formally proposed for designation through a requirement to obtain Ministerial consent before certain potentially damaging activities are undertaken. </p><p>Persons, whose interests are affected by a proposed designation and wish to object, must lodge an objection within three months of the advertisement of a proposal to designate a site.  All objections must be made in writing and be accompanied by a good quality map with the boundary of the area relating to the objection clearly outlined.  Adjustments to boundaries are made only on scientific grounds. </p><p>Further information in relation to the site designation process is available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at www.npws.ie.</p><p>There are currently 155 natural heritage areas.  75 raised bogs, which are located mainly in the midlands, have been given legal protection as natural heritage areas, covering some 23,000 hectares.  A further 73 blanket bogs, covering 37,000 hectares, mostly in western areas, are also designated as natural heritage areas.  In addition 7 natural heritage areas, identified as of particular importance to birds, have also been designated.</p><p>While some natural heritage areas exist entirely or partly within candidate special areas of conservation or special protection areas, pursuant to the EU Nature Directives, my Department estimates that some 45,873 hectares of land is solely designated within natural heritage areas.</p><p>In addition, there are 630 proposed natural heritage areas.  While a review of these sites is foreseen, this will not take place in the immediate future, having regard to the available resources.</p><p>In January 2014, the <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network </i>was<i></i>published and concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  This entails the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain raised bog natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.  46 raised bog natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 sites) are scheduled for de-designation.  To compensate for the loss of habitat within these sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can continue, 25 undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, will be designated as natural heritage areas.  Compensation will be made available to affected turf cutters.</p><p>The area of land in County Leitrim, referred to by the Deputy, was initially proposed for designation in January 2004 for the protection of upland blanket bog and has been formally designated as a natural heritage area by Statutory Instrument since 2005 (S.I. 473/2005).</p></reply>

However, there is a facility under the legislation for a person to obtain a permit, under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts, to take certain actions, including the scaring, capturing or killing of birds, where they are causing serious damage to buildings and other structures, food (including human food products), agricultural crops, forestry plantations, other fauna, etc.  Applications for such permits are considered on a case by case basis by my Department.  The criteria for licensing do not include noise, however.</p>  <p>  The population of herring gulls has greatly declined in Ireland (by about 90%) over the past 40 years, probably due to improvements in managing landfill sites, as well as other factors.  Nonetheless, there are substantial numbers in some coastal towns and cities, including north Dublin city and county.  Herring gulls can be a nuisance because of noise, mainly in July and early August, and may steal food from people eating outdoors.  In the latter case, the easy availability of food sources from litter or feeding by people may be contributing factors to the bird behaviour of concern.</p>  <p>  Householders can take steps, outside the breeding season, to make roofs unsuitable for nesting and thereby reduce the presence of gulls.</p></reply>

My Department is not involved currently in any eradication or control measures in respect of Japanese knotweed and consequently will incur no expenditure this year in that regard.

This review should act as an important tool for the Arts Council to improve its hugely beneficial work in funding arts organisations across the State.  The review commends the Council for its response to the economic crisis by significantly reducing administration costs; overhauling its organisational structures; and developing on its RAISE initiative, which helps arts organisations to diversify funding streams.</p><p>The review also highlights the need for the Council to expand its efforts to improve transparency around its decision making; give greater consideration to addressing the issue of regional balance in accessing the arts; to engage more with stakeholders and establish the evidence-base for the societal benefits of its work.</p><p>This review is available to download on my Department's website.</p></reply>

I should point out that I also decided to sanction two of the coursing clubs, which are the subject of two of Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Questions, due to infringements of the conditions of the licences at coursing meetings held during the 2014/15 season.  These sanctions, which were imposed on foot of reports from regional staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, entail a reduction in the number of courses run by both clubs at their next meetings compared to the number of courses run at last year&rsquo;s meetings.     </p>  <p>  Regional staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department will continue to attend coursing meetings during the 2015/16 season, as resources allow, to monitor compliance with the conditions of the licences.</p></reply>

As a result, a review of the current legislation was initiated to ensure that it remains both effective and balanced.  Stakeholders had been seeking an opportunity to input their views on the operation of section 40 of the Acts and I announced, last year, a consultation process which provided that opportunity.

Regulation 25 does not relate to a situation where the owner is seeking a mortgage.  At the time of the original notification of the intention to designate protected nature conservation sites, landowners/users were supplied with a map of the proposed area, information on the site outlining the habitats and species being protected and a list of activities that would require consent before being undertaken.
