Since 2009, the scheme has supported the renovation of almost 97,000 homes in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, energy efficiency upgrades are provided free of charge to those households who meet the application criteria.  Measures are provided under the scheme on an "as needed" basis and include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation. </p>  <p>  Window and door insulation are not currently supported under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme due to the need to balance the limited resources available with the demands for this scheme.  Therefore, the measures currently supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost. While both window and door insulation do improve the energy efficiency of a home, the cost of such measures is high in relation to the energy efficiency gains made.</p></reply>

The Eircode Finder, is an eircode look up application that helps citizens and business to fully utilise the new postcode system.  There was significant interest in the &lsquo;Eircode finder tool&rsquo; on launch day with over 800,000 look ups when it went live. During the three weeks following the launch, the 2.2 million residential and business address in Ireland received a letter in the post informing them of the new eircode for that address.</p><p>A successful national information campaign was completed over the summer to inform the public about eircodes and promote their usage.  The campaign included advertisements in the national media, including TV, radio and newspapers. The media campaign ran until 30 August 2015. </p><p>An integral element of the communications strategy was the Community Outreach Programme for eircodes using networks of community and voluntary organisations, in conjunction with the Wheel and Irish Rural Link.  The aim of this programme was to provide information on eircodes and their benefits to people and groups that mainstream communications may not have reached.  This approach allowed any concerns to be addressed locally in a timely manner.  Over the course of the Community Outreach Programme 15,377 organisations received information about Eircode with 10,620 volunteers recruited to assist. During this phase 4,722 local organisations were mobilised and 1,235 events were held involving the target group.</p><p>During the dissemination phase of eircodes, Am&aacute;rach, an independent body, conducted two parallel surveys, a face-to-face survey of 1,200 households and 200 business premises.  The results of the surveys showed that 89% of the public knew the eircode for their address.</p><p>Public Sector bodies, particularly those with large customer facing operations, have started using eircodes in customer engagement and this process will continue over the coming months.</p><p>Since launch the Eircode contractor has been engaging with commercial organisations and, to date, has signed up a total of eighteen Value Added Resellers who provide a broad spectrum of eircode specialist services to businesses including Database cleansing, Address lookup and GeoCoding.  In accordance with the contract for the development and maintenance of eircodes, my Department has put in place reporting structures with the contractor which will, inter alia, include information on the commercial use of the Eircode system.</p></reply>

It sets out the key elements of the intervention - what services are proposed and how they will be delivered. It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned.  The draft Intervention Strategy has been developed following intensive engagement with industry and wider stakeholders. </p>  <p>  In addition, the European Commission has set out detailed guidelines on what is required to obtain State Aid approval for Government interventions in the broadband sector. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has followed these guidelines when formulating the proposed intervention strategy. Key among those guidelines is the requirement to observe a strict policy of technology neutrality in designing an intervention programme and in running a procurement process.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department cannot and will not specify any particular technology platform when going to the market to secure a potential bidder or bidders for the NBP contract. It will be up to bidders to set out clearly in their bid how they propose to meet the standard of services being sought by the Government. However, it is anticipated that any proposals from bidders will have fibre technology as a key element within their solution. It is recognised within industry that fibre is the technology of choice for at least the backhaul part of the network. </p>  <p>  The Strategy demonstrates clearly the Government&rsquo;s commitment to honouring its pledge to deal definitively with the challenge of providing resilient and high-quality broadband connectivity to every premises in the country, irrespective of location.</p></reply>

This public consultation closes on the 25<sup>th</sup>of this month. Following the consultation process, the Minister plans to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.The physical build of the network is expected to begin in late 2016, and it will take 3-5 years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected. </p><p>This complex national infrastructure project will definitively address the long-standing challenge of deploying a resilient and high-quality broadband network, particularly in rural parts of Ireland.</p><p>An intrinsic part of the Department's approach to planning and developing the NBP strategy has been to engage with all stakeholders and, in particular, with industry. This engagement has enabled the production of the national high speed broadband coverage map in November last which is currently being updated, again in close collaboration with industry.</p><p>Details of meetings with industry and of site visits to particular trials or projects being run by individual operators are provided in the Department's monthly NBP update which is available on the Department's website and which is emailed to all Oireachtas members. </p><p>Departmental officials will continue to liaise closely with the commercial operators until such time as the project moves to formal procurement phase.</p></reply>

The purpose of the trade negotiations is to reduce barriers to trade and investment in order to generate jobs and growth. Ireland stands to gain significantly from this because of the existing significant flows of trade and investment between Ireland and the US and briefing and update material on these negotiations can be found on the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i>I can assure the Deputy that conclusion of an agreement will have no impact on the public policy approach adopted by Ireland in the area of exploration for hydrocarbon resources. </p><p>The scope of the EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the United States includes investment protection and investor state dispute settlement. Countries sign such agreements in order to set out certain ground rules when foreign companies invest on their territory. The EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate clearly provides that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of the EU and Member States to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety, in a non-discriminatory manner.</p></reply>

Since its publication the Department undertook a public consultation process which included analysis of over 1200 written submissions and thirteen stakeholder seminars, held in Dublin, Westmeath, Sligo, Cork and Wexford, on the various priority areas highlighted in the Green Paper.  A recurring message coming from both the written submissions and the seminars was the role that community energy could play in our future energy systems. The views submitted are being considered in the formation of the Energy White Paper, which will be published before the end of the year, and which will, <i>inter alia,</i>address community energy projects and how best to facilitate communities in playing their part.</p><p>I should also highlight the various community level initiatives administered on behalf of the Department by the SEAI. These include the development of community energy projects through the Better Energy Areas and Communities Programme which allows community and locally based organisations to apply for funding on a competitive basis to support sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings and facilities. It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can engage and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost local employment.</p></reply>

The rates of tariff for AD technologies available under the scheme were calculated following analysis by the Department along with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, and Teagasc. Since the introduction of the scheme in 2012, the Department has received a number of applications from AD plants for support.</p>  <p>  The cost effectiveness of support for renewables is a key consideration in the work now underway in the Department to consider the appropriateness and design of new support schemes for renewable electricity and renewable heat. The initial public consultations on the two proposed new schemes for heat and electricity respectively closed on Friday, 18 September 2015. There will be a further two opportunities for the public to contribute to the development of the schemes. A key consideration in the design of the schemes will be the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of any support required. Both schemes are expected to be available in 2016 subject to EU state aid clearance and Government approval.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that academic and industry research suggests that there is the potential for a significant role in the heat and transport sectors for biogas, which is produced by anaerobic digestion. The draft Bioenergy Plan, published by the Minister last year, recommended that a detailed economic assessment of the costs and benefits of biogas would be conducted. </p>  <p>  The Bioenergy Steering Group, which has been established to coordinate the implementation of the draft Plan, is currently finalising the request for tender document and the Department expects to be inviting tenders for this work shortly.</p></reply>

Offshore renewable energy has the potential to: generate carbon free renewable electricity; reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels; enhance our security of energy supply; and deliver green growth and jobs to the economy.</p>  <p>  Policy action across a range of areas is required to support developers in bringing ocean energy devices, including wave and tidal, from prototype to full scale commerciality. Such action is being taken in the context of the implementation of the 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which sets out Government policy in relation to the sustainable development of Ireland's abundant offshore renewable energy resources. A Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR), has been established which includes representatives from other relevant government departments and agencies. The Steering Group is overseeing the implementation of the Plan. </p>  <p>  Exchequer support for ocean research, development and demonstration has been provided to the sector in recent years and is being increased under the OREDP. In total, my Department has allocated &euro;26.3 million for ocean energy for the period 2013 to 2016. This supports the development of the test sites in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, the Integrated Maritime Energy Resource Cluster (IMERC) at Ringaskiddy, and the Prototype Development Fund operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which provides grant aid for the development of prototype ocean energy devices. </p>  <p>  Further funding options are being discussed cross-departmentally and the OREDP also proposes, subject to further Government approval, an initial market support scheme for wave and tidal energy from 2016 onwards.</p></reply>

As part of this work, officials are participating in the European Commission's Vulnerable Consumers Working Group having participated in the Energy Citizens Forum held in London in March of this year. I welcome this European Commission initiative along with the publication by the Commission in July of this year of their Communication &quot;Delivering a New Deal for Energy Consumers&quot;.</p><p>That Commission Communication is a supporting policy document to the Energy Union Framework Strategy which sets out the vision of an Energy Union &quot;<i>with citizens at its core, where citizens take ownership of the energy transition, benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills, participate actively in the market, and where vulnerable consumers are protected</i>&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Delivering a New Deal for Energy Consumers&quot; identified energy poverty as an important issue requiring Member State action. The Communication also identified energy efficiency as the best way to address energy poverty in the long term, while recognising that this must take place in the wider context of action on poverty. It is the stated position of the Commission that the citizen must be at the heart of the new Energy Union. This means that both the EU, and Member States, must find more effective ways to address energy poverty as part of the action also needed to support and empower energy consumers. The Minister will continue to push for energy poverty to be kept high on the EU energy agenda, and ensure that improving the energy efficiency of homes of those vulnerable to energy poverty remains central to Ireland&rsquo;s Better Energy Programme.</p><p>The Minister expects to publish the new Affordable Energy Strategy around the end of this year.</p></reply>

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended. Licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.</p><p>However, given that mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors. These include topography, the capacity of the network and more generally the level and quality of access customers have to mobile phone antennas. Difficulties for service providers in erecting masts and antennas due to planning issues can also impact negatively on the quality of coverage experienced by consumers.</p><p>In terms of improving the quality and coverage of mobile services in all areas throughout the country, there are various initiatives underway to achieve this aim. </p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising both fixed and mobile networks. This includes some &euro;850m invested in acquiring spectrum under the 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction run by ComReg. Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide. These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country, although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place.</p><p>While investment in communications infrastructure and services is primarily a matter for the private sector, the National Broadband Plan (NBP) commits to a range of actions that will facilitate the more efficient<font color="#1F497D"> </font>commercial<font color="#1F497D"> </font>investment in the rollout of communications infrastru<font color="#1F497D">c</font>ture.</p><p>The NBP is a Government policy initiative which aims to deliver high speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland. This is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a proposed State intervention to provide high speed broadband to those parts of the country where the commercial sector will not invest. </p><p>The NBP proposed Intervention Strategy document, which was published on 15 July last, sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention. It sets out the key elements of the intervention - what services are proposed and how they will be delivered. It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan in 2012, a working group has been established to address infrastructure issues which were identified by industry as creating barriers to deployment of services. The group is chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority (NRA) and Local Authorities. The Group is currently consulting with industry on a range of issues relating to the siting of telecommunications infrastructure. My Department will continue to actively engage on this issue with a view to facilitating the removal of barriers and the improvement of mobile service nationwide. </p><p>Local Authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae etc. The Telecommunications and Internet Federation (TIF, which is part of IBEC) has been proactive in seeking to meet with Local Authorities and public representatives to fully discuss the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers experience.</p><p>I would encourage all Local Authorities and public representatives to engage with the TIF on these important issues.</p></reply>

It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can engage and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost local employment.</p>  <p>  One of the central themes in the Green Paper on Energy Policy, published in May 2014, is citizen empowerment. Since its publication the Department undertook a public consultation process which included analysis of over 1200 written submissions and thirteen stakeholder seminars, held in Dublin, Westmeath, Sligo, Cork and Wexford, on the various priority areas highlighted in the Green Paper. A recurring message coming from both the written submissions and the seminars was the role that community energy could play in our future energy systems.

The classification for unemployed persons includes those persons aged 15-74 years who, in the week before the survey, were without work and available for work within the next two weeks, and had taken specific steps, in the preceding four weeks, to find work.  The QNHS does not capture a respondent's status as measured by the Live Register.</p>  <p>  The Live Register is compiled from returns made for each local office to the Central Statistics Office by the Department of Social Protection.  It comprises persons under 65 years of age in the following classes:</p>  <p>  All Claimants for Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) excluding systematic short-time workers.</p>  <p>  Applicants for Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) excluding smallholders/farm assists and other self-employed persons.</p>  <p>  Other registrants including applicants for credited Social Welfare contributions but excluding those directly involved in an industrial dispute.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment as per the ILO unemployment classification used by the QNHS.  It includes part-time workers (those who work up to three days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance.</p></reply>

After lengthy and difficult discussions, the Euro Summit reached agreement on a series of measures that enabled negotiations on a third programme of assistance to begin between Greece and the Institutions.  Satisfactory progress in these negotiations, supported by the urgent implementation by Greece of a number of demanding conditions, allowed for a political agreement to be reached at Eurogroup level on 14 August and for a first disbursement of additional support on 20 August.</p>  <p>  At the European Council meeting of 25-26 June, Heads of State and Government urged Prime Minister Tsipras to make every effort to conclude an agreement and put an end to the instability which was having such a detrimental effect on the Greek economy and people.  At that time, negotiations were being taken forward with the Institutions and by Finance Ministers through the Eurogroup.  However, following the breaking off of negotiations by the Greek government, the holding of a referendum on 5 July, and the radical deterioration of Greece&rsquo;s financial situation, the situation in Greece was felt to require a special Euro Summit meeting on 7 July.  It was agreed that the Greek government would, on Thursday 9 July at the latest, present proposals for a comprehensive and specific reform agenda for assessment by the three institutions and presentation to the Eurogroup.  The Eurogroup considered these proposals at meetings on 11 and 12 July, prior to the meeting of the Euro Summit.</p>  <p>  Throughout all of the European Council and Euro Summit negotiations, I expressed Ireland's understanding and empathy with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  I highlighted our willingness to negotiate a way forward and achieve a sustainable solution that took account of the realities of the situation in Greece, while also respecting existing commitments.  I stressed our determination to ensure that Greece can continue as a member of the euro area.  At both of the Euro Summits in July, I intervened along these lines, and participated in the Summit&rsquo;s negotiations on the texts of the Conclusions. </p>  <p>  The negotiations were undoubtedly difficult and Greece remains in a very challenging situation.  However, if the agreed measures continue to be taken forward swiftly in accordance with the commitments made, as they have been to date, I believe that there is a real basis for Greece, with the support of partners, to return to stability and growth within the euro area.  That is the objective towards which we have all worked and will continue to work. </p></reply>

Internal Audit Charter



1.0Introduction

1.1This Charter sets out the purpose, authority and responsibilities of the Internal Audit function in the Department of the Taoiseach.



2.0Internal Audit Unit

2.1The Internal Audit Unit&rsquo;s function is to provide assurance to the Accounting Officer on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s system of internal controls.

2.2The Unit operates as a resource for Departmental and Divisional managers through its analysis and appraisal of Departmental control systems.  In its reports the Unit makes recommendations to management based on &lsquo;Best Practice&rsquo;.

2.3The Unit will also act in an advisory capacity to projects under development to ensure the adequacy of control measures.



3.0Internal Audit Committee

3.1The Accounting Officer is the person responsible for appointing the membership of the Internal Audit Committee.  The Committee comprises 2 Department officials and 2 external representatives from another Government Department.  The Accounting Officer may change the membership of the Committee as and when required.

The current membership of the Audit Committee is as follows: -</p><p>3.2Although not members of the Committee, the Heads of the Finance Unit and Internal Audit Unit may attend Committee meetings.  The managers of any Divisions or Offices may attend Committee meetings discussing internal audit reports on their particular sections.  The Committee mayoccasionally decide to hold meetings without these managers (including the Head of the Finance Unit) being present.

3.3.The Internal Audit Committee will consider the work of the Internal Audit Unit comprising audit reports that have been submitted, the schedule of work (Work Programmes) and other matters as appropriate.

3.4The operation of the Internal Audit Committee will be reviewed by the Accounting Officer, the Chairperson of the Committee and the Head of the Internal Audit Unit after a three-year period. 

3.5The Internal Audit Committee should ensure &lsquo;Quality Assurance Reviews&rsquo; of the Internal Audit Unit on a regular basis, i.e. at least once every five years.



4.0Responsibilities

4.1The Internal Audit Unit operates as an independent advisory service and outside of this has no operational role.  Responsibility for internal control rests with managers who, without regard to audit activity, ensure that appropriate and adequate control arrangements exist in their areas of responsibility.  The role of internal audit is to appraise the adequacy and effectiveness of those arrangements and to make recommendations for improvements as appropriate.

4.2It is for managers and Departmental management to decide upon the appropriate response to reports and recommendations of internal audit.

4.3The Internal Audit Unit will liaise, as necessary and appropriate, with external auditors, including the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

4.4The Internal Audit Unit is authorised to have full access to Departmental records (manual and electronic), physical properties and personnel relevant to the carrying out of a review.  It will be responsible for affording to records and other materials entrusted to its care, the same protections afforded by staff in whose care they normally are retained.</p><p>5.0Scope

5.1The Internal Audit Unit will, in general, adopt a systems-based approach to its audits supplemented, where appropriate, by the use of traditional transaction-testing, vouching and verification methods .

5.2The Internal Audit Unit will be responsible for reviewing and appraising the following: -

5.2.1the design and operation of all systems and procedures (financial, managerial etc.) which are intended to control the Department's operations, including those used by management to measure the effectiveness of programmes and other activities of the Department;

5.2.2the adequacy, reliability and integrity of the information systems used to monitor the Department&rsquo;s activities and to ensure accountability;

5.2.3the degree of compliance with (a) legislation (domestic and international) and other requirements laid down centrally (e.g. by the Department of Finance) and (b) management plans, procedures and policies;

5.2.4the acquisition and disposal of assets and the safeguarding of assets and interests from losses, including those arising from fraud, malpractice and irregularity;</p><p>6.0Reporting Accountabilities

6.1The Head of the Internal Audit Unit will report to the Internal Audit Committee on a regular basis, as agreed in the context of the Annual Work programme, and in particular circumstances, as requested by the Accounting Officer/Internal Audit Committee.

6.2.Audit reports prepared by the Internal Auditor will be submitted to the Accounting Officer by the Head of Internal Audit.  A copy of the reports will also be circulated to the Internal Audit Committee which in turn will submit its observations on reports to the Accounting Officer.

6.3The Internal Audit Committee will submit an annual report to the Accounting Officer.  A copy will be provided, for information, to the Taoiseach.



7.0Resourcing

7.1The Expenses of the Internal Audit function shall be met from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.



8.0Conflict of Interest

8.1.In view of the relatively small size of the Department and the need to make the most efficient use of resources the Head of the Internal Audit Unit will be assigned on a part-time basis.  However, to ensure an appropriate level of access within the Department and that particular concerns and recommendations are acted upon,  he/she shall be at Principal Officer level and will perform the audit role in addition to his/her Divisional duties within the Department.  

8.2.Should for any reason a matter arise relating to the Principal Officer&rsquo;s dual roles where a potential conflict of interest might arise then he/she should advise the Chairman of the Audit Committee accordingly who will ensure that appropriate steps are taken.

This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. </p><p>Youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 22.4% in Q2 2015, as compared to 26.9% in Q2 2014).  These figures are not adjusted for seasonality; the seasonally-adjusted rate published by the Central Statistics Office as of August 2015 was 20.7%.</p><p>The number of young people who are long-term unemployed has fallen from 35,000 in mid-2012 (46% of all the young unemployed at that time) to 13,000 (31% of all the young unemployed) in mid-2015.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy and the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.</p></reply>

This income has been for many years treated in the same manner as earnings from employment for PRSI purposes and accordingly is subject to Class A PRSI.  Therefore participants on CE schemes, similar to other private sector employees who pay Class A, can establish entitlement to the full range of short term benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit, and maternity benefit and to long term benefits including State pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  As of 31 August 2015, there were 1,957 CE participants in receipt of payments in excess of &euro;352 per week and who would therefore be liable to make an employee PRSI contribution.  For over 98% of these CE participants there is a financial incentive to participate in the scheme as the net amount of their CE payment exceeds their underlying social welfare entitlement.</p>  <p>  Any proposed PRSI exemption for CE participants paying PRSI would have to apply to all workers similarly paying PRSI and with access to the same level of social insurance benefits.  This would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

On that date, approximately 25,500 affected customers were supported by the Department to transition to a range of alternative income support payments.</p>  <p>  In the months in advance of the implementation of the final phase of reforms to the one-parent family payment scheme, the Department contacted all affected lone parents and invited them to attend information seminars.  At these seminars lone parents were advised of the best possible options available to them depending on their circumstances.</p>  <p>  Of the affected 25,500 customers, approximately 96% transitioned to another social welfare payment, of which 13,500 transitioned to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST), 2,500 transitioned to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment (JA), and 8,100 transitioned to the family income supplement (FIS).  The 8,100 customers who transitioned to the family income supplement are also eligible for the back to work family dividend (BTWFD) and a large proportion of these customers have already availed of the dividend.</p>  <p>  Since the changes came into effect the Department has written to affected lone parents and invited them to participate in a meeting with a case officer with a view to improving their employment prospects.</p></reply>

It is paid to around 616,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014.  Child Benefit continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability.  I am conscious that Child Benefit is an important source of income for all families and in Budget 2015 the Government increased child benefit by &euro;5 per month, at a cost of &euro;72 million. </p>  <p>  Budget 2009 provided for the reduction of the age for which Child Benefit is paid from under 19 years to under 18 years.  This measure was implemented in full in 2011 and has resulted in savings of &euro;79 million on an annual basis.  A value for money review of child income supports undertaken by the Department of Social Protection in 2010 found that participation patterns in education support the 18 year age limit for Child Benefit. </p>  <p>  The estimated cost of reversing the budgetary decision made in 2010 to terminate Child Benefit payments at 18 years of age and to extend the upper age limit for those in education to 19 years would be in the region of &euro;58 million in a full year.  Any changes to the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit could only be decided in a budgetary context. </p></reply>

While the Department&rsquo;s response times for carers benefit has increased slightly from 6.2 weeks in 2011 to 8.4 weeks at end of August 2015, the response time to requests for submissions to the Department for appeals of carers allowance has reduced from an average of 17.9 weeks in 2011 to 12.9 weeks at end August 2015.</p>  <p>  Processing times are calculated from the registration date to the date of finalisation and include time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant and time in the Department for review and preparation of its appeal submission, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that an individual can maximise their entitlement to an SPC, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Under this system, the rate of the SPC is related to the average contributions paid (or credited) over their working life.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 52 contributions (i.e. 100%) would generally receive a full rate pension (personal rate &euro;230.30), whereas someone with a yearly average of only 30 contributions paid or credited would have an entitlement, under the SPC, to a weekly personal rate of &euro;207, which is 90% of the maximum rate.  If such a pensioner was paid the same rate of contributory pension as someone who had paid into the social insurance system all their working life, it would mean there was no benefit derived from the much greater contribution made by that person.  As it is, the benefit derived from paying PRSI is greater, in relative terms, for those with limited contribution records and who receive lower rate pensions, than it is for full-rate pensioners.</p>  <p>  Where an older person qualifies for the reduced rate SPC of &euro;207, but they do not have other income (such as a private pension), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  In such cases they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the SPC.  </p>  <p>  If a person does not believe that my Department has calculated their pension entitlements correctly, they may request that the decision be reviewed in the first instance, or they may appeal it to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p></reply>

These supports play an important role in facilitating increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the EmployAbility (supported employment) service, the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities and the disability awareness training scheme.  For those who are in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit (for at least six months) and who feel they now have some capacity for work, the partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme allows them to work and retain a portion of their social welfare payment. People on disability-related payments also have access to activation programmes such as Community employment and Jobbridge administered by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Unlike job-seekers where participation in activation measures through the Intreo service is mandatory, in the case of persons in receipt of disability/illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis and at all times they are free to contact the Intreo service.  The Department has trialled in ten locations provision of full activation supports to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the Intreo service and will consider expansion to other locations on the basis of operational experience. </p>  <p>  The Momentum programme is funded by the  Department of Education and Skills through Solas and is designed on a payments by results basis specifically for long-term unemployed jobseekers. The Department of social Protection, through Intreo, identifies and refers eligible and suitable clients to the Momentum programme. The current phase of Momentum is coming to a conclusion and a decision has yet to be taken on whether or not it will operate again next year. Should it be decided to repeat the programme, the Department will together with the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS consider if, and if so how, eligibility be extended to people with disabilities.</p></reply>

This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. </p><p>Youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 22.4% in Q2 2015, as compared to 26.9% in Q2 2014). These figures are not adjusted for seasonality; the seasonally-adjusted rate as of August 2015 was 20.7%.</p><p>The number of young people who are long-term unemployed has fallen from 35,000 in mid-2012 (46% of all the young unemployed at that time) to 13,000 (31% of all the young unemployed) in mid-2015.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work</i>strategy and the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.</p></reply>

WALK Peer supported a total of 119 participants during the lifetime of the project, with 12 participants remaining in education or some form of employment after 12 months.</p><p>The objective of the DACT project was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.  A key criterion applied when selecting projects was that any learning from the projects should be capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the future.</p><p>The Department commissioned Indecon International Economic Consultants to undertake an independent evaluation of the DACT project as a whole.

Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts, or where there has been a change of circumstances which has come to notice since the date of the Appeals Officer's original decision.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the person concerned has submitted additional evidence and that the file has been recalled from the Invalidity Pension section. The file will be submitted to the Appeals Officer for further consideration.
