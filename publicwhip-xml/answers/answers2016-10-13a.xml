On 19 July, under S.I. No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act as necessary to get the new Regulatory Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year nominations for membership of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority were duly obtained from the ten prescribed nominating bodies set out for that purpose in the 2015 Act.  Following the relevant procedures, resolutions approving their appointment as members were passed by the Seanad on 19 July 2016 and by the D&aacute;il on 21 July 2016, such resolutions being required under section 9 (2)(a) of the Act.  Following this, the Government, at its meeting of 27 September 2016, duly appointed ten members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  These were: Don Thornhill; Angela Black; Deirdre McHugh; Gerry Whyte; Stephen Fitzpatrick; Dermott Jewell; David Barniville; Joan Crawford; Geraldine Clarke; and James MacGuill.  At the same time, as provided under the 2015 Act, the Government agreed the appointment of Dr. Don Thornhill, being an approved lay member, as Chairperson of the new Regulatory Authority.  Under the 2015 Act, the Authority has a total of eleven members including a lay majority and lay Chair.</p>  <p>  It was also agreed at that time, following the relevant procedures of the 2015 Act, that Eileen Barrington SC be put forward as an alternative nominee of the King&rsquo;s Inns for membership of the new Authority.  This arose from the fact that their initial nominee, who had also been approved in July, was no longer available.  The relevant resolutions of both Houses approving the appointment of Eileen Barrington SC were passed on 6 October 2016.  Her appointment will, therefore, complete the eleven-person membership of the new Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  Initial briefings and secretarial support are being provided at official level for Dr. Don Thornhill as Chairperson of the new Authority and he is engaged in ongoing consultations with his incoming colleagues on the Authority.  Initial office accommodation for the Authority has been identified that will accommodate a small start-up team of three or four staff.  This is intended to provide a bridge-head from which a permanent premises and additional working capacity can be secured.  The first formal meeting of the Authority will take place on 26 October.</p>  <p>  On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  Following on from the setting of establishment day, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year - with some carry-over anticipated into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function.  The current phase will, therefore, include the phased commencement of Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.</p>  <p>  Following this, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The managed commencement of these functions is considered essential in order to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 31 August 2016, there were 24 Reserves assigned to the Sligo/Leitrim Division and 36 assigned to the Galway Division. </p>  <p>  I announced earlier this week the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has been provided for the recruitment in 2017 of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300 in 2017.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of the commitment to double the Reserve to 2,000 and what steps might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office.  I understand that that Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 789 members to 2,000.  As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered. </p></reply>

The 2016 recruitment campaign for trainee Garda&iacute; included for the first time a special stream for eligible reserve members as a means of giving due recognition to satisfactory service by such members.  This has worked well and so far 39 members of the Reserve have entered the Garda College via that special stream and more will enter over the remainder of this year and into next year.  The concept of a special Reserve stream has been continued in the new recruitment campaign which I announced on 8 September for which the closing date for applications was 29 September. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is the Public Appointments Service (PAS) which conducts the recruitment process for trainee Garda&iacute; on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that provisional figures indicate that there are 5,110 applicants for the general stream of whom 129 are also applicants for the special Reserve stream.</p></reply>

Both the Irish and British Governments have made it clear that it is their wish to maintain the CTA arrangements after the UK leaves the European Union.  Both Governments have also expressed their commitment to ensuring there is no return to a so-called 'hard border' between both parts of the Island. </p>  <p>  There have been a number of misleading media reports on these matters in recent days.  It has always been the case that Ireland and the United Kingdom cooperate closely on jointly securing the external border of the CTA and we will continue to cooperate, and to strengthen that cooperation, in the future.  In that regard a central feature of the operation of the CTA has been that each State enforces the other's conditions of landing for non-EEA nationals, thus protecting each other's borders.  In addition, cooperation extends across a number of other areas including the sharing of information and at an operational level on enforcement.  For example, on the information  front, earlier this year new arrangements to allow for the sharing of Advanced Passenger Information between Ireland and the UK in order to further enhance the integrity of the Common Travel Area were introduced.  The development of the British-Irish Visa System was facilitated by this arrangement and indeed could not have happened without the electronic sharing of information such as biometrics.  </p>  <p>  The impact of 'Brexit' on the right to free movement of EEA citizens will ultimately be a matter that will feature within the negotiation process that will take place following the UK's formal notification to the European Council that it intends to leave, and it is therefore not possible at this juncture to say what arrangements will apply between the UK and EU in the future in respect of such persons.  What I can make clear is that, while we will continue to maintain and enhance cooperation with the UK in relation to general immigration and border enforcement, Ireland of course remains a committed member of the European Union and will continue to uphold the right of free movement for all EU citizens after the UK leaves the Union.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Act I can say nothing publicly which might identify the persons making the disclosures and I cannot comment on the accuracy or otherwise of reports which have appeared in the media about the nature of these disclosures.  It is vitally important that the claims of people making such disclosures are properly addressed.  It is also important to ensure that the rights of such individuals to fairness and proper procedures is provided for. </p>  <p>  Having consulted with the Attorney General, I asked Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, a former Judge of the High Court, having regard to the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Act, 2014, to:</p>  <p>  - review allegations of wrongdoing contained in the disclosures</p>  <p>  - make any inquiries with persons or bodies that he considers appropriate in relation to the review</p>  <p>  - report to me within six weeks on the conclusion of the review including any recommendations which he may consider necessary in relation to any further action which may be appropriate and warranted to address the allegations.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend these terms of reference.  On conclusion of the review and in light of any recommendations I will consider what further steps may be necessary.</p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints/allegations are fully investigated, I wrote to the Policing Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints/allegations in a safe environment where their complaints/allegations are properly investigated.</p>  <p>  While there have been significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures, the Deputy will appreciate that I will consider very carefully the report from the Policing Authority when it is available.</p></reply>

The Reserve perform policing  duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;.  Their role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas.  Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;.  In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected</p><p>As I announced earlier this week the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has been provided for the recruitment in 2017 of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300 in 2017.</p><p>I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner in relation to the delivery of the commitment to double the Reserve to 2,000 and what steps might be taken to ensure that the expanded Reserve is used to best effect in support of visible policing.  In this regard, I welcome the recent assignment by the Commissioner of a Superintendent to head up the Garda Reserve Management Office.  I understand that that Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve.  It has also started work on the development of a recruitment plan with the objective of recruiting and training 300 new Reserves annually starting next year, to bring the strength of the Reserve up from its current strength of 789 members to 2,000.  As part of the planning process, I understand that the Office is examining the possibility of recruitment at the regional or divisional level, rather than centrally, and also the manner in which the training is delivered.</p><p>Recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute;  to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involves a competitive process undertaken by PAS on behalf of the Commissioner and, for successful candidates, further fitness, medical and vetting tests undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013.  Under these regulations the age ceiling at which any candidate may apply to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a full time member is set at not more than 35 years and there are currently no plans to change this regulation.  <font color="#000080">  </font></p><p>The Regulations provide that special recognition may be given to Reserve members in the context of the selection process as they have undergone training in many of the skills required to be an effective full-time member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have gained experience in operational policing.  The recruitment campaign for 2016 included for the first time a special stream for eligible members of the Reserve.  This special steam was continued in the most recent campaign announced on 8 September 2016.  To be eligible for the special Reserve stream a reserve member is required to have completed their probation, performed their role to a satisfactory standard, and served a minimum of 150 hours per year for two of the previous four years.  The Reserve stream is essentially a fast-track stream in that it allows the eligible reserves to skip stage 1 (unsupervised on-line tests) of the competitive assessment process and move straight to stage 2 which consists of supervised assessment tests taken in an assessment centre.  Those who meet the required standard are then called to a competency based interview.  Successful candidates are then fast tracked through the medical, fitness and vetting assessments undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first successful candidates to enter the Garda College from the 2016 recruitment campaign last June were all from the Reserve stream.</p><p>As I have already stated the Reserves consists of voluntary unpaid members.  Reserve members who work a minimum of 208 hours in a 12 month period receive a non-taxable allowance of &euro;1,000 per annum as a contribution towards their expenses.  They are also reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending court in respect of their service as a Reserve member.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>The  Commissioner, with the aim of recognising the efforts of the Reserves and increasing their visibility within the organisation, is introducing an annual event to recognise them.  This is a very welcome initiative and I understand that the first such event, to take place 10 years since the inauguration of the Reserve, is scheduled for 12th December 2016.</p></reply>

The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p>  <p>  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and the need to provide for adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on a review of policy in the insurance sector which is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments and Agencies.  The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  As part of that Review, I have established the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by the Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D.  This Working Group is examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The Working Group, which is focussing initially on the issues of rising motor insurance premiums, is due to provide me with an initial set of recommendations at the end of this month.  From November to December, the Working Group will then develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions.  It is my view that the implementation of the action plan will also have an impact on other areas of  non-life insurance.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that I have not ruled out the possibility of the existing Cost of Insurance Working Group looking at other non-life insurance sectors if it is clear that there are separate and distinct issues which need particular examination in order to improve the functioning and regulation of these parts of the market.</p></reply>

Consequently,</p>  <p>  I have established a Cost of Insurance Working Group chaired by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D.  This Working Group consists of a number of relevant Government Departments, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the State Claims Agency.  The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.</p>  <p>  The core areas to be examined by the Working Group in the first phase are:</p>  <p>  - The motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years;</p>  <p>  - The effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs;</p>  <p>  - The current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims;</p>  <p>  - Insurance data and information;</p>  <p>  - The impact of accident rates;</p>  <p>  - The impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector; and</p>  <p>  - Other market issues.</p>  <p>  Because the issue of the cost of insurance is complex and in order to get to the heart of these issues as soon as possible, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D. has established four sub-groups to review them in detail.  Chairs have been appointed to these sub-groups and work has already commenced.  The sub-groups are meeting weekly and their outputs will feed into the meetings of the Working Group.  The Working Group has held five meetings to date and will continue to meet every two to three weeks to the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  The consultation process has commenced. Minister of State Murphy has had informal meetings with representatives from a number of key stakeholders including: Insurance Ireland, AA Ireland, the Injuries Board, the Irish Brokers Association, IBEC, FBD Insurance, and the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Working Group and the four sub-groups are also meeting with the relevant stakeholders.  The Working Group has met with representatives from the Law Society, AA Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Irish Car Rental Council, the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Consumers Association of Ireland.  Further consultations will be arranged.  In addition, submissions received from all interested parties will be considered as part of the process.</p>  <p>  By the end of October, the Working Group will provide me with an update report which will set out the priority actions required.  From November to December, the Working Group will then develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions.</p></reply>

He shall control all disbursements and shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and shall report to D&aacute;il Eireann at stated periods to be determined by law" and the Comptroller and Auditor General Act of 1923, which specified the appointment of "a Comptroller-General of the Receipt and Issue of the Exchequer of Saorst&aacute;t Eireann and Auditor-General of Public Accounts who shall be styled and known as the Comptroller and Auditor-General (&Aacute;rd-Scr&uacute;d&oacute;ir) and who shall act on behalf of Saorst&aacute;t Eireann."</p>  <p>  The Act also states that "The Minister for Finance shall from time to time appoint the officers, clerks, and other persons in the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and regulate the numbers, salaries and conditions of employment of the respective grades or classes into which such officers, clerks, and other persons shall be divided."  It should be noted, however, that the Act gave the Comptroller and Auditor "full power to make from time to time orders and rules for the conduct of the internal business of his Department and to promote, suspend, or remove any of the officers, clerks, and other persons employed therein, and also, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations and prescribe forms for the guidance of departments and persons in making up and rendering their accounts to him for examination."</p>  <p>  Further the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is not among those listed as being among the branches of administration assigned to the Department of Finance in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, an act often regarded as the founding document of the Department of Finance.  The Comptroller and Auditor General Act of 1923 and the more recent Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 are the principal legislative instruments governing the C&amp;AG.

The section 110 regime is not viewed as a tax expenditure and has not been included as same in reports that my Department have published relating to tax expenditures alongside the last two Budgets.  As the section 110 regime is not viewed as a tax expenditure no ex-post or ex-ante evaluations have been required or carried out in respect of the regime.</p><p>The rationale for not deeming section 110 a tax expenditure is due to the fact that is part of our normal tax structure.  It is the legal framework for Ireland's securitisation industry which is a key feature of tax regimes internationally.  Section 110 sets out a regime for the taxation of special purpose companies set up to securitise assets.  The tax provisions are intended to ring-fence the use of section 110 companies for bona-fide securitisation purposes and structured finance purposes.</p><p>The features of the regime are that:</p><p>- The company must be tax resident in Ireland and carry on the business of holding or managing &quot;qualifying assets&quot;;</p><p>- &quot;Qualifying assets&quot; for Section 110 purposes includes a broad range of financial and other assets including shares, bonds, derivatives, loans, deposits, commodities, plant and machinery and invoices and other types of receivable;</p><p>- The value of &quot;qualifying assets&quot; must be at least &euro;10 Million at the time they are acquired by the Section 110 company;</p><p>- Apart from the holding or managing of the &quot;qualifying assets&quot; the company cannot carry on any other activities.</p></reply>

The EU VAT Directive provides that VAT registration thresholds may only be raised by Member States to maintain their value in real terms, that is, they may only be increased in line with inflation.  The VAT thresholds were increased to their current values on 1 May 2008.  As the Central Statistics Office figures show the consumer price index is below the level it reached in 2008, it is not possible to increase the thresholds.  I would point out, however, that Ireland's VAT registration threshold for small enterprises supplying services is the seventh highest in the EU while the goods threshold is the third highest.</p></reply>

Its terms of reference are as follows:</p>  <p>  To examine and develop proposals for measures in the areas of taxation, PRSI and levies, for Budget and Finance Bill within agreed Government parameters for the overall Budget position and in the context of the framework of a medium term and longer term strategy set out in the Government's programme; and</p>  <p>  To examine the strategic approach for a general social welfare package and to assess the interaction of income tax/PRSI/levies proposals with social welfare proposals including child income support, and in particular the impact of this interaction on the labour market and income distribution.</p>  <p>  Papers on various options for tax policy changes are prepared annually for the Group by Department of Finance officials, Papers relating to PRSI and social welfare issues are also prepared for the Group by the Department of Social Protection.  In previous years these Papers were published after the Budget.  However, in line with the Government's commitment to Budgetary reform including greater engagement with the Oireachtas, the current Tax Strategy Group papers were published in July this year.  This was well in advance of Budget 2017 and helped to facilitate informed discussion.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Tax Strategy Group is not a decision-making body and the papers produced are a list of options and issues.  They are only one part of an overall Budgetary and Finance Bill process which now includes the National Economic Dialogue, the Budget Oversight Committee and the provision of pre-Budget submissions and engagement with specific groups and individuals.  Close to 300 such submissions were received in advance of Budget 2017.  This provides opportunities for the views of external individuals and groups to be heard on general Budgetary and specific Finance Bill matters. </p>  <p>  I would not consider it appropriate to broaden the membership of the Group to external practitioners. Where there are specific Finance Bill issues to be addressed there is and can be formal and informal engagement with officials in my Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  There is also provision for engagement with the Revenue Commissioners on taxation issues through the TALC.  These engagements are of course subject in certain cases to the requirements of lobbying legislation.</p></reply>

The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) (Amendment) Act 2013, provided the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with the power to make regulations that set out the specific details of the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme.  These regulations are contained in SI 124 of 2014.</p><p>Chapter 1 &ndash; Sick Leave Scheme, Employment Terms and Conditions for Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools &ndash; Edition 1 issued by my Department sets out the detailed conditions for granting of sick leave, to Registered Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools and provides for the following:</p><p>- A maximum of 3 months (92 days) on full pay in a year;</p><p>- Followed by a maximum of 3 months (91 days) on half pay;</p><p>- Subject to a maximum of 6 months (183 days) paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.</p><p>A teacher who becomes incapacitated as a result of a critical illness or serious physical injury may be granted extended paid sick leave.  Paragraph 1.2 of the Sick Leave Scheme states &quot;A period of illness is defined as any period in which a teacher is medically unfit to carry out his/her full duties irrespective of whether the employing school is open for normal business or not&quot;.  Where a primary teacher is absent on continuous sick leave of more than three consecutive school days, a medical certificate is required.</p><p>Circular Letter 0032/2007 sets out the provisions regarding brief absences for Teachers in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools.  Special leave with pay is allowed to a teacher in the event of the bereavement of a family member which is defined as follows:</p><p><b>-</b>Immediate family &ndash; spouse/partner, father, mother, step-father, step-mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, step-son and step-daughter - Five consecutive days including a weekend.</p><p>- Near relative &ndash; grandparent, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, grandchild, first cousin &ndash; Maximum of three consecutive days including a weekend. </p></reply>

Budget 2017 represents the start of a major programme of reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.</font></p><p><font color="#333333">  The Action Plan outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019.  One of the actions as part of the plan is to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</font><font color="#333333">The plan also integrates with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase capitation funding and to set out capitation rates to schools on a rolling 3-year basis, allowing for forward planning by schools.</font></p><p>It was not possible to provide additional funding in Budget 2017 in relation to this element of the Action Plan due to the many competing demands for the available funding.  However, this commitment remains a priority for me as soon as possible to address during the lifetime of the Action Plan. </p><p><font color="#333333">My Department's position in relation to voluntary contributions is that they are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay.  I have no plans to alter this position so long as schools ensure that the contributions are sought in a manner that makes this clear to all concerned.</font></p><p><font color="#333333">  Separately, the Deputy will be aware that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published on 6</font><font color="#333333">July 2016, contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.</font></p><p>I also intend to introduce a stronger complaints procedure and a charter for parents.  It is important that schools should consult parents on matters relating to their children's education, including those matters which have cost implications, and schools should be responsive to the views and concerns of parents.  In that regard requiring schools to have a parent charter will ensure that schools will interact better with parent associations and with individual parents.</p><p>I will shortly seek Government approval for the Heads of a Bill to provide for replacing Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998 and the drafting of principles which will form the framework of a Parents' and Learners' Charter in every school.</p></reply>

The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.

Pillar 3, entitled Build More Homes, has a key objective of increasing the output of private housing to meet demand at affordable prices.  Pillar 4 deals with the Rental Sector and includes the development of a new affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of their disposable income on rent.</p></reply>

Under section 10 of the 1981 Act, a fire authority, in this case Meath County Council, is required to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises.  In general, I have no role in relation to the detailed operational matters, such as local mobilisation procedures and staffing arrangements, referred to in the question and queries on these should be referred to the local authority concerned.</p><p>In relation to Fire Service mobilisation, my Department has provided information and analysis to assist individual fire services in improving response times by giving effect to the principle of &ldquo;mobilising the nearest available response&rdquo;.  While this principle applies across most of the country already, the evidence suggests that up to 5% of the population would benefit from a re-alignment of the sequence of mobilisation of fire service resources from fire stations using the &ldquo;nearest available response&rdquo; rather than traditional administrative or &ldquo;station ground&rdquo; boundaries.  Any query in relation to the application of the principle of &ldquo;nearest available response&rdquo; in Meath is a matter for Meath County Council. </p><p>In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive, under the Local Government Act 2001, to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the local authorities. </p><p>My Department operated a delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation of the moratorium on recruitment in relation to local authorities.  The Department examined all staffing sanction requests on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints.  In considering sanction requests, public safety, maintaining key front line services and economic considerations we re given precedence.  Fire-fighter numbers in Ireland, including in Meath, were maintained at a constant level from the introduction of the moratorium in 2009 until its removal in December 2015.  Since the lifting of the moratorium, my Department has received no application for additional posts in the Meath Fire Service.  As staff in Fire Service are public servants, their remuneration and salaries are governed by relevant national pay arrangements including the Lansdowne Road Agreement, which runs to 2018.</p><p>As part of a 2016&ndash;2020 capital investment programme in fire service infrastructure, some projects in Meath are scheduled to receive support from my Department.  This investment will help maintain a quality infrastructure and ensure that fire stations, the fire service appliance fleet and equipment and mobilisation and communications facilities in Meath are in line with national norms. </p><p>Fire Service statistics, including those relating to call-outs, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Details relating specifically to call-outs in County Meath for the period 2011 - 2015 are set out in Table 1.</p><p><b><i>Table 1</i></b></p><p><b><i>Details of</i></b><b><i>Meath</i></b><b><i>Fire Service Call-outs 2011 - 2015</i></b><table><tr><th>Meath </th><th>Fire </th><th>Non-Fire# </th><th>False </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>609 </td><td>238 </td><td>261 </td><td>1108 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>534 </td><td>235 </td><td>246 </td><td>1015 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>558 </td><td>213 </td><td>75 </td><td>846 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>331 </td><td>50 </td><td>63 </td><td>444 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>841 </td><td>328 </td><td>50 </td><td>1219 </td></tr></table># Hazardous Substances, Rescues, RTA's etc.</p></reply>

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.</p>  <p>  Good agricultural practice involves the land spreading of organic fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water courses and groundwaters.  In accordance with the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, the Regulations include provisions regarding periods when the land application of certain types of fertilisers is prohibited.  In addition, the Regulations prohibit such application at any time of the year when the ground is frozen, waterlogged or heavy rain is forecast.   </p>  <p>  Specified closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a key aspect of the Nitrates Regulations.  They are a requirement of the Nitrates Directive and are mandatory in every Member State.  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was being introduced.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice.  The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s on-going Agricultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the prohibited spreading periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters.</p>  <p>  The Nitrates Action Programme will be reviewed again in 2017 and my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is now commencing the review process prior to formal engagement with the European Commission.  The ultimate aim of the review process is to gain approval for a 4th Nitrates Action Programme for Ireland by the end of 2017, including the renewal of Ireland&rsquo;s derogation.  An important aspect of the review process will be a public consultation exercise in early 2017.</p>  <p>  Ireland faces considerable challenges in meeting the requirements of the Water Framework Directive to bring all waters back to good status at least.  Taking those challenges and the evidence in support of the benefit of closed periods into consideration I have no plans at present to extend the spreading periods for organic fertilisers in 2016 but am monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

This allows a housing authority to consider a victim of domestic violence as having a housing need and to be placed on a housing list, subject to the household meeting all other eligibility criteria.</p><p>Where a victim of domestic violence applies for social housing support in their own right while still a joint tenant, it is a matter for the relevant local authority to address the contractual issues arising in relation to the joint tenancy agreement.

The use of a means test is to ensure that resources are directed to those in greatest need.</p>  <p>  Payments from the United Kingdom (UK) are assessed as income under current legislation.  If the person applying for a State Pension non-contributory has a UK pension, it is assessable, together with all other means such as savings and investments, when determining the rate of payment.  In assessing means derived from payments received from non-European Monetary Union (EMU) States, the Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers.  Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter.  This rate is then used in all conversions during the course of the succeeding quarter.  The exchange rates for converting sterling and other non EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union, and take account of currency fluctuations.  The Department obtains this rate at the beginning of each quarter.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of the UK referendum, negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU will take time.  In the interim, it is important to stress that all payments made by the Department of Social Protection, including those to recipients who are resident in Britain and Northern Ireland, and payments from the UK to residents in Ireland, will continue to be paid.</p>  <p>  My Department is keeping the currency situation under review.  It is open to any person in receipt of a social assistance payment to request that his/her entitlement be reviewed if they wish.  It is important to note, however, that any such review will involve a full reassessment of all of the customer&rsquo;s means to ensure that the person continues to receive the correct payment in line with their overall entitlement.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As I pointed out in my earlier reply, the aim is to create a supportive environment to allow for disclosures of wrongdoing to be made in the public interest rather than providing financial incentives for whistle-blowing, which may entail certain negative incentives, as I described.  In so far as there may be a case to introduce financial rewards into our uniform and generally applicable regime, and whether and how this would be linked to any recoupment of funds by the Exchequer.

It is open to the Councils to undertake any local flood mitigation works using their own resources or, if necessary, to submit an application for funding under the Office of Public Works' (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection scheme.</p><p>To date in 2016, the OPW has approved funding of &euro;200,130 to Monaghan County Council under the above scheme in respect of proposed projects at Drummillard/Lakeview, Castleblaney (&euro;37,530),Corleck/Annahaia (&euro;15,000 for study), Donaghmoyne (&euro;85,500), Bunnoe River (&euro;40,500 for study) and Edengilrevy (&euro;21,600).</p><p>Applications for funding from Monaghan County Council in respect of two other proposed projects at Cornawall, Doohat and at Munmurry, Glaslough are still being assessed by OPW engineering staff.  No applications for funding from Cavan County Council are currently to hand in the OPW.</p><p>All applications for funding under the Minor Works administrative scheme are assessed in accordance with the eligibility criteria for the scheme which includes a requirement that all proposed works are cost beneficial and subject to the availability of funding for flood risk management.  The eligibility criteria for the scheme are published on the OPW's website<i>www.opw.ie.</i></p><p>The OPW only funds drainage works related to fluvial or river flooding.  Any necessary works to address flooding caused by pluvial or inadequate surface water drainage systems are the responsibility of the local authority.  The local authority is responsible also for the ongoing maintenance of certain watercourses within Drainage Districts in the county.</p><p>The OPW carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500 km of river channel and approximately 730 km of embankments nationally.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands.  The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.</p><p>The planned OPW maintenance programme in Co Cavan in 2016 includes work on some 18 km on the Inny scheme, approximately 7 km on the Boyne scheme and 3 km of the Glyde and Dee scheme.</p><p>The planned OPW maintenance programme in Co Monaghan in 2016 includes work on approximately 65 km of the Monaghan Blackwater Arterial Drainage Scheme and some 35 km of the Glyde and Dee scheme.</p></reply>

The review was undertaken by Dr Niall Herity, a highly respected, Belfast based NHS cardiologist.  It is a comprehensive report which reflects the fact that Dr Herity consulted widely and met with all of the key stakeholders including the management and staff of both UHW and Cork University Hospital.</p>  <p>   Dr Herity has made clear recommendations that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified and I accept this.  However, he also recommends investing in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology services including increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided, in order to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  He also recommends that new specialist equipment be provided to improve contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure.  I am happy to provide the additional resources necessary to implement these recommendations.  This investment will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan for 2017.  During this period of investment and enhancement of services, the situation will be closely monitored.  A further independent review will be carried out in early 2017 to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending the cath lab.</p>  <p>  Dr Herity also recommends that some services be provided elsewhere.  I want to be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access to a 24/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017. </p>  <p>  I intend to visit UHW next month and I will take the opportunity to speak with staff and management on a broad range of issues.  With regard to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is an operational matter I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the CCCs with their work with childminders.</p>  <p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in the majority of areas.  The funding of the 30 CCCs was also reduced as part of expenditure reviews in recent years.  However, the CCCs continue to provide valuable services at local level and supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to some level of support, training and advice.</p>  <p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers, including childminders, at local level.  In 2016, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;10.4m.  In addition, in 2016 my Department provided &euro;250,000 to the CCCs for disbursement to eligible childminders by way of Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.44m in 2016, to six National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;340,000 for Childminding Ireland (CMI), the representative body for childminders.  This national association supports quality development in family based care for children.  It supports parents with childcare choices and concerns and also childminders.</p>  <p>  Under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, services providing care for children aged 0-6 years who have not yet commenced primary school are required to register their service with the Early Years (Pre-School) Inspectorate in Tusla, and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time, temporary, overnight, and sessional services, as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations.</p>  <p>  My Department has asked Childminding Ireland to chair a working group on reforms and supports for the childminding sector.

The ABC Programme commenced in 2013 and was co-funded for the period 2013 to 2017 in the amount of &euro;29.7m.  The programme is managed by CES and Pobal on behalf of the funders.  The aim the programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches in areas of disadvantage in Ireland to improve outcomes for children, in particular children and families living in poverty.  The focus of the work under the ABC Programme covers: Child Health &amp;amp; Development; Children&rsquo;s Learning; Parenting; and Integrated Service Delivery.</p><p>There are 13 sites across Ireland participating in the ABC programme.  Eight of these are based in Dublin: CDI Tallaght; Preparing for Life; Youngballymun; Clondalkin Behavioural Initiative; Better Finglas; Dublin Docklands and East Inner City; Grangegorman and Ballyfermot.  The remaining five sites are located in Cork; Louth; Bray; Limerick and the Midlands. </p><p>Prior to the ABC Programme, the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) ran from 2007-2013 and it funded the following three organisations which transitioned into the ABC programme: Youngballymun, Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght, and the Preparing for Life Programme Darndale.  The other ABC sites are funded through the following lead agencies or consortia: Clondalkin Behavioural Initiative; Louth Leader Partnership; Barnardos; National College of Ireland; Bray Area Partnership; Northside Community Health Initiative (Cork) Ltd; Dublin Institute of Technology; Ballyfermot/Chapelizod Partnership and People Action Against Unemployment Ltd.</p><p>The services provided by the ABC sites in each area are set out in the table.  These services include parenting supports and interventions, early years practitioner and primary teacher training and the delivery of programmes to expectant mothers, parents of infants and children and their parents from the early years upwards.</p><p>The Government is fully committed to ensuring that learning from all sites funded under the ABC programme will inform other services and supports for children in the area of prevention and early intervention.  Such an approach would offer a greater reach, in scope and depth, which will in turn enhance outcomes for children throughout the country.  As there is effective work being done on a range of themes across all 13 ABC sites, a key focus over the next year will be to determine the high-impact programmes and provision across these areas so that a more strategic approach can be taken to mainstreaming such learning. </p><p><b>ABC Programme &ndash;

This top-up payment originated in the transition from the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) funding to the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) and was ostensibly to support rurally isolated service providers with small numbers of children to maintain viability.  </p>  <p>  However, the introduction of CCS, CETS and ECCE necessitated a review of this support.  In order to receive the subsidy a service must meet specific criteria and be unable to sustain operations without a guaranteed minimum funding level.</p>  <p>  The combined level of funding, from all childcare programmes administered by the Department, must not exceed &euro;20,000 or a pro-rata amount linked to the number of weeks open if less than 50.  There are no plans to add new services at this time.</p>  <p>  Those childcare services in receipt of this top-up payment are made aware the payment remains under review each year.</p></reply>
