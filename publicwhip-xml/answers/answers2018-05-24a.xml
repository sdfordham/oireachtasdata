    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-24a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400048#WRA00600"><p>My Department, through its agency Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices, supports companies in urban and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future. On an annual basis, Enterprise Ireland works with approximately 5,000 companies through a network of market and sector advisers based across 10 national offices and 33 international offices. These manufacturing and internationally traded services companies are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland. </p><p>Brexit presents the most significant economic challenge of the past 50 years, and it is important that we prepare for any long-term structural and disruptive change that may emerge.  Being prepared is crucial to ensure resilience to emerging challenges.  To promote awareness, and supported by a national <i>Prepare For Brexit</i>campaign, Enterprise Ireland designed and launched a &euro;5k <i>Be Prepared Grant</i>that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit.  This grant is demand led, and I am confident that Enterprise Ireland has the budgetary resources to meet the needs of all eligible companies who apply for the Grant.  To date, 106 Be Prepared Grants have been approved to Enterprise Ireland client companies.  </p><p>I have also launched a Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme in April 2018, which will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses. My officials are examining policy proposals for a new longer-term Business Investment Loan Scheme to support businesses. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland will continue to promote and develop supports across all counties and regions to ensure that the maximum number of clients are engaged in preparing for the impact of Brexit. These additional schemes include the Strategic Consultancy Grant supports the hiring of an outside consultant to assist the company in devising and/or implementing strategic initiatives aimed at improving business function and resilience. It is designed to facilitate business growth as the consultants can act as coach, mentor, facilitator, analyst, negotiator and/or operator for the company.  Up to 50% of the costs incurred in hiring a consultant are available up to a maximum grant amount of &euro;35,000. </p><p>The Market Discovery Fund provides support to companies to assist them in researching the viability of exporting in new or existing markets. The maximum funding is 50% of eligible expenditure up to a maximum grant of &euro;150,000. </p><p>EI is continuing to work with companies to help them to become more innovative. The Agile Innovation Fund is an RD&amp;amp;I grant aimed at clients in sectors with rapid design cycles. The application process is simple and quick, with a short timeframe between application and approval. </p><p>EI has also rolled out a number of Brexit Advisory Clinics across the country which helps companies to examine their exposure to Brexit and develop effective strategies to mitigate against that exposure. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland has also introduced the Brexit: Act On initiative.  Under the initiative an independent consultant helps companies to decide on specific actions that they can implement over a short period to enable them to address the risks and avail of the opportunities caused by Brexit. </p></reply>

It is a key action to support the Regional Action Plans for Jobs and the Action Plan for Rural Development.</p><p>The first call under the Fund was announced in May 2017, with the results released in December 2017. Twenty-one applicants representing all regions of the country secured a total of up to &euro;30.5m in financial support for a range of enterprise and capability development projects.</p><p>Minister Humphreys launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) on 16th April 2018 with a closing date of 28th June 2018.  This call will fund projects with the balance of the &euro;60m remaining under the fund.  The criteria for the second call remains the same as that set out for the first call.</p><p>A maximum of up to 80% is available for projects, with the balance to be leveraged from the private, community or public sector.</p><p>The Fund will support major new collaborative and innovative initiatives that can make a significant impact on enterprise development in the region/across regions or nationally to build the unique potential, strengths and capabilities to grow the regions.  Projects must be impactful, with the key impact focus being sustainable job creation.</p><p>The fund will consist of 4 streams, as follows:</p><p><b>Stream 1: Major Regional Change Projects </b></p><p>Investment of &euro;2m up to &euro;5m per project (with a minimum of 20% to be leveraged from the private, community or public sector) for major initiatives with high-impact on enterprise development of the region and ability to create jobs, for example in specialized incubators; hubs in design; and initiatives in areas such as medical devices,  fintech, agri-tech and food etc.</p><p><b>Stream 2: Regionally Significant Change Projects </b></p><p>Investment of &euro;250,000 up to &euro;2m per project (with a minimum of 20% to be leveraged from the private, community or public sector) for initiatives with high impact at regional/multi-regional level.

My Department has also provided additional funding to IDA Ireland to support exporting businesses that may be impacted by Brexit and to compete for new investment opportunities that may arise on foot of Brexit.  </p><p>EI has launched several initiatives in response to Brexit, including:</p><p>- Brexit Scorecard: This interactive online platform can be used by  all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six  business pillars.</p><p>- Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SMEs up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an appropriate Brexit action plan.</p><p>- Brexit Advisory Clinics: Recently held in Laois, Mayo, Cavan and  Cork. The next Clinic will be in Dublin's Aviva Stadium on 21 June.</p><p>- Brexit 'Act On' Programme: This funding is to support the engagement of a consultant to draw up a report with  tailored recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and become more resilient. </p><p>In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focused on global and sectoral opportunities, further developing in-market expertise and networks, placing greater focus on identifying new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns. In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020. </p><p>The LEOs are supporting their clients by providing information, training and mentoring on Brexit related issues as well as advice on other sources of support. </p><p>InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce.  A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months. ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p><p>Other initiatives that my Department are advancing include the &euro;300 million Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms. </p><p>The work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future. All our efforts are aimed at supporting businesses to diversify and compete and to ensure that Ireland will be in a strong position in case of a hard Brexit scenario. </p></reply>

I will certainly be focused on doing everything I can to deliver the fairest possible spread of investment across the country.  Total employment by FDI companies in Ireland now stands at a landmark 210,443 people which is an increase of 5.3% from 2016. This figure surpasses the overall five-year target of 209,000 which was set in the IDA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; strategy. The fact that the IDA has now, only three years into their five-year strategy, reached its total job creation target for that period demonstrates how strong Ireland&rsquo;s FDI offering continues to be for multinationals. This is the highest level of employment from overseas firms in the history of the State and will deliver wide-ranging economic benefits for the people of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Government is also working to ensure a more even distribution of FDI across the country. Last year, IDA Ireland delivered 99 regional investments with 45% of new jobs created outside Dublin. The last three years has seen 30,000 new FDI jobs created outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that overseas firms consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland, including County Wexford. It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned. </p>  <p>  Wexford has developed a strong base of overseas investment, with 18 IDA client companies employing a total of 2,948 people there. Employment in these firms is also growing, as evidenced by the 10% job growth figure achieved from 2016 to 2017. Total employment in overseas companies in the South-East Region now stands at 14,785 people in 75 client companies. The IDA continues to engage with its client base to help support further employment and investment growth in Wexford and the wider South-East region.</p>  <p>  The IDA currently has both sites and buildings available for investment in Wexford. These include lands at the IDA Business &amp;amp; Technology Park and Whitemill Industrial Estate in Wexford Town and at the IDA Business Park in Enniscorthy. Buildings are also available at the IDA Business Park in Enniscorthy and the Whitemill Industrial Estate. </p>  <p>  The Agency continues to draw the attention of investors considering locating or expanding in the South East to these different properties. It will also keep the property situation in Wexford under review to help ensure that companies can find the facilities or buildings they need in order to generate jobs and investment for the people of the wider area. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-24a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400048#WRA02200"><p>This Government has made jobs and enterprise in the regions a top priority.</p><p>The Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJs) initiative is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, 135,000 of which are outside of Dublin. A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p><p>The Plans are being monitored and driven in each region by Implementation Committees, comprising representatives from the private sector, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, and other public bodies in the region.</p><p>Some of the actions set out in the RAPJs require active engagement with, and the development of networks within, the private sector. To drive this process, key industry figures have been appointed to act as Enterprise Champions within each Region. </p><p>Progress to date is good and employment continues to grow strongly. </p><p>The reporting of progress on actions under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs is coordinated by my Department in conjunction with the Regional Implementation Committees, Programme Managers and Secretariats. This information is collated through an online reporting tool, managed by my Department. Each Action in the RAPJ has a nominated &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the Action, depending on its area of focus. Across the original eight Regional Action Plan for Jobs, there were 1,276 actions in total.</p><p>To date, my Department has published two Progress Reports per Region, with the third and fourth Progress Reports currently being finalised. The fourth Progress Reports will be final reports under the current iteration of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, closing out the narratives on Actions for the 2015 &ndash; 2017. </p><p>Building on the momentum of the 2015-2017 Plans, my focus, and that of my Department will now turn to the refresh and refocus of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs through to 2020 which will place an emphasis on delivering to a smaller number of key strategic objectives in support of enterprise and job creation in every region. The refreshed Plans will capitalize on the added value that comes from collaborative action where for example there is: a particular (sectoral) opportunity for the region; a barrier to enterprise investment and or entrepreneurial activity; and/or a regional vulnerability that needs to be responded to. </p><p>In the second Progress Reports, on actions up to the end of 2016, the following was recorded for each Region:</p><p><b>South-West:</b></p><p>248 of the South West Action Plan&rsquo;s 261 actions were due to be initiated or completed by the end of 2016. 237 of these were on track to be delivered, or had been completed. 4 actions were delayed; 7 actions were no longer being progressed or had been deemed unfeasible. This represented an overall implementation rate of 95%.</p><p><b>West:</b></p><p>179 of the West Action Plan&rsquo;s 194 actions were due to be initiated or completed by the end of 2016. 175 of these were on track to be delivered, or had been completed. 4 actions were delayed; 2 actions were no longer being progressed, or had been deemed unfeasible. This represented an overall implementation rate of 97%.</p><p><b>South-East:</b></p><p>165 of the South-East Action Plan&rsquo;s 190 actions were due to be initiated or completed by the end of 2016. 162 of these are on track to be delivered, or had been completed and 3 actions were delayed or no longer being progressed. This represented an overall implementation rate of 98%.</p><p><b>Midlands:</b></p><p>By the second half of 2016, 92 of the Midland Action Plan&rsquo;s 121 actions were due to be initiated or completed. Some 84 of these were on track to be delivered, or had been completed. 4 actions were delayed while another 4 were no longer being progressed or had been deemed unfeasible.

The EU remains committed to the continued full and effective implementation of the JCPOA.  The lifting of sanctions against Iran under the JCPOA has led to a positive impact on trade and economic relations with Iran, and its commitment to ensuring that this can continue to be delivered in the interests of improved geo-political stability.</p>  <p>  Form a trade perspective, Iran, with a population of 80 million, and a relatively wealthy middle class, is a potential growth market worthy of further exploration for Irish exporters.  However, I agree that the recent announcements by the US Administration are likely to have a negative effect on this growth potential, in particular if the US imposes sanctions on European companies that do business in Iran following their withdrawal from the Agreement.</p>  <p>  According to CSO figures, Irish goods exports to Iran nearly doubled from &euro;72 million in 2016 to &euro;143 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase of &euro;67m in the General Industrial Machinery category.  However exports to Iran are a very small proportion of Ireland's total global goods exports - amounting to only 0.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s total goods exports in 2017.</p>  <p>  Goods imports from Iran to Ireland increased from &euro;1.6 million in 2016 to &euro;3.5 million in 2017.  According to the CSO, there is no services trade with Iran.  </p>  <p>  According to CSO data, there is no Iranian foreign direct investment into Ireland. There are no Iranian companies in the IDA portfolio at present.  IDA Ireland is maintaining constant contact with their client base in relation to any potential impacts the sanctions may have and the Agency will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  Despite the alleviation of sanctions under the JCPOA, there remain practical difficulties for Irish businesses seeking to do business in Iran.  The continuance of some US financial sanctions has meant that European banks - including Irish institutions - have been cautious with regard to engaging in financial transactions with Iran.  In addition, Iran is often not included as a covered geographical territory for travel insurance and/or other types of business insurance, where the insurance company is from the US, or has a US mother company, and travelling to Iran negates the visa waiver for Irish passport holders travelling to the US.  </p>  <p>  Despite these difficulties, Enterprise Ireland has supported the efforts of Irish companies wishing to trade with Iran, while highlighting the practical difficulties of doing business there.  EI has previously brought trade delegations to Iran, and also held a 'Doing Business with Iran' Event in Dublin in July 2017, which 35 EI clients attended.  EI has also secured the services of an in-country Iranian market expert/pathfinder, to provide advice and assist EI clients WHO may encounter difficulties due to the re-imposition of sanctions or the threat of same.</p>  <p>  As regards client companies of EI, the precise consequences arising from the very recent announcement by the US Administration of its withdrawal from the JCPOA are still being analysed and EI, together with my Department, will keep the impacts on those companies under review.</p></reply>

The meeting further underscored Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the digital agenda and increased the visibility of Ireland as a digital front runner in Europe.</p>  <p>  The meeting focused on Artificial Intelligence and built on recent EU developments in this field. On 10 April last, I signed an EU political Declaration on Artificial Intelligence, which set out areas where agreement was reached by Member States for future cooperation. The European Commission has since followed up with a Communication on Artificial Intelligence, proposing a three-pronged approach to increase public and private investment in AI, prepare for socio-economic changes, and ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework. The D9+ meeting, which featured all eleven members of the group, will help to progress the development of policy in this emerging area.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a digital frontrunner because of its prominent ranking in the EU Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) Report. The European Commission published the 2018 DESI Report last Friday, which revealed that Ireland has moved up three places &ndash; to 6th from 9th &ndash; compared to 2017. This reflects improvements in basic and advanced digital skills; online transactions; and Irish people&rsquo;s use of internet services.</p></reply>

This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in. Despite improvements in Irish cost competitiveness, the openness of the economy means that the enterprise sector is particularly vulnerable to negative price and cost shocks which are outside the influence of domestic policymakers. Brexit also brings into sharp focus the importance of our cost competitiveness. </p>  <p>  Government is committed to take action to address unnecessarily high costs (i.e. cost and price levels not justified by productivity) wherever they arise. A range of initiatives set out in the Action Plan for Jobs are in train across Government Departments to improve the ease of doing business, reduce the administrative burden, enhance our cost competitiveness and productivity, and drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base. </p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support cost competitiveness. These stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies, other public bodies and the private sector. In this regard, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage the controllable portion of their respective cost bases, drive efficiency and continue to take action to address unnecessarily high costs. Such actions will ensure that improvements in relative cost competitiveness are more sustainable, leaving Ireland better positioned to cope with external shocks. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises that rising insurance costs for enterprise are an issue. For this reason, the Minister for Finance established the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016. In terms of my own Department&rsquo;s work, in December 2017, we published the First Report of the Personal Injuries Commission, which was established on foot of a recommendation from this Cost of Insurance Working Group. Implementation of the actions in the Report of the Personal Injuries Commission will help to bring more consistency to medical reporting and diagnosis of personal injuries, leading to a better functioning personal injuries environment in the future.</p>  <p>  The ongoing work of the Personal Injuries Commission, the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the complementary work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group should contribute to a better functioning personal injury litigation system and should also help to deliver reduced premiums for businesses.</p>  <p>  In terms of commercial rates, the levying and collection of rates is a matter for each individual local authority. The Department of Housing and Planning has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.  Among the measures included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support the implementation of policy objectives, including in: local economic and community plans; Development Plans and Local Area Plans; and national planning policies.</p>  <p>  The Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill. The General Scheme of the Bill is currently with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for drafting, with a view to its introduction as soon as possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-24a.36.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018052400048#WRA03500"><p>In 2011 and as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy to support growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive, the Government committed to raise gross investment in Research and Development to 2.5% of GNP by 2020. This commitment was reiterated in Innovation 2020 in 2015.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on Innovation, Research and Development consists of both public and private expenditure. Gross investment in R and D has since risen to &euro;3.2 billion in 2016. This is an increase of over half a billion euro since 2011. The estimated expenditure on R and D by Government Departments in 2017 is &euro;768 million. This represents an increase of almost &euro;40 million over 2016 and is the highest level of public expenditure on R&amp;D since 2012. </p>  <p>  A very significant part of our innovation policy has been to align public investment efforts in a manner that leverages R and D activity in the enterprise sectors. While private spending on R and D slowed during the financial crisis, it has been increasing steadily since 2011. Business Expenditure on R and D rose to &euro;2.3 billion in 2016 from &euro;1.7 billion in 2011, an increase of over 35%.</p>  <p>  Despite the fact that overall expenditure in R and D has increased every year since committing to Europe 2020 targets, reaching the 2.5% of GNP intensity rate target presents a very significant challenge. In 2016 our GNP intensity level stood at 1.43%, down from 1.91% in 2012. Even when using GNI* as a complementary indicator (GNI* removes globalisation impacts on the Irish economy), the R and D intensity rate is estimated at 1.72% for 2016. </p>  <p>  This is in part due to the strength of our economic performance and subsequent increases in GNP growth rates year on year over the last number of years. Our challenge is to increase the level of investment in R and D to keep pace with GNP growth rates, in the context of significant demands on the public purse.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of the R and D intensity rate, I am pleased to note that Ireland performs well in international comparison tables. European Commission analysis shows that, in aggregate terms, Ireland is one of the best innovation output performers, making it one of the most efficient performers overall in terms of outputs relative to investment.</p>  <p>  My Department is commencing an interim review of Innovation 2020 this year and this will give us the opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved under Innovation 2020 since December 2015 and will inform the development of its successor.</p></reply>

My priority as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation is to drive the creation of high-quality and sustainable jobs around all the regions and counties of Ireland, including Donegal.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) in Donegal is the first-stop-shop for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and soft supports such as training and mentoring to anyone wishing to start or grow a business. Funded by my Department, LEO Donegal plays a critical role in supporting microenterprises in the start-up and expansion phases.  </p>  <p>  The LEO Donegal has invested significantly in micro and small businesses by way of its core suite of supports since its establishment in 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, the LEO Donegal paid out over &euro;1.4 million in grant funding in respect of 121 projects. Clients supported with grant funding have consistently added new jobs with 100 new jobs supported in 2017 and 621 in total over the last 4 years. During this time, over 5,200 participants attended LEO training courses and 132 participants received mentoring. Furthermore, 211 applicants from the county entered the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition since it was launched in 2014.</p>  <p>  As you know, my Department secured an additional &euro;4m capital funding for the 31 LEOs for 2017 to fund a range of LEO Brexit supports across the country, including Donegal. This additional funding has been maintained for 2018. These supports are aimed at strengthening the capacity of micro and small businesses to better cope with the changing external environment, especially the impacts arising from Brexit. The supports include grants to assist LEO clients in diversifying their markets, targeted training and mentoring to address Brexit-related challenges and opportunities, as well as a Lean for Micro programme to help micro-enterprises to address competitive issues within their businesses by building the capability of their employees to identify problems and improve operations.</p>  <p>  The LEOs can also assist businesses in accessing other Government supports, for example, business loans from Microfinance Ireland or Trading Online Vouchers for businesses that want to improve their online sales. </p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs, launched in the North East/North West in November 2015, is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create more jobs in rural areas including Donegal. Under the Plan, the aim is to increase employment in the region by 10-15% over the period to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 28,000 jobs. 12,000 more people are in employment in the Border region from Q1 2015 to Q2 2017 representing good progress towards the target of 28,000 jobs by 2020. </p>  <p>  In May 2017, my Department with Enterprise Ireland launched the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) with funding of up to &euro;60m designed to support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs. The first call under this Fund concluded last August, with results announced on 11th December. Three projects across the North East/North West secured funding under the first call including Donegal Digital Innovation which will involve the creation of an innovation ecosystem in Inishowen, by delivering a 3-year enterprise capacity-building programme based on the peninsula&rsquo;s location factors, high tech skillsets and applied research potential in traditional sectors. </p>  <p>  The second call for projects under the Regional Fund opened for applications on Monday 16 April.</p>  <p>  Finally, my colleague Minister Ring has responsibility for the Action Plan for Rural Development which takes a whole-of-Government approach to the economic and social development of rural Ireland.  The Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies. The Plan seeks to support sustainable communities, support enterprise and employment, maximise our rural and recreation potential, foster culture and creativity, and improve rural connectivity.  A key objective of the Plan is to support sustainable communities through the enhancement of local services, in areas such as rural schools, post offices, and convenience shops.  </p></reply>

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p>  <p>  The North-East/North-West Regional Action Plan for Jobs has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region. Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders across counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of, the NE/NW Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The core objective of the NE/NW Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020. In terms of impact, 12,000 more people are in employment in the Border region from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, representing good progress towards the target of 28,000 jobs by 2020 as set out in the Regional Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Achievements in the North West under the Action Plan since 2015 include the establishment of a new precision engineering and manufacturing Technology Gateway at IT Sligo; the award of INTERREG funding to the North West Greenways Network, and the selection of 12 participants from the North West for Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s New Frontiers programme in 2017. At the end of 2016, as reported in the Second Progress Report, more than 90 percent of the actions in the North East/North West Action Plan were either on track for completion or complete. The third and fourth (final) progress reports are being finalized currently.</p>  <p>  In December last year I announced &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding. This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. On Monday 16th April, last I launched the second Call under the fund, making available the remainder of the &euro;60 million. </p>  <p>  Two of the successful projects involved participants from the North West region under Call 1 of the Fund: a network of three Digital and Innovation Hubs (which included one in Co. Leitrim); and a new Digital Innovation Hub and enterprise capacity building programme in Co. Donegal. </p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies continue their work to contribute towards the ambitious targets set out in the Regional Action Plan. Enterprise Ireland recently announced a 4% employment growth in its client companies for the Border region, which now employ almost 11,500 people. On the FDI front, the number of IDA-backed jobs grew by 4% as a whole last year, with almost 12,500 people now employed in IDA companies in the Border region. </p>  <p>  Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have supported 586 companies in the North West with 2,616 employees and last year LEO client companies in the North West added 190 new employees in total. </p>  <p>  Building on the progress and momentum of collaboration achieved to date through the Regional Action Plans 2015-2017 is my priority. On Monday, the 16th April last I met with the Chairs of the Regional APJ committees and other regional stakeholders, and together we have started a process to refresh and refocus all the Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. I look forward to working further with the regional stakeholders in the North-West to ensure we deliver to the employment targets for 2020 set out under the Regional Plans.</p></reply>

As the deputy will be aware, WRC inspectors, formerly NERA inspectors, routinely carry out inspections in all employment sectors, including in the social care sector, with a view to checking for and enforcing employment rights compliance by employers.  </p>  <p>  In the first instance, the WRC aims to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and, enforcement where necessary.  If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved and employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and/or pay money due to their employees, these cases are referred for further prosecution.</p>  <p>  The social care sector in Ireland comprises both public and private employers and in the period 2014 to 2017 the WRC Inspection Service has carried out inspections on an average of 80 premises per year in the Health and Child Care Sectors.  As a result of this activity, &euro;450,000 in unpaid wages has been recovered for workers in the sector in that period.</p>  <p>  In 2017 alone, inspections led to more that &euro;200,000 in unpaid wages being recovered across the health, nursing and childcare sector.  I understand that the WRC plans to maintain this level of activity in the sector for this year.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the resources of the WRC and the significant powers of the inspectors are sufficient to ensure that the rights of workers in the social care sector are enforced.</p></reply>

Given the size of the investment involved, and the subsequent issues encountered by the company throughout the planning process, IDA Ireland was in regular contact with its management throughout this time. The Agency, however, had no role in the independent planning process and court challenges in respect of it. As far as I am aware, Apple currently has not made any decisions in relation to the future of the site.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the Government, together with IDA Ireland, did everything it could to support this investment. This included high-level engagement with the company, both at home and abroad. The Taoiseach, for example, met with the firm&rsquo;s senior management in the USA in November 2017, where he made it clear that the project had the support of our Government and the local community in Athenry.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, in spite of these efforts, Apple has taken a commercial decision not to proceed, making it clear that the delays that beset this project caused them to reconsider their plans. As I have made clear, these delays have underlined our need to make the State&rsquo;s planning and legal processes more efficient. The Government has therefore already been working, over the last number of months, to make improvements to those processes. This will ensure that we are better placed to take advantage of future investment opportunities, whether from data centre providers or other sectors. </p>  <p>  The Government has, for example, published legislative proposals to designate data centres as "strategic infrastructure" for planning purposes. This will ensure that future data centre-related planning applications can move more swiftly through the planning process. I am hopeful that these legislative changes can be enacted by the end of the current D&aacute;il session.  </p>  <p>  The Government also agreed, in October 2017, to the implementation of a strengthened policy framework to support the continued development of data centres. This framework includes a number of actions which, once fully implemented, will help Ireland attract and sustain such investments in the future.</p>  <p>  Part of this work is the development of a National Policy Statement on the role of data centres in Ireland&rsquo;s overall enterprise strategy. This will set out their potential in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, especially in regional locations, whilst taking account of wider challenges in energy and renewable energy policy. The importance of data centres to Ireland is recognised as well in Project Ireland 2040, which makes clear that the promotion of Ireland as a sustainable international destination for information and communications technology infrastructure is a key national objective. </p>  <p>  The IDA, meanwhile, is already working hard to win new data centre investments for Ireland. Despite the disappointing decision made by Apple, Ireland is still a highly attractive destination for data centre projects. There are nearly 30 major data centres located here that are operated by some of the world&rsquo;s leading technology companies and I am confident that this number will increase in the future. Ireland&rsquo;s strengths for this type of investment, including our climate, energy supply and business environment, remain well-known to other potential investors.</p></reply>

The scheme will allow workers in the horticulture, meat processing and dairy sectors from non-EEA countries to access the labour market.</p>  <p>  As the economy improves and we approach full employment, labour shortages at the lower skills end of the jobs market are becoming apparent in some sectors, with the consequent potential to constrict growth if these needs are not met. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, in recognition of the changed economy and labour market of today as we move clearly and strongly out of the downturn, I asked my Department to review the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that our current policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they critical skills needs or lower-skilled labour shortages. The review is overseen by an Interdepartmental Group, chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  A Report is due to for my consideration by the end of June 2018.  </p>  <p>  However, I am acutely aware of the particular challenges facing parts of the agri-food sector.  The sector employs about 173,000 people across the regions, contributes almost 8% to gross national income, and currently has exports worth almost &euro;13.5bn. It is our most important indigenous sector and its reach into rural Ireland brings jobs and value to every region. For this reason, I asked the review group in advance of completing the full review, to prioritise the emerging labour shortages in the sector in its deliberations.</p>  <p>  I am applying a quota of 500 permits for horticulture workers, 250 for meat processing operatives and 50 for dairy farm assistants. This is to ensure that in the longer-term, strategies are put in place to source labour supply from both the domestic and European labour markets and to invest in innovative technologies for the sector.  A new minimum remuneration threshold of &euro;22,000 is being introduced for these occupations. Furthermore, there will be specific obligations on the employers around the welfare and prospects of the foreign nationals employed. This includes ensuring they have access to suitable accommodation and to training in areas such as language skills.</p>  <p>  This is a departure from our current employment permits regime, which has generally focused on critical skills gaps at the higher end of the labour market as we position Ireland for further growth in the knowledge economy.  Like many developed countries, however, we are now seeing pressures at the lower-skilled end of the market. In seeking to deal with these pressures, I am also conscious that any changes introduced must not disrupt the domestic labour market.</p>  <p>  Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the medium term, but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce, with an emphasis on the process of lifelong learning, and on maximizing the potential of EEA nationals to fill our skills deficits.</p>  <p>  The report of the Inter-Departmental review group, due this summer, is tasked with recommending a strategy for economic migration to meet the State's changing labour needs into the future.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs process has worked well to achieve its primary objective. Since the first Plan was launched in early 2012, there are over 345,000 more people at work. The unemployment rate has fallen from a high of 16 per cent to 5.9 per cent in April 2018. A continuing focus of the Action Plan for Jobs is that the regions benefit from employment growth so that all regions have an unemployment rate of no more than one percentage point of the national average.</p><p>The four key aims of Action Plan for Jobs 2018 are that:</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base remains successful amid the uncertainty created by Brexit;</p><p>- all parts of the country achieve their potential in terms of job creation;</p><p>- those entering, re-entering, or in the workforce have the incentives and skills needed to prosper; and</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise base remains successful by focusing relentlessly on competitiveness, productivity, and innovation.</p><p>With Action Plan for Jobs 2018, the Government demonstrates its commitment to support the long-term growth of our enterprise sector. Action Plan for Jobs 2018 reflects the Enterprise 2025 Renewed priorities and also the priorities within other Government strategies that are relevant to job creation, including for people with disabilities, e.g. Pathways to Work Strategy and the Action Plan for Education. Pathways to Work is the main Government initiative encouraging access to the labour market and ultimately participation in employment. It is complemented by the Action Plan for Jobless Households, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. </p><p>Under Action Plan for Jobs 2018, there is a focus on increasing participation in the labour market, including assisting access to work for those who wish to do so, by ensuring they have opportunity to address real or perceived skills deficiencies, whether they are discouraged workers or people with disabilities.</p><p>Specific measures in Action Plan for Jobs 2018 include implementing the Pathways to Work Strategy, increasing awareness among employers of the range of services and supports available to maximise take up, and improving information flow on welfare-to-work schemes, targeting employers and inactive people.  </p><p>There is also a specific action to increase the focus of activation efforts on groups outside the labour force, by:</p><p>- reviewing the range of income supports (including in-work supports) for people with disabilities to ensure payments are aligned between schemes and, if appropriate, amend the payment structure to ensure that it supports a return to work for people who wish to do so;</p><p>- expanding the use of Intreo Centres as a gateway to engage with people with disabilities and increase the number of Intreo staff trained in the provision of employment supports to people with disability; and</p><p>- developing online ready-reckoner tools for people on disability payments to assess the net benefits of returning to work.  <b></b></p></reply>

First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. This application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers.

That is why additional financial resources have been secured to support the strategic response to Brexit by our enterprise agencies, including IDA Ireland.</p>  <p>  Brexit, or more particularly the response to the challenges it presents, is a key factor in shaping IDA Ireland's strategy and operations. This includes the Agency's approach to regional development, finance, planning, marketing and promotional activities. The IDA has established a specific Brexit Committee to oversee its response to the opportunities and challenges arising from the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU. The Agency also has a clear Brexit Plan, which includes one-to-one investor engagements and public relations and media campaigns.  </p>  <p>  I am very much conscious of the particular trade implications that Brexit may have for border counties, such as Donegal, where 12 IDA Ireland client companies are based. These companies employ 3,389 people in the County. I am pleased that the level of employment by multinationals in the County has increased by 52% since 2012 and we are committed - notwithstanding the challenges associated with Brexit - to increasing these numbers even further. </p>  <p>  Employment growth in Donegal is not, of course, driven by overseas companies alone. Enterprise Ireland has also grown its jobs numbers in the County, with its client companies increasing employment by over 100 positions in 2017. Both Enterprise Ireland and the IDA maintain constant engagement with their clients in Donegal to encourage them to grow jobs and investments in the County even further. The Agencies also work together, wherever possible, to spur employment creation. The Local Enterprise Offices, as well as InterTrade Ireland, are also working hard to ensure sustainable job growth for County Donegal and for the wider North-West Region. </p></reply>

Ireland moved from 16th in 2015 to 6th in 2017 in the Institute for Management Development&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook. In addition, the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent &ldquo;Doing Business 2018&rdquo; report shows Ireland is now ranked 17th out of 190 countries, an improvement of one place on last year.</p>  <p>  However, there is no room for complacency. Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2017 Report, published by the National Competitiveness Council in December last year, outlines the main challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and the policy responses required to meet them. Although national in scope, many of the recommendations apply to Dublin. My officials and I remain focused on competitiveness - an agenda that requires continued cross Government commitment and a focus on the implementation of actions to enhance it. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship, innovation and investment across all regions, including Dublin. The immediate challenge for Ireland is to ensure growth is sustainable, that enterprises are resilient and we continue to grow Irish enterprises and attract foreign direct investment. We are continually examining how we can improve on factors that are crucial to fostering further investment here, including our cost base, infrastructure, the availability of talent and innovation.</p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 Renewed - which I launched recently - placed an increased emphasis on developing our Irish-owned enterprises. There is a strong focus on taking action that will embed resilience in our enterprise base. We are placing a spotlight on innovation and on skills. Enterprise Ireland places a strong emphasis on competitiveness. It supports exporting enterprises with initiatives in Lean, Research, Development and Innovation, and management development. The Agency helps enterprises to take a strategic approach to understanding and responding to potential implications arising from Brexit and assists them to enter into new markets and diversify their export base.  The Local Enterprise Offices offer a suite of supports to enhance the competitiveness of small and micro enterprises. </p>  <p>  Quality and affordability of life is particularly important in ensuring Ireland is an attractive location for talent and investment. Ireland, and particularly Dublin, relative to many EU cities, is an expensive place to live in terms of residential property costs. The Government is acutely aware that ultimately, additional housing supply is required to address house price and rent pressures. The 'Rebuilding Ireland&rsquo; Plan presents a wide-ranging set of commitments to address housing supply, and while many of these will take time, the Government is implementing and driving change. In 2017, over 17,500 new homes commenced construction. </p>  <p>  Recognising that Dublin&rsquo;s continued performance is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness, some of the key measures outlined in the National Planning Framework, such as delivering the key rail projects set out in the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area, improving access to Dublin Airport and facilitating the growth of Dublin Port, are also focused on supporting the future growth and success of Dublin as Ireland&rsquo;s leading global city of scale. </p></reply>

This strategy provides a comprehensive framework for delivering SFI&rsquo;s actions to retain and increase the participation of excellent female researchers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) careers.  Since the launch, SFI has moved towards streamlining gender initiatives across all its programmes, with the overarching aim of redressing the gender imbalance amongst SFI award holders. </p>  <p>  SFI&rsquo;s Gender Strategy sets out the agency&rsquo;s roadmap to improve the representation and progression of women in all aspects of STEM careers in Ireland:</p>  <p>  - Strand 1 of the strategy focuses on gender equality across SFI education and public engagement initiatives, with the aim of increasing the participation and interest of girls in STEM-related activities.</p>  <p>  - Strand 2 targets female representation within the SFI funded portfolio and SFI review panels. Concrete measures to achieve these targets are outlined.</p>  <p>  - Strand 3 will ensure that gender perspectives are integrated into the research content of SFI funded research programmes. </p>  <p>  In 2017, SFI achieved its Agenda 2020 target of making 25% of its awards to female researchers and this target has now been revised upward to 30%.  This target has been aided by SFI providing incentives for research bodies to submit applications from female researchers to various programmes, with a focus on those aligned with early career stage. </p>  <p>  The SFI Research Outputs Census 2017 shows that the percentage of female SFI Award Holders Active in 2017 was 28%, up on 25% in 2016 and 21% in 2015.  The percentage of female team members (those employed on SFI awards) was 37%, an increase on 35% in 2016, which represents progress towards redressing gender imbalance. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, award holders&rsquo; success rates (2016) shows that female researchers are as competitive as their male counterparts in terms of their SFI funding success rate i.e., 32% across all programmes.  However, female researchers within the same cohort (2016) accounted for only 25% of SFI funding applications received. </p>  <p>  SFI is also supportive of the Athena SWAN Charter which is the internationally recognised &lsquo;quality mark&rsquo; for gender equality.  It was established to encourage and recognise commitment to advancing the careers of women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine.  </p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland continues to implement specific grant management policies to deal with the needs of female researchers during periods of maternity and adoptive leave, and will continue to innovate in this regard. The policies being developed and associated outcomes will complement and support the Athena SWAN initiative, whereby the Irish Research Council, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health Research Board will require research bodies to have attained a bronze institutional Athena SWAN award by the end of 2019 and a silver institutional Athena SWAN by the end of 2023, to be eligible for research funding.  </p>  <p>  Another aspect of Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s Gender Strategy is to ensure that gender is integrated as a perspective in all the research Science Foundation Ireland funds, when this is relevant. While this approach was launched for some programmes during 2017, applicants will in future be required to provide a statement articulating the sex/gender variables in their research and will include guidance for applicants and a request for comment from the reviewers. </p>  <p>  Finally, further rollout of gender redressing initiatives amongst SFI award holders will include those to address gender imbalance in senior academic roles.  Specifically, in order to encourage more applications from excellent female researchers to the SFI Research Professorship Programme, SFI is mandating that for all institutions wishing to nominate candidates to the programme, one of the next two successful Expressions of Interest (i.e. approved by SFI) must be associated with a female candidate, which must then be followed up with the submission of a Full Proposal.</p>  <p>  The above detail shows that SFI is proactive in bringing about a sea change on gender equality matters in the field of research and development and I am confident that the initiatives employed by SFI to date will continue to bring further successes in the future.   </p></reply>

Membership of leading International Research Organisations is an important mechanism for facilitating this engagement.  </p>  <p>  For this reason, the Government gave a commitment in Innovation 2020 to examine Ireland's membership options with a number of International Research Organisations including CERN and also the European Southern Observatory (ESO), ELIXIR and LOFAR. </p>  <p>  Ireland joined ELIXIR, the life sciences data infrastructure organisation in 2016 and in 2017 my department funded Ireland's membership of the International LOFAR Radio Telescope.  As announced in October 2017, Ireland is expected to join ESO later in 2018.  </p>  <p>  CERN is a leading global scientific collaboration investigating the fundamental composition of matter. It was established in 1952 and currently has 21 member states and co-operation agreements with approximately 40 other states.  My Department has been assessing the case for membership of CERN.  </p>  <p>  Regrettably, in view of the intense demands on the capital programme and the tight fiscal constraints it will not be possible to progress membership of both CERN and the European Southern Observatory in 2018.  As mentioned, Ireland will join ESO later this year and a capital allocation has been obtained specifically to ensure Ireland's membership.  This will cost &euro;0.75 million in 2018 and increase to approximately &euro;3.5 million in 2019.</p>  <p>  This decision to proceed to join ESO first reflects an assessment of the costs and benefits of each membership.  ESO has been prioritised over CERN because of the large, established community of astronomy researchers in Ireland.  Astronomy is an active area of research in each of our universities and several of our institutes of technology. </p>  <p>  This community is well positioned to avail of the opportunities provided by ESO membership, thereby maximising the immediate benefit to Ireland. </p>  <p>  These opportunities include participation in pioneering frontier research, access to cutting-edge technology, commercial opportunities for enterprise, the creation of human capital and skills and the further promotion of STEM subjects in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In addition, the companies in Ireland that have had great success in securing contracts from the European Space Agency are well placed to bid for ESO contracts due to the overlap between the technologies used by ESO and ESA.  </p>  <p>  I fully recognise the value of membership of International Research Organisations (IROs) and my department has an on-going objective to increase Ireland's participation in IROs. </p>  <p>  We will keep the issue of CERN membership under review and it is my hope that we may be in a position to progress CERN membership in the future, when the fiscal situation permits.</p></reply>

These show that the value of goods exports rose by 4% in Quarter 1 this year when compared to Q1 in 2017.  The value of goods exports in Jan-March 2018 was &euro;33.521 billion compared to a value of &euro;32.141 billion in Jan-March 2017.</p>  <p>  The principal categories of goods exports in the Quarter were Medical and Pharmaceutical Productswhich increased by 18% to &euro;11 billion, Organic Chemicalswhich increased by 47% to &euro;7billion and Miscellaneous manufactured articles,  which increased by 5% to &euro;1.8 billion when compared with Q1 last year.</p>  <p>  While in March 2018 the value of goods exports to the UK fell by 5.7%, for the period Jan-March 2018 there has been a 2% increase in the value of goods exports to the UK.</p>  <p>  Overall, in 2017, total exports of goods and services reached a record level of &euro;283 billion, a 9% increase over 2016.  Services export values rose by 14%, to their highest level to date of &euro;161 billion and, for a fourth consecutive year the value of goods exports from Ireland rose to reach a new record high of &euro;122 billion.  </p>  <p>  Goods exports from Ireland globally and to the UK have risen in the first quarter of 2018.  The CSO data in itself does not reveal the impact that Brexit may have had on the level of these exports.  However, it does provide a valuable indication of trends which will continue to be monitored while the Government intensifies its efforts, domestically and internationally, to support companies with an export focus.</p>  <p>  In the 'Building Stronger Business' report, my Department set out a strategy to minimise risks of Brexit and maximise opportunities across four pillars of helping companies to compete, innovate, trade and to negotiate the best outcome for business.  It sets out the range of diagnostic, advisory and financial supports that are being made available to companies to help minimise Brexit impacts and target new opportunities. </p>  <p>  Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme for businesses and a &euro;25 million Brexit response loan scheme for the agrifood sector.  This is in addition to supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50 million in total.  The fund of &euro;116 billion announced in Project 2040 for capital investment over the next decade will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects which can accelerate economic growth and mitigate the impact of Brexit.  An Taoiseach&rsquo;s plans for our increased Global Footprint 2025 will further underpin the across-Government efforts to support our globally-trading companies, thereby sustaining jobs, ever mindful of the various challenges to further growth potential, including, of course, Brexit.</p></reply>

Technological advances have a pervasive impact across many, if not all, sectors of the economy.  In this regard, many sectors of the economy today require technology skills and expertise &ndash; demands for high-tech skills are not merely the domain of the ICT sector.  </p>  <p>   Enterprise 2025 Renewed reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be positioned to the forefront in disruptive technologies, embedding innovation and driving productivity growth.  Enterprise 2025 Renewed places a spotlight on talent &ndash; ensuring that Ireland continues to perform well internationally in terms of access to the skills required of the 21st Century. </p>  <p>  Growth in high tech related employment is buoyant and will likely continue to be so in the coming years.  This is being driven by factors such as market demand, technology shifts, the impact of cloud computing, and digital transformation of the economy. </p>  <p>  A large number of investments by IDA Ireland client companies into the country require technically proficient staff.  For example, new projects announced in 2018 &ndash; such as Jaguar Land Rover&rsquo;s planned software engineering centre in Shannon or MSD&rsquo;s planned new biotechnology facility in Dublin &ndash; will need highly skilled employees. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supported a total of 181 start ups in 2017 (90 of which are classified as High Potential Start Ups).  The medtech, fintech and agtech sectors were well represented, and the majority of start-ups have a strong technological element, data analytics or on-line presence.  </p>  <p>  Much of the demand for a variety of high tech skills is in established areas such as software development.  Enterprises are also making plans, however, to hire more expertise in new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Blockchain and Cybersecurity as digital transformation proceeds.</p>  <p>  The growth in high technology roles is underpinned by the ICT Skills Action Plan, which is jointly developed and managed by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  The third iteration of the ICT Action Plan will be published in the coming months, and will build on the success of previous plans with a range of measures aimed at maintaining the momentum in increasing the output of skilled high level ICT professionals from the education and training system, enhancing ICT capacity and awareness, ensuring Ireland maintains a strong ICT talent pool, and that Ireland is promoted as a centre for high level ICT skills.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains a favoured destination for investment that requires high-tech employment on account of our highly skilled and flexible workforce.  Our education system is also a key factor as it continues to produce the calibre of graduates that foreign and Irish owned companies seek for their high-tech facilities and investments.  Investments in place-making, as envisaged in Project Ireland 2040, to develop places that are attractive to live, work and invest in and offer a quality of life, will continue to play a key role in Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for mobile talent. </p>  <p>  I am confident, given our strengths and track record as a home to high-tech global companies, that we can expect further such investments in the future.  The Government will continue to work hard to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s offering to such firms remains highly attractive and competitive.</p></reply>

At that Special Session on 18 May Ireland supported a resolution which inter-alia provided for the establishment of an independent Commission of Inquiry into what happened and why.

The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and in April 2018 it redeemed &euro;243m of its subordinated debt. However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of repaying the State&rsquo;s contingent liability, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA. </p>  <p>  Subject to current market conditions prevailing, this includes redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s remaining subordinated debt of &euro;1.4bn by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes. It is through the successful completion of its deleveraging, Docklands and residential funding programmes that NAMA currently projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work. As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules. However, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

This objective has been included in the IFS2020 Action Plan which commits to developing amendments to the Investment Limited Partnership Act 1994 to make the structure more attractive to fund managers. </p><p>My Department sought and obtained approval from the Government for the preparation of Heads of Bill in 2017.  The Heads of Bill have been sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and a drafter has been assigned to work on this. </p><p>The Bill appears on the legislative programme for 2018 and it is anticipated that the draft legislation will be developed in the second half of the year with the intention for the Bill to be considered by the House before the end of this year. </p><p>I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that there are currently 7 Investment Limited Partnerships authorised by it and they supplied the following breakdown:<table><tr><th>YEAR </th><th>Number of ILPs Registered</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to Limited Partnerships, the relevant legislation that applies to these is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation. I have been informed by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation of the numbers of Limited Partnerships established in Ireland since 2013, and this is outlined in the following table. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number of Limited Partnerships (LPs) Registered</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>431</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>676</td></tr></table></p><p>I have also been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation that they do not have any statistics on the numbers of Limited Partnerships or Investment Limited Partnerships established in other parts of Europe.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation point out however that based on data from Companies House (UK), the number of Limited Partnerships Incorporated in the UK at end of period:<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number of Limited Partnerships (LPs) Registered</th></tr><tr><td>2012-2013</td><td>2,,769</td></tr><tr><td>2013-2014</td><td>4,026</td></tr><tr><td>2014-2015</td><td>4,545</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2016</td><td>6,544</td></tr><tr><td>2016-2017</td><td>5,650</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to other European countries, Limited Partnerships as a structure are either not available in other European countries or are not directly comparable to the structures within Ireland.  For example Germany has a partnership structure that is utilised for  investment funds but the structure differs to that within Ireland, and France has introduced a form of limited partnership in 2015. </p></reply>

However, unlike a loan sale, the bank generally continues to retain the legal title to the loan assets and to service, manage and carry out the creditor's rights and obligations under the credit agreement in relation to the borrower; likewise the debtor's obligations under the loan contract will continue to be to the bank.</p><p>In terms of consumer and other borrower protections, the legal and regulatory provisions, including the Central Bank codes and SME lending regulations, which apply to the provision and operation of mortgage or other loans to relevant borrowers will continue to apply irrespective of the status of the creditor. In particular, the provisions of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 ensure that consumers, whose loans are sold to an entity which is not regulated by the Central Bank, will maintain the same Central Bank regulatory protections they had prior to the sale.  Furthermore, the options and frameworks available to insolvent borrowers under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 as amended will also apply irrespective of the status of the creditor party to a loan contract. </p></reply>

These build on actions on digital skills set out in the National Skills Strategy 2025.</p>  <p>  In 2015, my Department published the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 which includes a range of relevant actions that will support the development of digital skills both directly through specific curriculum content and through technology enhanced learning across the curriculum. </p>  <p>  Within the Higher Education sector, a number of actions are included to implement the Roadmap for Enhancement in a Digital World 2015-2017 aimed at supporting the development and embedding of digital capacity in teaching and learning activities and developing consistent digital experiences for learners.</p>  <p>  There are considerable changes occurring within the Further Education Sector (FET) to improve the existing capacity in the area of digital inclusion and the provision of digital skills in FET.  The Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) in Further Education and Training 2016 &ndash; 2019 Strategy will build on existing capacity and good practice in TEL to expand access to and continuously improve and innovate FET provision.  </p>  <p>  A range of programmes are provided within ETBs for individuals who wish to develop their digital literacy.  Basic ICT tuition is integrated within adult literacy and numeracy provision.  Opportunities for basic skills provision is offered through a variety of providers via a broad range of ETB FET provision delivered in adult education centres, community education settings and training centres.  Delivery of these programmes is designed to meet the needs of participants'  personal and career goals and are offered on a full and part-time basis.  These courses are supported through the funding provided to the Adult Literacy Programme, Bridging and Foundation Training, Local Training Initiatives, Community Education, Youthreach and the BTEI (Back to Education Initiative).  Some of these programmes combine transversal skills such as literacy, numeracy, digital skills, communications and teamworking with specific occupational skills. </p>  <p>  In 2017 a total of 58,103 beneficiaries availed of FET programmes within the ICT skills cluster.

Details surrounding the consultation process have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>(www.education.ie). </i></p><p>As I indicated in the house this week, if there is a particular group that needs to make a submission, and it believes it will not be able to do so by 25th May, I will make sure that the submission is accommodated.  I am pleased that we have already received a significant number of submissions from special schools.</p></reply>

Each claim is considered separately having regard to the particular facts of the case.</p>  <p>  The general policy of the State Claims Agency, in relation to such claims, is that where the Garda&iacute; cause damage to property in conducting a search, any claim from the property owner in respect of that damage is contested unless there&rsquo;s demonstrable negligence on the part of the Garda authorities.  Other relevant factors taken into account include whether the Garda&iacute; were acting on foot of a search warrant or whether they had other lawful authority to carry out a forced entry to a premises. Search warrants authorise the Garda&iacute; to use force to gain entry to a property if necessary and the Garda&iacute; have no legal liability to the property owner for the damage caused in forcing entry to the property in those circumstances. The approach taken by the State Claims Agency in contesting these claims has been upheld by the Courts in a number of claims brought to Court by property owners.</p>  <p>  It is not my function to offer legal advice to the individual referred to in the Deputy's question but it is clearly open to that person to seek their own legal advice on the options open to them.</p></reply>

Vetting is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016. </p>  <p>  Vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, data protection law requires that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.</p>  <p>  The National Vetting Bureau has deployed an e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The e-vetting system is available to all registered organisations and I am informed that the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-vetting system to do so. Notwithstanding a recent increase in the volume of applications submitted to the Bureau, processing times are generally in the order of a 5-6 working day turnaround for 80% of applications received.  In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to know that there are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant and the organisations in question in accordance with section 12 of the Acts.</p></reply>

By virtue of section 4(1) of the Act, section 18(h)  applies to an enactment (including a rule of court) except in so far as the contrary intention appears in this Act, in the enactment itself (in this instance, the rule of court concerned) or, where relevant, in the Act under which the enactment is made. The effect of section 4(1) is that if a contrary intention appears in another enactment when considering whether a provision of the Act applies, the Act provision will not apply.</p></reply>

It was considered an operational matter as it related to an incident that occurred in the Dochas Centre.  It was not envisaged that the report would be furnished to any party to the enquiry.</p>  <p>  As had been outlined in the answers to previous Parliamentary Questions relating to this matter, a review of the report by the Director General of the IPS highlighted some legal and procedural flaws in the way in which the enquiry was conducted. This included the fact that there was an absence of documentary evidence to show that all of those who had participated in the enquiry were given an opportunity to comment on the accuracy of the comments attributed to them by the investigators. In addition, where third parties were named, such individuals were not given an opportunity to respond.</p>  <p>  In order to address those issues a second external investigator was appointed to review the original report and try to bring the enquiry to a satisfactory conclusion. Regretfully, for reasons outlined in the answer to parliamentary question 6552/18, it was not possible to do so.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the IPS that, notwithstanding the legal and procedural flaws which were highlighted in the original report, the recommendations were reviewed on their own merits to see if they could benefit the operation of the Prison Service. Some of these recommendations were incorporated into Circular OPS 12/2011 'Consolidated Guidelines for Prisoners Released on Temporary Release' which was supported by the 'Consolidated Temporary Release Guidelines' which issued in 2012. The recommendations which were incorporated were that prisoners should have the terms and conditions of their temporary release explained to them, that the prisoner must acknowledge the conditions of the temporary release and sign the Temporary Release form, the prisoner must consent to being granted a period of temporary release and that a written record of the decision must be placed on the Prisoner Information and Management System.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that the total costs associated with the commission of the investigation report was &euro;32,140.60 and &euro;900 for the review.  This amount included payments which related to travel and associated expenses.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Cavan/Monaghan Division on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 344. There are also 11 Garda Reserves and 38 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cavan/Monaghan Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and cross-border crime. The Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 53 to the Cavan/Monaghan Division, 13 of whom were allocated from the most recent attestation of new Garda&iacute; in March. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p>  <p>   This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its legacy is still having an impact. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division.</p>  <p>  The investment in personnel I have outlined is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015. </p>  <p>  In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period.</p>  <p>  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Cavan/Monaghan, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available. </p></reply>

That Act provides that victims of crime can receive information from the relevant criminal justice agency at all stages of criminal proceedings up to and including the offender's release from custody. </p><p>Upon their release from custody sex offenders are required to register with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a set period up to life, depending on the sentence that they received at trial. The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a provision at section 10 that allows a registered sex offender to apply to the courts to have their name removed from the Register once a period of at least ten years has elapsed since their release. Prior to any such application they must first inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their intention to do so.</p><p>I will shortly bring to Government a General Scheme of a Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill. The Bill will update the law as it relates to sexual offenders following a comprehensive review of current legislative and administrative provisions. Among the provisions proposed in the Scheme are:</p><p>- Changes to the notification requirements for sex offenders;</p><p>- Risk assessment of convicted persons;</p><p>- Disclosure of information by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, relating to persons on the sex offender register, in extenuating circumstances;</p><p>- Electronic monitoring of sex offenders;</p><p>- Amendment and variation of a sex offender order (including the addition of electronic monitoring to an order); and</p><p>- Provisions whereby a court can prohibit a sex offender from working with children.</p><p>The Oireachtas will, of course, have the opportunity to consider this Bill once it is published. I am happy to consider further proposals regarding this issue.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Ballymun Garda Station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the DMR North Division was 678, of whom 120 were assigned to Ballymun Garda Station including 12 sergeants. There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 40 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. More than 120 extra Garda were assigned to the specialist units within Special Crime Operations since 2017. In addition, a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the DMR was established at the end of 2016 in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that a number of measures have been put in place to address the difficulties experienced in Ballymun. These measures include additional high-visibility patrols, support from the regional public order unit and operations by the local drug unit and will continue into the future.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide of whom 140 have been assigned to the DMR North Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR North Division.</p>  <p>  Appointments to the ranks of sergeant are a matter for the Commissioner under section 14 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that the overall strength of the sergeant rank was 1,852 as of 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are available. I am further advised by the Commissioner that there is a competition in train for promotion to the rank of sergeant with the aim of bringing the strength to 2,000, as agreed under the Employment Control Framework. I am assured by the Commissioner that following completion of these competitions the needs of all Garda Divisions including the DMR North Division will be fully considered when determining the allocation of Sergeants. </p></reply>

Community Policing initiatives and building trust with communities are integral to successfully tackling this issue. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those within society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities that they serve. The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for all agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard.<b></b></p><p>The Deputy may be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Family Support Network (NFSN) developed &quot;the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme&quot; to respond to the needs of drug users and family members experiencing drug related intimidation.  One of the actions being taken forward in 2018 under &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - A health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017 - 2025&quot;, relates to strengthening the effectiveness of the Reporting Programme. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the NFSN will each carry out their own evaluation of the Reporting Programme with a view to informing its further development.</p><p>There is growing evidence, both internationally and in Ireland, that partnership approaches involving local communities, state agencies and other stakeholders offer the mosteffective method of responding to many drug problems, including illicit drug markets. Any proposals for more innovative approaches to the problem, whether adopted from international experience or building on the current approach under Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, and which offer further value in tackling the problem as it occurs in this jurisdiction will be given due consideration. </p><p>Under the Reporting Programme, a Garda Inspector has been selected in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug related intimidation.  These Inspectors are at management level within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and liaise directly with their local Superintendent in relation to each individual case.  Persons seeking the assistance of the Inspector in their area may contact them to arrange to meet either formally or informally.  It is also possible for a person to ask a local family support worker or drugs worker to contact the Garda Inspector for their area or to ask the National Family Support Network to contact the relevant Inspector. The contact details for the nominated Garda Inspectors are available on the Garda website.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently delivering seminars and briefings to local Garda management on the Reporting Programme and gathering feedback as to its performance.</p><p>In dealing with any reports of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do so with the utmost regard to the safety of the person making a report and the most effective means available to afford persons subject to a threat, the best level of security, advice and support that can be offered.  Most importantly, all reports are handled with the utmost regard to confidentiality. </p><p>At the heart of the concerns expressed by the Deputy, is the relationship between communities and their local Garda&iacute;. It is worth recalling that the Programme for a Partnership Government underlines the importance of community policing in responding to the concerns and expectations of both urban and rural communities. I would like to re-affirm that the Government remains committed to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make communities safer.  The Government has allocated very significant resources to policing in recent years, and this will continue, in particular through the accelerated programme of Garda recruitment. This undoubtedly will enhance policing services for all communities across the country. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in a variety of activities, including Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, Garda Youth Diversion Projects which support the operation of the statutory Diversion Programme, the Garda Schools Programme and proactive operations designed to address drug supply in communities.  I would also like to emphasise in particular, that where communities experience intimidation, Joint Policing Committees have a very important role in facilitating consultation, cooperation and synergy on policing and crime issues between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Local Authorities and elected local representatives.  Active engagement by elected members is very important.</p></reply>

This fund supports companies in sectors with rapid design cycles to maintain their technology position.  The benefits of this grant are that it allows for a very simple application process and delivers a very fast response from application to approval. This fund allows companies to access up to 50% in support for product, process or service development projects up to a total cost of &euro;300,000.</p>  <p>  The Agile Innovation Fund has recently opened for applications for funding, which are currently being processed. To date nine companies have been approved funding under this initiative, although no payments have been made as yet.  It is envisaged that grant approvals under this initiative will come online over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

One of the new supports that Enterprise Ireland has introduced to encourage companies to enter new markets is the Market Discovery Fund. </p><p>Launched in January 2018, the Market Discovery Fund aims to encourage companies to expand into new markets by helping with the costs of researching viable and sustainable market entry strategies. </p><p>The Fund provides support towards both internal and external costs incurred by companies when researching new markets for products and services. Eligible companies can receive support when they are looking at a new geographic market for an existing product/service, or when looking at exporting a new product/service to a market that they already do business in.</p><p>The Market Discovery Fund is available across three levels: </p><p>- Level 1: Grant up to &euro;35K </p><p>- Level 2: Grant greater than &euro;35K but less than &euro;75K </p><p>- Level 3: Grant greater than &euro;75K but less than &euro;150K</p><p>The maximum funding is 50% of eligible expenditure up to a maximum grant of &euro;150,000. Eligible expenditure includes, but is not limited to, salary support, consultancy costs, trade fair costs and foreign travel. </p><p>The Market Discovery Fund was launched in 2018, and has only been open for applications for a number of weeks. It is not possible, therefore, to provide data prior to this year.  To date, fifteen Market Discovery Grants have been approved. As the fund is at such a nascent stage it is not yet possible to report on the geographic spread or take-up among different sized companies.</p></reply>

This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.</p>  <p>  Through the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, we aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  Specifically, in relation to Brexit, there is a clear priority to intensify and diversify the export base with a target of 80% of indigenous export growth to 2020 to be outside of the UK market and maintain exports of at least &euro;7.5 billion to the UK. More recently, Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020. The strategy also targets a 50 percent increase in the number of FDI investments from non-US markets by 2020.   </p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets. In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and published by Enterprise Ireland, with 70 Ministerial-led trade visits planned to 33 different markets.  Several events have already taken place, including ministerial-led missions to the USA in January, and Mexico and Russia in February.  Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.  As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world were organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests. The Government has signalled its ambition to further enhance its overseas networks through the Global Footprint 2025 initiative, which aims to double the impact of our overseas presence through an increase in our enterprise agency global footprint and Embassy network. </p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  Irish companies may now take advantage of the all-important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.</p>  <p>  On the 21st April 2018, the EU and Mexico reached an agreement in principle on a new trade agreement that will be part of the broader Global Agreement.  The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, the current total value is just over &euro;2 billion per year with total imports of nearly half a billion euros per year.  It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.  This will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and poultry products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.  There are many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including manufacturing, automotive, engineering, telecommunications, ICT, aerospace, software and service and manufacturing technology.  The Agreement will also open up public procurement markets to Irish businesses and remove technical barriers to trade which will reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market.</p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.  The agri-food sector, in particular will see benefits from access to Japan&rsquo;s highly valuable export market, with improved access for beef, pork, cheese and processed agricultural products.  In addition the EU&rsquo;s trade deal with Singapore is hoped to come into force by the end of the year.  </p>  <p>  During his September 2017 State of the Union address, the President of the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed opening trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.  This month, the Trade Council of Ministers adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, as well as adoption of the respective negotiating directives for the Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new FTA&rsquo;s giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  My Department has recently commissioned a study to examine the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from FTAs, both currently in place and in negotiation. The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.</p></reply>

Innovation is at the centre of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017 &ndash; 2020 and is critical for companies seeking to diversify their global footprint, both within and outside of the EU market.</p><p>Innovation is essential for all companies, irrespective of their stage of development.  It enables companies to improve their competitiveness both at home and internationally, to develop tailored products and services for global customers and to win market share.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland is working with its clients to drive innovation activity via a number of supports that enable companies to: </p><p>- Diagnose their innovation readiness; </p><p>- Finance in-house R and D projects; </p><p>- Finance collaboration with research expertise within the Higher Education Sector and with companies; and </p><p>- Maximise the funding they can receive from the European Union.</p><p>To support these activities, in 2017 Enterprise Ireland: </p><p>- Approved 99 R and D projects to clients over &euro;100,000; </p><p>- Approved funding for 436 industry innovation projects at Technology Gateways throughout the country; and </p><p>- Provided financial support for 1,065 collaborative innovations between industry and higher education institutes across the country.</p><p>Innovation is a key attribute required to be resilient to economic shocks, such as Brexit.</p><p>To drive the building of resilience to such shocks, Enterprise Ireland has put an increased emphasis on market diversification - driving innovation and competitiveness, which are key areas for companies with global ambition.  In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, and a Global Ambition campaign featuring the importance of innovation was launched. Enterprise Ireland has also recently launched a new fast-track Agile Innovation Fund which gives companies rapid access to innovation funding to enhance processes and adapt products for new markets.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with companies with global ambition, both within and outside the EU to communicate the importance of innovation, ensure that companies are aware of the available RDI supports and that available supports are streamlined and meeting the needs of companies. Among the core objectives of Enterprise Ireland is to help companies increase sales and exports.  In 2016 exports by Enterprise Ireland clients had a total value of &euro;21.6 billion, up 6% on 2015 levels.  In terms of research and innovation, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s key measure of success is investment by companies in R and D. Enterprise Ireland Clients invested &euro;916 million in R and D in 2016 and EI&rsquo;s goal is to raise this to &euro;1.25 billion per annum by 2020.</p></reply>

It is designed to facilitate business growth as the consultants can act as coach, mentor, facilitator, analyst, negotiator and/or operator for the company.  Up to 50% of the costs incurred in hiring a consultant are available up to a maximum grant amount of &euro;35,000.</p>  <p>  The Market Discovery Fund provides support to companies to assist them in researching the viability of exporting an existing product/service into a new geographic market, or introducing a new product/service into an existing market. The maximum funding is 50% of eligible expenditure up to a maximum grant of &euro;150,000.</p>  <p>  The Agile Innovation Fund is an RD and I grant aimed at clients in sectors with rapid design cycles. It has been developed to support product, service and process innovation to enhance the competitive advantage of Irish companies. The application process is simple and quick, with a short timeframe between application and approval.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work with companies to help them to become more innovative. It has rolled out a number of Brexit Advisory Clinics across the country which helps companies to examine their exposure to Brexit and develop effective strategies to mitigate against that exposure. These Clinics are open to both EI clients and non-clients and are delivered free of charge. The next Clinic will take place in Dublin on June 21st at the Aviva Stadium. Topics to be covered include Financial and Currency Management, Strategic Sourcing and Customs, Transport and Logistics, Intellectual Property, Movement of People and Markets.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has also introduced the Brexit: Act On initiative.  Under the initiative an independent consultant will come to a company for two half day sessions.  The consultant helps companies to decide on specific actions that they can implement over a short period to enable them to address the risks and avail of the opportunities caused by Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are organising workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit and have a range of supports to help clients to respond to those challenges, to become more competitive and to source new markets. </p>  <p>  Given its experience in promoting and strengthening North-South trade, InterTrade Ireland (ITI), is especially well-positioned to assist businesses in Ireland address the particular commercial challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce. That is why my Department has provided additional funding to ITI both last year and also this year, to allow it to undertake a range of initiatives aimed at better preparing Irish SMEs for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This work includes the provision of factual advice, information materials and supports for capability building and the provision of other specialist expertise for companies. Major flagship awareness events were held last year in both Belfast and Dublin, attracting several hundred companies each. In addition, an extensive series of information events have been held in smaller centres on both sides of the border. Such events have been organised by ITI in Lisburn. Mullingar, Duleek and Cootehill, and this month alone there have been events in Cork and Sligo. </p>  <p>  A key part of InterTrade Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit work is the provision for SMEs of a Brexit &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues.  These are worth &euro;2,000 to each to the companies. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is funding a research project being undertaken for InterTrade Ireland by the ESRI. The first phase of this research was aimed at improving our understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit. The second phase focused on the patterns of cross-border trade on the island of Ireland, and on the role of supply chain links. The next phase of ITI&rsquo;s research will consist of two further topics being worked on simultaneously: Cross-border trade in service and the capacity of businesses to absorb the costs of Brexit.</p></reply>

The unemployment rate has reduced from a high of almost 16 percent to 5.9 percent in April 2018. Our total exports are at an all time high. The performance of our indigenous exports remains robust and on target to achieve &euro;26 billion by 2020 with increased diversification across markets. Nevertheless, we cannot assume that past performance will continue - particularly as we face a changed environment in the aftermath of Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department recently published Enterprise 2025 Renewed. This involved reviewing our enterprise policies to ensure that our policy priorities remain robust  in today's uncertain environment. Enterprise 2025 Renewed reaffirms our policy focus on export-led growth, underpinned by innovation, talent and investments in place-making.  </p>  <p>  In the face of global challenges,  Enterprise 2025 Renewed places a greater emphasis on five main areas: </p>  <p>  - supporting the development of Irish owned enterprises so that they are a driver of growth over the period to 2025;  </p>  <p>  - placing a spotlight on innovation, skills and on leveraging Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in technologies - the fundamentals that underpin competitiveness and enhanced productivity;</p>  <p>  - stimulating greater levels of clustering that takes advantage of the distinctive enterprise mix we have here in Ireland including foreign and Irish owned and optimises spillovers; </p>  <p>  - developing Ireland&rsquo;s relationships with new like-minded members within the EU, managing our reputation in the US in particular, as well as more widely; and raising Ireland&rsquo;s visibility in overseas markets where we are less well known; and </p>  <p>  - realising the potential of all of our regions.</p>  <p>  While we cannot predict the impact of Brexit with any certainty, my Department and enterprise development agencies are focused on deepening the resilience of the enterprise base. We are building from a position of strength, notwithstanding the fact that there may be some vulnerabilities in our enterprise base.</p>  <p>  I am ensuring that my Department and its agencies continue to work relentlessly with enterprises, to strengthen sectoral and firm level resilience as a sound basis for future growth. Building Stronger Business &ndash; responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading, published in November 2017, sets out work underway and planned, in response to Brexit, including supports available to companies to help them prepare for Brexit. Furthermore, the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 sets out actions aimed at solidifying progress made since the APJ was originally published in 2012, and at deepening resilience. A key focus in Action Plan for Jobs 2018 is to support businesses in accessing the finance needed to grow their businesses and address the challenges caused by Brexit. </p>  <p>  I am confident that we have a strong basis from which to grow. While we cannot influence what happens externally, we can ensure that Ireland's future prospects are strengthened by taking the right actions now across Government to ensure that:  Ireland remains internationally competitive; that our enterprises deepen resilience through investments in skills and innovation; and that we continue to create an environment that is supportive of business investment and growth.</p></reply>

In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, and a Global Ambition campaign launched, for example:</p>  <p>  Market Diversification: Enterprise Ireland is actively working with companies with global ambition to internationalise, and in doing so, diversify their global footprint. This is critical for long term business growth. To support this, Enterprise Ireland recently launched a new Market Discovery Fund to incentivise companies to research viable and sustainable market entry strategies in new geographic markets. The agency is also increasing its trade mission programme in 2018. </p>  <p>  Innovation is essential for companies to be competitive internationally and to win market share. Enterprise Ireland is working with its clients to drive innovation activity via a number of supports that enable companies to: </p>  <p>  - Diagnose their innovation readiness; </p>  <p>  - Finance in-house R&amp;D projects; and </p>  <p>  - Finance collaboration with research expertise within the Higher Education Sector and with companies.</p>  <p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland recently launched a new fast-track Agile Innovation Fund which gives companies rapid access to innovation funding to enhance processes and adapt products for new markets.</p>  <p>  Competitiveness is critical for companies to scale and internationalise. Enterprise Ireland is working with companies to identify their competitiveness challenges and to support companies by providing access to a range of competitiveness building tools, including the Company Competitiveness Health Check, the Lean Offer and Green Offer.  Later in 2018, Enterprise will be announcing a new enhanced offering in this space.</p></reply>

Our Irish owned enterprises compete on the international stage and face unprecedented challenges as they face the implications of Brexit and need to diversify to other export markets. In this context it is crucially important that we, as a Government, continue to focus on improving Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness and attractiveness as a location in which to do business &ndash; both for foreign and Irish owned enterprises. </p>  <p>  Ireland has many strengths when it comes to attracting business investment, including our membership of the EU and the fact that we are an English-speaking nation.  For all enterprises, access to a highly skilled workforce, our supportive regulatory environment and an eco-system that stimulates and supports innovation are critical elements of an attractive location; as is access to world class infrastructures and services. Enterprise 2025 Renewed places a strong emphasis on driving export-led growth, underpinned by innovation, talent and placemaking. As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship, innovation and investment across all regions. </p>  <p>  In today&rsquo;s ever changing global environment, we cannot afford to be complacent. We need to anticipate and respond to circumstances that may impact negatively on our competitiveness or on how we may be perceived internationally. In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query, it is important first of all to note that Ireland has a robust set of laws and regulations which govern planning and environmental considerations, encourages consultation and allows for appeal.  A planning system that balances the ambitions of development against the valid interests and concerns of local populations is an appropriate and necessary structure which we should maintain and be confident in. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement in relation to streamlining the planning service - particularly in regard to the speed at which planning decisions are taken.  </p>  <p>  The Government is currently considering a package of measures to streamline the judicial review of strategic infrastructure projects in order to provide greater certainty on the timeframe for decisions on planning and other consent processes. The measures will build on the accelerated, one-stage planning process for strategic infrastructure projects which is already operated by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. </p>  <p>  Providing certainty to potential investors as to the timeframe within which they can expect a decision should ensure that Ireland's planning system remains a key part of our overall attractiveness as a good place in which to do business.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Project Ireland 2040 and the development of the associated Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, should provide a more coherent and joined-up policy context for planning decisions.  This should better facilitate both developers and planning authorities to make consistent and appropriate planning decisions which are aligned with our national and regional policy objectives.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p><p>Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p><p>From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at <i>www.hse.ie/yourmedicines. </i></p><p>The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursment of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician. The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.</p><p>The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

This is known as the three year cap.  This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and  businesses except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met. </p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.

This Plan was developed in line with the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR (2015). The iNAP activities are prioritised and being implemented across the duration of the Plan.</p>  <p>  In response to the emergence of virulent antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, in particular CPE or CRE, commonly known as 'superbugs', I convened the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in October 2017, as a public health response to the CPE superbug. CPE has been declared as a public health emergency. The NPHET is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer. It held its first meeting on 02 November 2017 and continues to meet regularly.  </p>  <p>  The actions arising from iNAP and identified through the NPHET on CPE are being progressed. The Department held back dedicated funding for 2018 and the HSE is prioritising work programmes for this funding in line with CPE risk, which also addresses strategic interventions in iNAP. To date the Department has provided funding to expand the national team on HCAI/AMR, and fund prioritised laboratory posts. This provides a multi-disciplinary team and dedicated implementation leads to tackle the challenge of AMR and CPE in particular across the HSE.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanism by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee this review which is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The NTPF have responsibility for the development of this report, although Department officials continue to engage with the NTPF regarding the review. The most recent update from the NTPF is that the report will be finalised by mid 2018.</p>  <p>  In relation to variations in the cost of care for public and private nursing homes it is acknowledged that public nursing homes have, in general, a higher cost of care.  It is understood that a number of factors contribute to this such as higher dependency levels of clients requiring a higher staff skill mix, environmental implications for staffing levels and the geographical provision of residential placements.</p>  <p>  That said, there is a need to undertake a deeper analysis of the factors driving the higher costs of care in public units. This is why the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme identified the need for a Value for Money and Policy (VFM) review of the cost differentials in public and private/voluntary residential facilities. My Department will be working on this VFM throughout the year.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at www.hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE and you will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.</p>  <p>  Ireland operates a managed employment permits system which maximises the benefits of economic migration while minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market. It operates a list system for in-demand occupations (the highly skilled list) and those for whom a ready source of labour is available (the ineligible list).</p>  <p>  Care workers are currently included on the ineligible list of employments.  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of evidence which involves research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and the National Skills Council in tandem with an extensive public consultation process with Government Departments, agencies, industry and social partners invited to provide observations.</p>  <p>  Retention issues in the State&rsquo;s labour market should not be addressed through the deployment of the employment permits system.  There would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages and not to other factors such as salary and/or working conditions.  Organisations such as Nursing Home Ireland would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed business case for removal of care workers from the ineligible list would then need to be put forward by my Department to DBEI.</p>  <p>  While I have had various meetings with Nursing Homes Ireland and this matter has been discussed, to date such detailed evidence has not been provided by the sector to my Department.  It should be noted that the overall policy is that recruitment of workers from non-EEA countries should be a last resort and all other avenues should be first exhausted. However, I am very willing to work with the industry on this important issue to ensure continuity of service in the best interests of residents.</p></reply>

Arising out of the review, a  recommendation was made to examine the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme. The Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.</p>  <p>  At present, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.  This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses except in cases of sudden illness or disability where specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to amend the scheme to treat farm and business assets in the same manner as the principal private residence where a family successor commits to working the farm or business, i.e. to cap contributions at three years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has been examining the potential for changes to the treatment of business and farm assets under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Any changes to the scheme, if approved by Government, will require amendment of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. </p>  <p>   A Memorandum for Government setting out the details of the proposed policy change and seeking Government approval to draft the General Scheme of a bill to amend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 has been prepared and will shortly be circulated to other Government Departments for observations.</p></reply>

This unit&rsquo;s staffing complement has increased in line with my action plan on market access.  It comprises a team of seven people led by an Assistant Principal Officer. The annual cost for staffing this unit, including salary, PRSI, pension and accommodation, is estimated at approximately &euro;500,000.  </p>  <p>  The meat market access unit works on expanding market access for beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry and cooked meats across a range of markets, and is also working to simplify certification procedures in a number of markets to which Ireland already has access. The work of the unit supports a meat industry with exports of around &euro;3.8 billion in 2017.  </p>  <p>  My Department has made significant progress in recent years in increasing market access opportunities for Irish meat exports.</p></reply>

The fees do not fund litter clean up and litter bin collection.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the National Litter Pollution Monitoring System report identified packaging litter as constituting 13.28% of all litter nationally.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are responsible for keeping public places that are under their control, including public roads, clear of litter as far as is practicably possible. This includes arranging cleansing programmes, as well as providing and emptying litter bins.</p>  <p>  The Litter Pollution Act 1997 provides the statutory framework to combat litter pollution. Under the Act, the primary management and enforcement responsibility rests with Local Authorities, who have a wide range of powers to tackle litter effectively, including &ldquo;on-the-spot&rdquo; fines of up to &euro;150 or, on summary conviction, fines up to &euro;4,000, for those who litter.</p>  <p>  While rigorous Local Authority enforcement is a part of the solution to littering, I believe that the key to success in tackling litter issues is through awareness raising and education. Education for young people, in particular, through the litter module of the Green Schools Programme which my Department supports each year, is very important.  Since 1997, my Department has allocated in excess &euro;15.4 million to Local Authorities under the Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme (ALAGS).  Under this Scheme, Local Authorities are responsible for selecting suitable anti-litter awareness projects for funding and deciding on the grant allocations in individual cases. In 2017, I increased funding for this scheme by 28% to &euro;885,000 and I will be maintaining this level of funding for 2018.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that consecutive annual National Litter Pollution Monitoring Surveys (see www.litter.ie) have shown that the litter situation is generally improving across the country in recent years.</p></reply>

This includes arranging cleansing programmes, as well as providing and emptying litter bins. Each local authority must prepare a litter management plan for its area, setting out its objectives to prevent and control litter, along with measures to encourage public awareness of litter. The plan must also set out measures and arrangements by which the local authority intends to achieve these objectives. In preparing its litter management plan, the authority must consult with local community and voluntary interests.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-Waste) Regulations 2015 are designed to promote the segregation and recovery of household food waste. The Regulations impose obligations on both householders and waste collectors. Under articles 4 and 5 of the Regulations, household waste collectors are required to provide, or arrange for the provision of, a separate collection service for organic waste from households in communities greater than 500 persons. Householders are obliged to segregate their food waste and make it available for separate collection. Compostable packaging, including coffee cups can also be disposed of through a food waste collection service and recycled into quality compost. </p>  <p>  An organic waste collection service is now being provided in every county across all local authority areas. Ireland has an established nationwide collection and organic recycling infrastructure with the capacity to collect, transport and recycle compostable material. It should be noted that only products which are independently certified to I.S. EN 13432 are deemed compostable and suitable for processing in Irish composting plants.</p></reply>

I assured him Ireland fully embraced the ambitions of the new strategy. I asked the Commission to focus, in particular, on the most difficult non-recyclable plastics such as soft wrapping, film and single use items.</p><p>In addition, Ireland has supported the adoption of a set of ambitious measures to make EU waste legislation fit for the future, as part of the EU's wider circular economy policy. The new recycling and landfilling targets set a credible and ambitious path for better waste management in Europe. The new EU Circular Economy Legislative Package, which was published this week, () includes a new recycling rate of 55% for plastic packaging waste by 2035, which will help drive real progress towards the circular economy, and an ability for Producer Responsibility schemes to modulate costs for individual products or groups of similar products, by taking into account their durability, reparability, re-usability and recyclability and the presence of hazardous substances.</p><p>The statistic referred to in the question is based on our national packaging waste return, which we are obliged to provide by 30 June every year to the European Commission. While I am not disputing the figure quoted, I am aware that the manner in which these statistics are reported differs from Member State to Member State. The recent EPA research call includes a study to examine how we compile our packing waste statistics compared to other Member States. The waste characterisation study which is used as part of the return is from 2008. The new waste characterisation study taking place at the moment with funding from my Department will show the current picture of what materials are disposed of in bins in Ireland.  This report, when completed, will affect future EU reports around packaging waste returns.</p><p>In relation to incentivising packaging producers to reduce the amount of plastic, our national producer responsibility scheme (Repak) is tasked with managing packaging in Ireland.  It works with its members (including all the major retailers) to identify ways to reduce or optimise packaging.  Repak charges fees to its members in accordance with the amount and type of packaging they place on the Irish market. These fees are used to subsidise the collection and recovery of waste packaging through registered recovery operators across Ireland.</p><p>Because Repak members pay fees based on the amount of packaging they place on the market, this incentivises them to reduce packaging where possible and in so doing to reduce their fees. To assist members to optimise their packaging, Repak employ packaging technologists who work with their member companies. The technologists look for ways to optimise the packaging used and to minimise any resulting packaging waste. Repak&rsquo;s Prevent and Save initiative has worked with Irish business to reduce packaging and to promote packaging improvements across industry. Further information can be found on www.repak.ie/preventandsave.</p></reply>

These policies, which were published in 2014, were developed by two working groups, which included <i>inter alia </i>representatives from the main trout and pike angling federations. </p><p>One of the most important issues considered in the previous policies relates to the management of pike in wild brown trout fisheries. In late 2016, a Review Group was established to specifically consider this issue. The Group, having met for information gathering meetings, at which a number of expert scientists made presentations, reviewed and assimilated the data and information provided. The Group reconvened in September 2017.</p><p>The presentations delivered to the Group, along with minutes of the meetings and the public consultation submissions are publicly available (). Public consultation, a broad representative forum and transparency in the Review Group&rsquo;s deliberations have been a central part of the Group&rsquo;s progression. IFI, as a public authority, recognises the diverse opinions of stakeholders and is obliged to consider all viewpoints on this issue.</p><p>In the meantime, I have given notice of proposals to make a Designated Salmonid Waters Bye-Law and instigated a public consultation where observations on the draft proposals may be expressed at any time during the period of 21 days concluding at 5pm on 25 May, 2018.</p><p>The proposed (draft) Bye-Law is intended to afford additional protection to wild brown trout confined to seven distinctive State&ndash;owned waters where established stock control measures are already in place as a matter of existing policy.  These seven limestone lakes are fairly unique in terms of topography and trout habitat and have long been managed as wild brown trout fisheries via established stock management programmes.  </p><p>The proposed Bye-Law would give statutory status to the policy designation of this small number of distinctive waters and would mean that the waters concerned would continue to be managed primarily as brown trout waters. These waters represent a very small percentage of available angling waters. </p><p>It is understood that any broader designation of waters and any required management measures will require primary legislation.</p><p>Before it can be finalised, the contents of the proposed Bye-Law and its potential scope will also require legal consultation and settlement. In view of the public consultation, it is not appropriate to comment further at this stage.</p></reply>

Currently, housing bodies are granted approved status by me as Minister, under Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 for the purpose of being able to receive funding from local authorities, to provide social housing.  An AHB seeking to obtain, and to retain, approved status in its memorandum or articles of association must:</p>  <p>  - Have as primary objectives the relief of housing needs, or poverty or hardship or the welfare of travellers, and the provision and management of housing;</p>  <p>  - Have provisions prohibiting the distribution of any surplus, profit, bonus or dividend to members and requiring the assets of the body be applied solely towards its objectives;</p>  <p>  - Have a winding-up clause which states that, in the event of winding up or dissolution of the company, there remains any property whatsoever, it shall be given or transferred to some other institution having objectives similar to the objectives of the company.</p>  <p>  This arrangement has been in place since 1992 and the Government acknowledges that a more modern regulatory system needs to be put in place to oversee a sector which has developed significantly since then. My Department is currently working on new legislation which will establish a Statutory Regulator to oversee, more effectively, the governance, financial management and performance of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies that provide housing in accordance with the Housing Acts.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the Government established an Interim Regulation Committee for the AHB sector under the auspices of the Housing Agency, which, supported by a Regulation Office based within the Agency, oversees implementation of a voluntary regulation code (VRC) for AHBs.  Since the Code was put in place, any AHB applying for housing funding from my Department and local authorities must furnish proof of compliance with the Voluntary Code.  Only those AHBs that have undergone a satisfactory assessment as part of the annual assessment process by the Regulation Office are considered eligible for funding local authorities for the provision of social housing.</p>  <p>  There are a number of schemes under which AHBs can seek to access funding through borrowing from local authorities for the provision of housing. In addition to the oversight regime in relation to the governance and financial stability of the sector, AHBs seeking such funding have to enter into contracts with local authorities under the terms of the various schemes. The contracts provide the terms and conditions under which the AHBs may receive the funding, including provisions in relation to appointing receivers in the event of a default on the loan, so as to ensure the continued use of the relevant property for social housing purposes. If an AHB becomes insolvent and has yet to pay off any capital debts owed to the State, the State retains a substantial interest in the housing assets and the units are not lost from the social housing stock.</p></reply>

Subsequently, Dublin City Council, as the designated development agency, began the process of drawing up a detailed masterplan or planning scheme for the area designated in the Government Order. </p>  <p>  A draft of this planning scheme was published for public consultation from late January 2017 to early March 2017. The draft planning scheme was further considered by the Council in May 2017, after which material alterations were published for 4 weeks from mid-June to mid-July 2017 for public consultation. The final SDZ Planning Scheme was approved by Dublin City Council on 2 October 2017, which decision was ultimately appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  My Department issued observations to Dublin City Council on the draft planning scheme in March 2017, which was followed by extensive engagement during April and May 2017 between my Department, Dublin City Council and NAMA and which also included interactions between my predecessor and the Housing Strategic Policy Committee of Dublin City Council, and local community interests. My Department made a further submission in July 2017 which noted the material alteration in relation to mixed tenure.</p>  <p>  All of the above interactions were concerned with determining an appropriate voluntary mechanism, whereby the private owners of the lands covered by the SDZ would agree to deliver additional social and affordable housing within the SDZ area, in conjunction with Dublin City Council and relevant housing providers, over and above the 10% statutory requirement under Part V, subject to satisfying value for money, procurement and qualitative criteria.</p>  <p>  In this context, my Department had no engagement with the receiver in control of these privately owned lands on or about the May 2017 decision by Dublin City Council to amend the draft planning scheme in respect of these matters.  Notwithstanding the fact that my Department has consistently advised that provision of additional social and affordable housing could be provided in the SDZ area through a consent-based and commercially grounded approach, the ultimate decision of the Council moved towards a mandatory approach, over and above the provisions of Part V.</p>  <p>  In November 2017, an appeal was lodged to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the receiver and other parties.  There was no engagement between my Department and the receiver ahead of this appeal.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, officials from my Department were in contact with representatives of both Dublin City Council and the receiver.  While these engagements were not formally minuted, their purpose was to encourage engagement between these two parties in relation to determining and putting in place an agreed way forward, if An Bord Plean&aacute;la ultimately approved the planning scheme. </p>  <p>  Details in relation to engagements between other parties which did not involve my Department, are a matter for those parties.</p></reply>

The relevant policy document, Irish Water First Fix Leak Repair Scheme for Domestic Water Customers, as approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities on 5 August 2015, is available at the following weblink - www.water.ie/for-home/first-fix/first-fix-leak-repair-scheme.pdf.</p>  <p>  The arrangements for the repair of leaks is an operational matter for Irish Water in which I have no direct involvement. However, I understand that Irish Water will repair a reported leak regardless of the size of that leak, within the parameters of its role as the public water services authority and subject to the criteria set out under the First Fix Free Scheme.

It is worth noting that further costs were incurred in administering the process such as training, publicity, workshops, material etc. which does not relate to one specific county.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2014&euro;</th><th>2015&euro;</th><th>2016&euro;</th><th>2017&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>51,000</td><td>15,000</td><td>50,327</td><td>36,673</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>28,000</td><td>30,000</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>50,000</td><td>55,815</td><td>35,500</td><td>69,231</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>35,000</td><td>0</td><td>33,608</td><td>11,734</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>0</td><td>15,000</td><td>0</td><td>31,200</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>15,000</td><td>0</td><td>9,763</td><td>6,000</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>10,000</td><td>12,000</td></tr><tr><td>Gaeltacht Service Towns</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>An Cloch&aacute;n Liath, Co Donegal</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>B&eacute;al an Mhuirthead, Co Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, Co Kerry</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>9,749</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny, Co Donegal</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Language Networks</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Loughrea, Co.

As the process is moving forward this year from the preparation of plans to their implementation, the whole fund has been directed towards the process as well as to a number of specific new measures that will be funded centrally as additional support for the language planning process.</p><p>The language planning process is now underway in all 26 Gaeltacht areas and the first six language plans have been approved.  Five further plans are currently being assessed by the Department with the expectation of approving them in the near future.  An allocation of up to &euro;100,000 will be provided over a 12 month period in respect of each area in order to begin implementing the plans.  An additional &euro;50,000 will be allocated in respect of 5 specific language planning areas due to particular challenges associated with these areas.</p><p>The preparation of plans is in hand in relation to the Gaeltacht Service Towns of Letterkenny, Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, and the cities of Galway and Cork, while it is anticipated that work will begin this year to prepare plans in respect of Dungarvan, Tralee, An Cloch&aacute;n Liath and Castlebar.  </p><p>Preparation of plans continues in relation to the Irish Language Networks of Ennis, Loughrea and Clondalkin, with plans expected to be submitted for approval by end of year.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding is allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.</p><p>In 2018, I allocated funding of &euro;6.377M to the Heritage Council as part of the annual Estimates process. This represents an increase of &euro;123,000 on the 2017 allocation, which, in turn, had been increased by over &euro;1 million on the 2016 allocation. </p><p>The Programme mentioned by the Deputy is very popular and successful in raising awareness and appreciation of our national heritage. I am informed by the Heritage Council that the Programme is fully booked for this year. I understand, however, that the Council is examining whether it can identify further funding to allow the Programme to expand and meet increased demand.  </p><p>I also understand that the Heritage Council plans to develop the Programme further as part of their new Strategic Plan which will be published shortly.</p><p>More detailed information on this Programme and the Heritage Council&rsquo;s other activities is available on its website or by contacting the Council directly.</p></reply>
